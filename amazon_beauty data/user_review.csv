A192TR06IXSTBL," This is such a great series. I've been watching it every night since I purchased it. I had the earlier double disc collection which I hated. Gave  them away and thanks so much to Shout Factory I'm enjoying this complete collection of THE BOB NEWHART SHOW. Plus comes with bonus features. No disappointment here. I have a copy of this dvd but it seems that the color of the grinch is wrong. He looks more yellow than green. The colors are off. I don't know if I got A bad copy. I don't know if anyone has this problem. This is the best collection to own. I saw it on amazon and had to get it before it disappears and the price goes up. Now the packaging is really bad. The DVDs are doubled and very crowded, when you open the box the DVDs are loose. I put them all in DVD envelopes and snapped off the DVD holders and put them back in the box. I purchased volumes 1-9 for a very good price. Some sellers aren't greedy and have good deals. This show is so much fun to watch and the skits are great. I love the Carol Burnett show. Now I'm trying to get more shows from the none greedy sellers. I can't believe that some sellers want over 200 dollars for 1 DVD,that's so greedy and should be banned. Hopefully no one will ever buy there high priced items. This is the best collection to own. I saw it on amazon and had to get it before it disappears and the price goes up. Now the packaging is really bad. The DVDs are doubled and very crowded, when you open the box the DVDs are loose. I put them all in DVD envelopes and snapped off the DVD holders and put them back in the box. I love this series, it's just so much fun to watch. where is season three? we've been patiently waiting and no mention of the last season. We want to complete our collection. I have the black n whites n wouldn't trade them for colorized. I like to see them that way because that's the way they were filmed,besides sometimes they do a horrible job when colorized. This is a great series n fun to watch. Very entertaining. This is a great series and terrific packaging. The only downside is the discs are double sided which I hate. But I'm so glad I purchased these when I did. Now there very pricey. I love Laverne n Shirley season 4. Where are the rest of the seasons. We want more, why do they stop bringing out the rest. These are great shows, Happy days is another they stopped at season four. Now the new crappy shows that are not worth a dime like Jersey shore come out so quick. It's such a shame. Joey is a great series but the sellers are so greedy. Who in there right mind would pay all that money. These sellers should not be allowed to do this. They should be banned. I love Laverne n Shirley season 4. Where are the rest of the seasons. We want more, why do they stop bringing out the rest. These are great shows, Happy days is another they stopped at season four.

I love this series, and thank goodness sony will be releasing the third season. I still have all the albums on records and love those songs. Hope the forth season won't be too much of a wait. Thanks sony. I love this series. I don't understand why companies stop putting out seasons. They start but don't finish. This happens alot I have incomplete seasons of shows. Lavern n Shirley The Fifth Season is finally comming out after so many years. Let's keep our fingers cross for Happy Days. I've been so thrilled with the release of the Rhoda episodes. I love this series, but what about season 5?. Will shout release the last season so we can complete the collection. I have the last season on VHS but would be great to have all on DVD. Lets go Shout whats taking so long. This is an amazing mega set. This is the way to do it. If you're a fan you have to get this. The best way is to buy it from Time Life, you get the best price there. You won't be disappointed. What can I say about this lovable character, Hazel is fun loving, kooky, and just plain lovable. she rules the house and  she's the most loving maid there could be. Watching Hazel makes me yearn for the old simpler days. I don't know what season three will look like, will they be remastered or what, but I don't care,all I know is that Hazel is back on DVD for season three and that makes me happy. I wasn't too keen on watching this movie thinking it was gonna be a so so movie. Well let me say, this turned out to be a well told true story. I enjoyed it very much. Ron Howard is a great director and this movie is one to be proud of. Rent it you won't regret it The biggest mistake they did was to let Flo leave Alice. She's a wonderful character and fun to watch but I'm not too crazy about the Flo series. Spinoffs are tricky and I feel that this one just didn't work. Still it's great that they release this series so we Flo fans can get a chance to see it. I have the three seasons of whats happening plus its great that they have the first season of Whats Happening Now it would be great if they would come out with seasons 2 and 3. So we can complete the collection of Whats Hapoening Now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A7Y6AVS576M03," Looking back this film made its mark in its day. It seems less a definitive stylistic thriller today since the impact upon its initial release. However, it is a great look at the not to distant past. This was an ""in"" film, a film you had to see. What I like about it is the location photography, production design and a young Tommy Lee Jones. Times have sure changed right before our eyes. I thought CHAPLIN was a good film. It seems a bit uneven at times, but still it is a good film. I love John Barry's score. I had this on VHS and decided to get the Blu-ray. It is a magnificent copy of the film. I saw the trailer for this film numerous times in the theatre. I thought it was going to be another run of the mill comedy that just happens to take place in a greasy fast food joint. Not even close! This movie is strange and should someday earn cult status. Besides I like watching Drew Barrymore. This is quite an interesting film. In fact, it is quite disturbing. Even if you are far ahead of the game, this film will still captivate you. What depths will the human soul be subjected to, to that which is evil in the world? Haunting scenes permeate this film and the riveting finale is beyond all that can be imagined. Isaac Hayes and Yaphet Kotto in TRUCK TURNER. Can't help but like this one. Kotto is an actor's actor. Hayes had some kind of gentle power that always intrigued me. A classic film in many ways. Great title. Looking at this film objectively and trying not to make any comparisons to the original I found it to be just average filmmaking. The story and character development is very minimal. The denouement is just ridiculous. If you were a kid when this movie was first released you may regard it as an indelible cult classic. You may have fond memories of it. However, if you were sophisticated movie frequenter even when you were a youngster you may regard it with lesser endearing sentimentality. But let's just take the high road or the glass half full and just savor the moment and pay homage to the memories and joy it brought to so many children This film boasts great choreography by the great Hermes Pan. It is a remarkable Rodgers and Hammerstein musical about a Chinese girl who smuggles herself into San Francisco as a ""picture bride"" under contract to marry a young man she has never seen. Nancy Kwan, James Shigeta, Miyoshi Umeki, Juanita Hall, Benson Fong, and Jack Soo are all excellent. Henry Koster directed this very entertaining film. This is one of Rock Hudson's best light comic films. I saw it when I was a kid and I really enjoyed it. It still holds up today. A film may be light and it may be comic but as the best of its kind it has something to say about how we as human beings conduct our lives. This is a good film. This is an excellent comedy adventure film full of action and suspense. It's one of those heist movies that used to be popular. Ronald Neame tightly directed this film for full dramatic-comic impact. It contains an admirable score by Maurice Jarre. Not bad. REDS is a tour de force from writer and director Warren Beatty. This movie tells the true story of John Reed who was an American journalist around the time of World War I in Russia and his efforts to bring their ideological notions back to the United States at the time of the October Revolution in 1917. It entertains and informs and has commentary in segments of actual participants of these events. Fascinating stuff. In essence this is a dark film of personal dreams, ambitions and personal failures. And what about love? Yes, failures and dreams dashed upon the rocks of our hopes. Often we choose not to speak and in the end tragically repress feelings of true love as we see happen with Judy Garland and James Mason in this film. Essentially, all is lost. Heartbreaking as this film is, it draws you in. Director George Cukor had a way about that. This laserdisc copy of David Lean's GREAT EXPECTATIONS is a masterpiece from the Criterion Collection. The Criterion Collection always had the highest reputation for their laserdisc releases. GREAT EXPECTATIONS is simply wonderful. For me, this is one of director David Lean's unsung masterpieces. ZARDOZ is director John Boorman's classic tale of future events. This came at a time when Sean Connery was giving up his James Bond image. ZARDOZ was one of the greatest ""sleepers""of its time. This DVD combined with the film's shocking ending is very good. This is a great movie. The music numbers are so esoteric as is the entire film. Johnny Depp was made for this movie. When you think about it: how could any movie with Johnny Depp and Troy Donahue be bad? Just try to be a little more understanding about this film. It is more than just camp. This is a true look at society through the eyes of John Waters. Insightful. HOMEBOY is pure cinema at it's best. This is a visually stunning film. It is good to see a film seen through a pure cinematic eye. Images are what tell a story and this film does just that. Mickey Rourke seems made for this purist form of film making. I thought his performance was stunning and pensive and tender at the heart, at the core. This is a great character study of what drives a man. This is a very effective psychological war film with a great performance  by Broderick Crawford as the demented commander of a group of loose canons  located in an isolated jungle outpost during W.W.II. Robert Wagner is  ordered to the post for his transgressions and comes to terms with his own  lack of humanity. This film contains one of Hugo Friedhofer's best scores.  The stereo score on this VHS recording sounds excellent. Burt Reynolds in the title role takes out revenge on Aldo Sanbrell and his gang in this extremely violent and unsympathetic Spaghetti Western. This film shows off Reynolds' great physique and athletic prowess (circa 1966) under Sergio Corbucci's direction. Ennio Morricone (Leo Nichols) composed a rather over the top pseudo-American Indian score which is just wild. The final confrontation between Reynolds and Sanbrell is so incredible it has to be seen. SOME CAME RUNNING. Frank Sinatra's showed that he was much more than just good voice with his pensive performance as Dave Hirsh. And Dean Martin as Bama Dillert his buddy mirrors the worldly side of Hirsh as self-destructs. This film contains a much overlooked Elmer Bernstein score. What a film. SOME CAME RUNNING. Frank Sinatra's showed that he was much more than just good voice with his pensive performance as Dave Hirsh. And Dean Martin as Bama Dillert his buddy mirrors the worldly side of Hirsh as self-destructs. This film contains a much overlooked Elmer Bernstein score. What a film. This move is absolutely hilarious! Yes, absolutely hilarious! John Cussack really shows that his talents, his acting range, certainly spans into the comedic genre! You can't beat the price! Very entertaining! This is a classic forerunner of the teenage horror genre. A college professor sensitively and believably played by Arthur Franz is exposed to a blood specimen of a thought to be extinct prehistoric fish, which unknowingly turns him into a dangerous bloodthirsty Neanderthal. This is actually a fun and entertaining movie that holds your attention. Competently directed by Jack Arnold (from New Haven). Good cast includes Troy Donahue, Joanna Moore and Whit Bissell. This is a good film. It is very subtle and not a typical John Wayne film. Director John Huston's pace is slow but well thought out. It is a well researched film and is a very good historical piece demonstrating the clash of Eastern and Western cultures. There is something magical about this film in its simplicity in examining the needs of the human heart. It is a comedy light in nature but handles its subject very well. It never fails to entertain and continues to draw you in with repeated viewings. Romance can be beautiful and charming and dear to the human spirit. This is the best tape to get from ""Tales from the Crypt"" by far. ""Split Second"" is the best and by far the spookiest. Timothy Dalton is very good in  ""Werewolf Concerto"" a very gross tale indeed. ""This'll Kill Ya"" is a great tale if you ever think about stretching the truth a wee bit and what may happen to you. These are all great episodes. HOW TO STEAL A MILLION is a thoroughly entertaining and highly underrated film. Audrey Hepburn and Peter O'Toole are perfectly matched in this film directed by William Wyler. Charles Lang's cinematography is very rich and colorful and gives it a sense of elegance. Director Ray Enright's GUNG HO! is a minor classic. Randolf Scott is always rugged and once more gives a very determined performance. Somewhat underrated because of its production vales, don't let that fool you. This is a very solid WWII film. It seems that one never tires of this film. It is just so entertaining. The script, the dialog, the acting, the sets, the colors, the editing,  Dimitri Tiomkin's score and Alfred Hitchcock's suspenseful direction in the  confined set all congeal into a now classic film (even though Hitchcock  somewhat played down the importance of this film in his list of directorial  achievements). This VHS copy looks much better than earlier releases of  this title. If the global conquest of earth by the forces of Evil hung in the balance and could be tipped in the favor for the good of all mankind by these three sorry looking men of distinguished yet long forgotten valor - let's just say that I hope you know some really good prayers. It could end up being a hot time in the old town tonight. If the global conquest of earth by the forces of Evil hung in the balance and could be tipped in the favor for the good of all mankind by these three sorry looking men of distinguished yet long forgotten valor - let's just say that I hope you know some really good prayers. It could end up being a hot time in the old town tonight. This doesn't look at all like the John Woo who directed Face/Off.  I would say that John Woo was way off mark with this one. Brian De Palma did a much  better job with the first, M:I-1. M:I-2 is all flash and no story.  There's not much more to say. We've seen all before. This is a very good early score from Jerry Goldsmith. It is very sensitive and reflective on the relationship of blind girl (Hartman) and black man (Poitier). Goldsmith received the 1965 Oscar nomination for this score. A good album. Read the book! Nice cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno, but, read the book! The only good scene is when Stephen Boyd confronts the Tower of Babble. This is the type of film that put good actors like Stephen Boyd, rest his soul, out of work. By the way, I must say that Stephen had nice eye shadow. That is a sad testament for a team of good filmmakers. I always enjoyed SATAN BUG. It is well made biological doomsday thriller directed by John Sturges. I always liked George Maharis and his dead pan, no-nonsense style is well suited as the hero and main character of the film. SATAN BUG is a solid, engrossing and suspenseful film. This is good film-making all around right down to the performances, the script, cinematography and Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score. Still waiting for the DVD! I actually enjoyed this movie. I found it to be very interesting and thoroughly engrossing.. The cast was first rate. The score composed by Trevor Rabin was very moving and effective. PAYBACK has always been an underrated film since the day it was released. It is gritty, brutal, filled with outrageous dark humor and a quirky collection of characters in one of the bet modern day film noir movies released at the close of the millennium.  Gibson is a force to reckon with. Bill Murray runs the gamut once again and he is now a modern day Scrooge. Is SCROOGED predictable? Yes it is. Predictable, but it works! There is some amount of magic at work here. Some holiday cheer, some laughs, some tears, some fears but it somehow remains a delightfully brooding and entertaining Christmas film that time of year. I thought I would not like it, but I was wrong! Bill Murray runs the gamut once again and he is now a modern day Scrooge. Is SCROOGED predictable? Yes it is. Predictable, but it works! There is some amount of magic at work here. Some holiday cheer, some laughs, some tears, some fears but is somehow a delightful and entertaining Christmas time of year film. I thought I would not like it, but I was wrong! I actually enjoyed this movie. I found it to be very entertaining. Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo and Denis Leary are unparalleled. As remakes go this is one of the better ones as of late. This film was made as one of Brosnan's non-Bond films during his tenure as 007. I still prefer the original. None of the voices of the characters sound the same as when I was a kid. I just wanted to get that out of the way first. I thought it was a good  children's movie and was very glad that it was released in theatres. That  makes it a genuine movie unlike those that are made for video. CITY is the Best TREK episode Ever. Need I say more? The dramatics of this episode have never been matched. They never will be. They don't make them like this anymore. This film is unbelievable. It brings the audience all the way to the end of the film and then the filmmakers really don't have an ending. You essentially get another ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE type ending, which has been used too many times now. After seeing MISSION TO MARS I can now appreciate a film like EVENT HORIZON which chose a graphically violent alternative but dared to be different and challenge the viewer. I was very driven to this film. I was completely captivated by this movie and its subtle nuances. There is something warm and tender in the story and animation that never overshadows the sensitive nature of its characters. It is hard to explain the attraction of this film, but I was completely swept up by the experience. This is such a sensitive film that touches the heart. THE LIGHT AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD is a great atmospheric adventure tale based on the novel ""Le Phare du bout du monde"" by Jules Verne. This film rather Gothic in nature has an island Lighthouse keeper (Kirk Douglas) up against a pirate (Yul Brynner) seeking him out of the past. A beautiful score composed by Piero Piccioni. All we hear is the voice of determination. Suspense and action are good, but he can't save this movie that is played out in very bad taste. Or can they? Suspense and action? Yes! Every other word seems to be a four letter word or three letter word?  The idea behind the plot was very good. Children should not watch this movie. S.W.A.T. Bing this film back! This was one of Sam Peckinpah's latter fims that has been greatly neglected. When this film was released you had to read the fine print on the poster to learn that Sam Peckinpah had even directed it. That was a shame. This is a minor cult film, but the fans are growing in number. In essence this is a dark film of personal dreams, ambitions and personal failures. And what about love? Yes, failures and dreams dashed upon the rocks of our hopes. Often we choose not to speak and in the end tragically repress feelings of true love as we see happen with Judy Garland and James Mason in this film. Essentially, all is lost. Heartbreaking as this film is, it draws you in. Director George Cukor had a way about that. This film glamorizes everything that is wrong with our society. Just take one look at the cover. Is that the type of public behavior that you want to teach your children? Skip this for your own sake. Besides, it's not funny even when it tries to be. This film glamorizes everything that is wrong with our society. Just take one look at the cover. Is that the type of public behavior that you want to teach your children? Skip this for your own sake. Besides, it's not funny even when it tries to be. There is the sound of stinging leather being applied to quivering flesh. This is followed by the terrifying resonance of a female victim. This whole film is nothing but a collection of ridiculous would be horrifying sounds. There is really nothing visual to this film that would even make it slightly interesting.  Our female victims get put on mock trial with unimaginative results. That's about it!  The best thing about this DVD is its titillating and enticing cover. Gene Hackman and his brilliant performance steal this film. It was a funny film and somewhat overlooked when released. When he meets his cinematic fate, the film dies with him. It somehow has not stood the test of time. Rather unfortunate. Always good to see Ray Liotta. This film does have its moments, just the same. This is a film driven more by characters and character motivation than by plot. However, it really fails to explore or develop these characters in any significant depth. Ultimately, the film's downfall is that it contradicts itself repeatedly, which destroys all continuity rendering it impotent of any legitimacy. Ultimately the denouement is an insult to all of us. John William's innovative and thought provoking score is of little consequence. The DVD extras add nothing. This is a film driven more by characters and character motivation than by plot. However, the film's downfall is that it contradicts itself repeatedly, which destroys all continuity rendering it impotent of any legitimacy. Ultimately the denouement is an insult to all of us. This film is rather tedious and  quite uninteresting. The cinematography gives the film a busy look lending to its mediocrity.  The actors look tired and board as is the script. Go back to Episode One and savor the moment. Tuesday Weld really rocks. This is a very good movie. In fact, it is extremely well done all around. The acting was very effective and convincing. I particularly liked the cinematography and music.  Also, the script worked on many levels making it appealing to a wide audience. I found this film to be both entertaining and thought provoking. A lot of fun. The execution of this film defies credibility but some outrageous character portrayals and performances make this film entertaining. I found some car enthusiasts who really like this film and others who find it ludicrous and berate it. After all is said it does not fail to entertain. One of Disney and PIXAR's best. It gives real depth to all the characters. Above and beyond. They all seem so real. I laughed and I cried. You will really fall in love with this movie. I have seen it four times now. I can't wait to see it again. The kids in school just loved it. The images and voices really made it work. This is a very strange and moody film that is very engrossing once you have been submerged into its subterfuge. This film truly leaves the viewer with a feeling that can be somewhat described as off-kilter to say the least. This haunting submarine tale is somewhat reminiscent of several episodes of the TWILIGHT ZONE television series as I can recall. This is an outstanding DVD. This horror film looks like something out of the late 20th century of movies made that fit into that genre. Nothing really special here except that there is a lot more action than you would expect. It also seems to play out a lot more realistic than one would also expect. This is a very impressive cinematic rework of Batman's origins. The cast is first rate. The score is moody yet very dynamic. The plot is also very solid. This Batman film succeeds on every level. This is one of Robert Altman's better films and falls into a more traditional category of filmmaking but with many of his unique touches for character development pointing out the prominent idiosyncrasies of the members of his ensemble. Good performances do abound and the methodical plot moves ever so surreptitiously and comes to some very interesting revelations. This film seems to have grown much better with time proving that reflection is a good thing.

Good performances do abound and the methodical plot moves ever so surreptitiously and comes to some very interesting revelations. This film seems to have grown much better with time proving that reflection is a good thing. I like almost everything that Andrew V. McLaglen directs. This film has quite a lot of good things to recommend it. Mostly I like the opening Civil War scene and later Wayne, Rock Hudson and company doing battle with the invading French down in Mexico. There's enough humor, action and emotion to go around not to mention Hugo Montenegro's very good score. THE JUNGLE BOOK 2 is mildly entertaining. I suppose your children and their will enjoy it. However, every time I watch, I yearn for the original that somehow seems forgotten and overlooked. James Cameron and Steven Soderbergh's SOLARIS is a powerful yet subtle film. On equal footing, George Clooney's low-key performance is also powerful. Strange phenomena aboard a lonely space station are at the center of this film but it moves into deeper psychological regions that are very thought provoking. This film's production is perfunctory at best. Once more the viewer is confronted with yet another go around of what was not that brilliant of an original film in the first place. One can only sigh. The esoteric and sophisticated homespun humor of GREEN ACRES will never be forgotten. This DVD edition will see to that. I used to wonder what all the fuss was about concerning this TV show. Now that I am older (I don't know about wiser) I finally get it. Great enjoyment. Thought provoking wit. Season One set the mold. SHATTERED GLASS is an interesting film. It is rather engrossing. The characters do seem a bit shallow, but I guess that was the intent of the filmmakers. What is truth, half truths and total fabrication? Good question. These days I hardly believe anything I read based on the intent of the author or supposed author. But then again, perhaps that is the point. I love this show. The second season was the best in my opinion. They refined the format and smoothed out the filming and editing and the camaraderie between the characters really worked in this season. These are very powerfully absorbing films. The extended scenes lend to the texture and depth of the overall narrative. These extensions are very much welcome. Visually, each film is stunning and combined with the moving and haunting sounds immerse the viewer into seemingly richly textured and multifaceted landscapes of the fantastic vision of their world. Absolutely captivating in every sense. I was very touched by this film. It is much deeper than I imagined while viewing it. The images still remain with me. I think this is a great film because it touches the human heart and soul. You get Blazing Saddles, Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety, History of the World Part 1, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, Silent Movie, To Be or Not To Be and The Twelve Chairs! This is an amazing collection! What more can be added or said? These are classics and very unique as only Mel Brooks could have delivered them. Guy Green's THE MAGUS is a forgotten gem. It is a bit off the beaten path, but that is the beauty of this overlooked film. Michael Caine, Anthony Quinn, Candice Bergen and Julian Glover were all quite good and convincing. Games abound in this offbeat affair and I still remember it to this day. I love this film. I love this stuff. If you grew up with Walt Disney you should find this well worth your time just for the memories it evokes. The transfers look impeccable and all I can say is that I was very pleased. IMAX:DEEP SEA is a beautifully captivating and wondrous film of the living seas. This is majestically bold and beautiful. It is simply breathtaking. I don't come by this type of entertainment every day. This film is steep in wondrous beauty. When I was a lad this would have been one of my favorites forever! ROCKY BALBOA is a bit of an endearing film. It was good to see Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, Burt Young as Paulie and Tony Burton as Duke (Rocky and Apollo Creed's trainer). Rocky had to give it one last shot and get it out of his system. It was well worth the elegiac journey. Rocky's fight scene in this Blu-ray edition should look fantastic since that sequence was shot with digital cameras. ROCKY BALBOA is a bit of an endearing film. It was good to see Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, Burt Young as Paulie and Tony Burton as Duke (Rocky and Apollo Creed's trainer).

These were great films. These were inspiring films. They lifted your spirits and gave you hope. It is great have them all here. Now I can place them on my bookcase and take one of the films out whenever and give it another look from time to time. Finally, all the Rocky films are here in one set.

His imagination and creativity are but a handful of those that have remained a constant in our lives. HORTON HEARS A WHO seems immediately so endearing, like some half forgotten friend we once grew up with. Hard to explain. Just feel it. The images, sights and sounds and story are beautiful and together very enjoyable and heart warming. I love this film. The film's visuals, dialogue, music and sound were stunning yet are characterized by offsetting subtleties that the overall effect is rather numbing yet thoroughly thought provoking. It has been several months since I saw this film in the theater but it still lingers with me. A very subtle yet powerful masterpiece from Martin Scorsese. James Mangold is a good director and I like Hugh Jackman's performance. It is powerful. I found the storyline and dialogue to be outstanding. There is a lot of energy up there on the screen, but it does not translate emotionally. It has that emotional charge that really engages you. THE WOLVERINE is just as engaging as director's James Mangold's highly underrated COP LAND. This film is a powerhouse of entertainment. Don't miss it! VALKRIE is an excellent WWII film chronicling the assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler. Great cast. Good direction. Suspenseful. This film holds your interest throughout even though Hitler escaped the assassination attempt virtually unharmed. Yet, it is the conspirators, their actions and fate, that holds your interest. MISS MARCH the (Unrated Fully Exposed Edition) is hit and miss as a comedy, but is funny in a crude sort of way. It is a curious little film to be sure. Idiotic? Certainly to be sure. You just kind of got to see films like this to keep your perspective. Do you really believe that! ARMY OF DARKNESS is an interesting combination of genres and actually quite entertaining. Mixing genres seems to be in vogue in filmmaking for some time now and this one works. If you want to turn it off, but then say to yourself ""I want to see what happens"" then you have something there.  Wait a minute. This movie is totally bizarre. I love it and watch over and over again! This movie is still totally awesome! How many years ago was it released? It seems like yesterday. This movie is actually totally freaking awesome! They pulled it off. I never thought they would. I never thought they could. This movie is an absolute mind blowing experience. This movie is one for the books. It is a must see adventure. I really do love it when a plan comes together! HEMINGWAY & GELLHORN is an interesting film. Nicole Kidman steals this film with her performance. Actual footage edited and digitally integrated with the newly shot footage with the actors is quite effective. This film is worth watching. If you like Hemingway, this is a good springboard film to enter the world he lived and thrived in. The intimate scenes with the film's two stars are quite risqu&eacute;. THE HELP is very touching and moving. It is a totally engaging film on so many levels. This is a film you can return to again and again. It is thoroughly enjoyable and enchanting. There is a lot to think about in this film. Growing up, I saw some of  this first hand. Glad that person, you know who, got to eat her pie. That made me smile. This is an outstanding WWII film about the US Army Infantry in Italy during WWII. The focus is on the men. Life or death met them in the face every step of the way. Outstanding drama. They don't make them like this any more. THOR's cast of Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston and Sir Anthony Hopkins are excellent. I thought Kenneth Branagh's direction was very good. The story line was captivating. THOR has been around a while and this film captured the very essence of his realm. This is truly magnificent and quite stunning visually and on every other level. It stands solidly beside the Lord Of The Ring trilogy. It is totally absorbing, very moving and absolutely entertaining. I was very pleased. I truly recommend this one. GOLD is a very good film. Directed by Peter Hunt and staring Roger Moore in one of his best performance, GOLD is thoroughly captivating and entertaining. Gold also contains one of composer Elmer Bernstein's bet score and a theme song sung by Jimmy Helms. Why do men dig for gold? This film put that question to you. The great cast also includes Susannah York, Bradford Dillman, John Gielgud and Ray Milland. Groundbreaking in many ways. What I loved most was the transition of characters through the seasons and the amazing occurrences that transpired. Truly amazing stuff. The plot twist and turns. Not your ordinary run of the mill show. This sci-fi action film is outstanding! Bruce Willis nails it! The plot is very engrossing and imaginative, but it is Bruce Willis' performance that makes this film work. This film was a magnificent surprise! It blew me away! The edge of your seat action and suspense were just too incredible for words! This is another must-see film! This is a powerful survival film that works on many levels. It is haunting in nature as the underlying psychological implications become blurred. I was expecting something different and as this film unfolded I became totally engrossed by the somewhat mythological and operatic sights and sounds of man alone, yet not alone. The pace is lethargic and mystical in nature. The payoff is introspective. The forces at work are powerful and test the fabric of what we truly are. This movie is kind of awesome! This movie is subtly awesome! They pulled it off. I never thought they would. I never thought they could. This movie is an absolute mind blowing experience but in a subtle thought provoking way. This movie is one for the books. Definitely. G.I. Joe: Retaliation is an all out fun film and definitely a more entertaining and well-made film than its predecessor. We really enjoyed this one. Needless to say, we all felt energized after seeing it. This is slam bang entertainment all the way. The cast is awesome and there is some really good crackling dialogue that keeps this action flick moving. Enjoy! Adele Live At The Royal Albert Hall in this Blu-ray/CD combo pack is very impressive. It is beautifully done and looks and sounds terrific. Actually I was surprised how well this was produced. It is an exceptional experience. Adele continues to amaze. TCM Greatest Classic Legends Film Collection: Doris Day in (Calamity Jane / Please Don't Eat the Daisies / Love Me or Leave Me / Romance on the High Seas) The transfers look fantastic. I was very pleased. A great gift idea too! SPARTACUS and TOUCH OF EVIL and HARVEY. Well that is an interesting selection of films to combine. SPARTACUS is an incredible and emotionally charged film and an endearing one. HARVEY is also endearing. TOUCH OF EVIL is a masterpiece of sight and sound. What makes this trio of films work is the diversity, yet they all show the power of good filmmaking. DEAD IN TOMBSTONE has the makings of a cult classic. Danny Trejo gives a gritty performance in this devil may care tale of revenge. Danny Trejo's trip from beyond the grave is spellbinding in every sense of the word. Mickey Rourke's Satanic presence is an absolute send up as only Rourke can give you. This may be director Roel Rein's masterpiece. Interesting film depending how you look at it. This is not",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
necessarily original or innovative film making. Yet, the characters sketched out save this film. There is good acting here. Great character studies. The surround sound was very impressive. What else are summers for? I liked it. THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES is a good movie. There were several bumps in the road that kept this to be a very interesting film. The film's trailer did not do this film justice. There is definitely more here and then some. Boardwalk Empire: The Complete Third Season is a real powerhouse of entertainment. Of the first 3 seasons, this season is definitely in high gear and arguably the best so far. Steve Buscemi is absolutely one of the best actors around. The operatic quality of this production is simply enthralling and captivating. Once you watch this show it has a very curious way of hooking the viewer to beg for more! Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey and Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson will astound you with raw energy and stoic courage. The performances alone are exhilarating. The storyline is well paced and drawn. The heroics of the American spirit are uplifting. This is a feel good move. I was waiting for another classic baseball movie to come along. I think this one is here to stay. WHITE HOUSE DOWN is a very good and emotionally charged movie. Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx are excellent! The story is also excellent. The action and political twists and turns will keep you on the edge of your seat. We really enjoyed this movie and were thinking of seeing it again. Dark, brooding, brutal... The Dark Knight returns and and he is older, wiser and unforgiving. Only the passage of time could have taken him to this place and the world may indeed remain dark forever. Gotham stands on the brink of the abyss and only Batman can possible saves the remnants of what once was. PACIFIC RIM is incredible. Awesome, incredibly awesome! This is a sparkling piece of entertainment. Thoroughly engaged in this film. The effects were mesmerizing. There is a lot more here than anyone expected. Go for it! Yes, I say, go for it! It does not get any better this! These special effects, I mean, they were just amazing. Awesome, incredibly awesome! This is a sparkling piece of entertainment. Thoroughly engaged in this film. The effects were mesmerizing. There is a lot more here than anyone expected. Go for it! Yes, I say, go for it! It does not get any better this summer! Director Edgar Wright's THE WORLD'S END is one heck of a movie. I did not know what to expect. This is a really cool movie. I found myself enjoying this odd film. Five guys reunite after 20 years to go for the drinking marathon of all time and get more than they bargained for. Very intriguing all the way! Very endearing too! I was intrigued by this curious film. I believe it is good film making. It does not really engage you as you watch. Rather, the images and dialogue sink in after you have seen it. It sort of lingers with you. Ultimately, I liked it. Ron Howard's RUSH is absolutely amazing. It caught me way off guard. Wow! This is an amazing film. It is high powered. It is excellently acted! It has energy in every aspect of the production. This may be one of the best race car movies ever made. It is thoroughly captivating and you never want the adrenalin rush to end. It is a must see film in every respect. A quality production in every respect. It blew me away. Fun, action, laughs and good times role in 2 GUNS. Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg are mesmerizing in this buddy movie extravaganza. There is never a dull moment. 2 GUNS truly rocks. Director Baltasar Kormkur gave us Mark Wahlberg in CONTRABAND in awesome sleeper of a movie. Kormkur outdoes himself here with Washington and Wahlberg. They seem like naturals in this film. Yes, I recommend it. This will rock you! This sci-fi action film is outstanding! Bruce Willis nails it! The plot is very engrossing and imaginative, but it is Bruce Willis' performance that makes this film work. This film was a magnificent surprise! It blew me away! The edge of your seat action and suspense were just too incredible for words! This is another must-see film! STOKER is a mysteriously hypnotic and dreamlike film from director Chan-wook Park. Events unfold and the enigmatic happenings visually unfold and mystify the viewer with their beauty and provocative nature. The narrative flow is simply these events that are often left to interpretation. This effect is fascinating and stimulating to the senses. SCENT OF A WOMAN and SEA OF LOVE were both very good Al Pacino films. They are totally different films from each other and Pacino gives very good performances in each. Well, Al Pacino's performance in SCENT OF A WOMAN may be his best. To the point, each of these films have terrific finales and that may be why these two were chosen to pair. FIVE DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON is another classic film from director Mario Brava. Released in 1970 this film features  William Berger (SABATA) who masterfully unfolds his master scheme on his unsuspecting guests like a chess grandmaster.  And then there were none? Perhaps and then some. This atmospheric and moody film is very enticing. I found THE LONE RANGER to be innovative and quite entertaining. Gore Verbinski's direction is thoroughly engaging and invigorating. I wasn't sure what to expect. In a way it goes back to basics literally with a good dose of action thrown in for good measure. Hans Zimmer's score was exceptionally moving and rousing in many ways. This is a good piece of entertainment. Interesting film depending how you look at it. This is not necessarily original or innovative film making. Yet, the characters sketched out save this film along with some good visual effects. There is good acting here. Great character studies. The surround sound was very impressive. What else are summers for? Movie going? Yes. I liked it. I believe this film is worth a look. Dogged energy abounds. THOR: THE DARK WORLD is visually stunning. To tell you the truth, I just can't get enough of these films as of late. This one as a definite edge to it, yet there is humor and romance. The story is enthralling, the action is top notch. I really liked it. Thor has always been a bit different than his other super hero compatriots. LABOR DAY is highly underrated and often overlooked. This is such an intimate story and film. Kate Winslet and Josh Brolin together have such a chemistry in this film that is so erotic, yet restrained and it is simply implied. It is a beautiful film. There is warmth and feeling here like I have never felt. BB KING: The LIFE OF RILEY narrated by Morgan Freeman was truly enlightening, informative and very interesting. This is such a well made, thought out and expertly produced presentation. The archival footage was amazing. I was hooked right from the start. I always like THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE. I never really found it as frightening as some other classics of the genre. Instead it has more of a thinking man's quality to it. But it does have something that evokes emotions. I would not call it fear, but instead it resembles something very creepy that is also very erotic and sensual at times. Pamela Franklin in this film seems so hauntingly alluring in every frame. THE PURGE: ANARCHY when insanity rules. Sure sounds a lot like Hollywood. Somewhat interesting in concept, but not for all tastes and in this day and age, not exactly my cup of tea. PENNY DREADFUL is highly innovative and beautifully presented entertainment set in Victorian London. I simply was mesmerized by it. The scripting, cast, score, graphics, costumes and photography are quite alluring, haunting and mesmerizing. I highly recommend this one. Josh Hartnett is very impressive and is simply underrated as an actor. EXODUS: GODS AND KINGS is an absolutely breathtaking film visually stunning retelling of biblical and actual events. It is very moving in a totally different sense from its predecessors. In many ways the leaves much of the interpretation of the narrative to the viewer. I found the film to be very thought provoking, somewhat solemn, but majestic and powerful in a very contemplative manner. CAKE is interesting on that it takes on several issues often swept under the rug. The performances were good and the subject matter was presented in an intelligent and at times moving fashion. I some whow wanted more depth. Still a good film if you are of a mind to see it. Fun, action, laughs and good times role in 2 GUNS. Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg are mesmerizing in this buddy movie extravaganza. There is never a dull moment. 2 GUNS truly rocks. Director Baltasar Kormkur gave us Mark Wahlberg in CONTRABAND in awesome sleeper of a movie. Kormkur outdoes himself here with Washington and Wahlberg. They seem like naturals in this film. Yes, I recommend it. This will rock you! HANNIBAL: SEASON 3 is brutal artist psychological storytelling. It is visually stunning and mesmerizing. What is real? What is imagined? What is reality? Is there reality? Very complex and spellbind storytelling. This is an intriguing and beguiling Errol Flynn film. Errol Flynn puts the viewer through a gamut of emotions and flexing loyalties for his character. Perhaps a flawed film, it remains intriguing for what Errol Flynn did with his character. Errol Flynn demonstrates a great range of histrionics and an unusual and much deeper talent for his craft. Do not waste your money on this very bad copy of this film. We studied this in school years ago. This copy has not only been edited but the image quality is very poor. You can try to help the image quality by lowering the contrast control on your TV. DYNASTY had its time and place. It was on top for a while. My thoughts always go back to the image of Blake Carrington. That is an indelible image. Final thoughts of a Dynasty. Despite much talk and disagreement as to who contributed what to it, REBECCA is definitely an Alfred Hitchcock film. Producer David O. Selznick hands-on approach to producing definitely is evident, yet the film does not look entirely like your typical Selznick movie for that period. I would think this is director Alfred Hitchcock's doing. Yet again, it does not resemble the style that Hitchcock employed in his first American film, FOREIGN CORESPONDENT. 5 AGAINST THE HOUSE is an odd little film with a great title and cast. This is an interesting film noir caper from the 50's. The cast is what makes it interesting and they include Kim Novak, Kerwin Mathews, Brian Keith, Guy Madison," William Conrad and Alvy Moore. Stirling Silliphant worked on the script.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AKL7KV8RKCO3Y," This movie is a great one. I was surprised to see that Willam Shatner could act. This was John Trovolta's first movie all though he didn't have a big role. Ernest Borgnine gave a real good preformance in this low budget  horror movie. Very good indeed. Really, NOTLD was a great movie, you cannot improve upon greatness, so don't try. I know John Russo worked on the screenplay to the first NOTLD, but he should have left it alone. All the talent must have been from the  great George A. Romero. John Russo should stick to skin filcks like his  Santa Calws and Scream Queen's Naked Christmas where nobody cares about a  story line. Leave the classics to someone who knows what they are  doing! Troma king of indie films has another great find here. It's a horror Movie with a lot of dark humor. I thought it was great, plus there are a lot a fimilar faces in it that you wouldn't expect to be in a low budget movie  such as this. A real treat for adults and kids alike. A monster that  travels around only through closets. What's not to like. This movie is not one of the best Troma films I've seen, but it's OK. The story is about a freakshow that uses all kinds of sadic acts on women. The film is discusting but some how I sort of liked it. The scene where a woman  gets her brains sucked out through a straw is a classic. When Rhino re-released this great film from the late 1950s they added their own touch to the Psycho-rama effects. Try to pause the tape at the right time to see what I mean. About the movie I thought it was rather good even though the Psycho-rama flashes distract from the story about a woman facing her fears in the house she fears. A great movie for a cold October night. Highly recomended!! Combat Shock is one of those movies you watch not because it's good. but because it is interesting. The story of a man's struggle with life after the Vietnam War, and what he cannot remember about what happened. When he  starts remembering it changes his life. In conclusion I would like to say  Combat Shock is the best movie I have seen about a man trying to cope with  life after a war. Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D. is a touching story of a New York cop who is transformed into Kabukiman to rid the world of The Evil One. This is diffently high TROMA. The video I have says PG-13 but I think it is most  likely a misprint. This is the second best Troma film made by the Troma  founders. The best being Tromeo & Juilet. It's worth watching over  & over. Enjoy! This is part 2 of Yuen Woo-Ping's Twin Warriors with Jet Li & Michelle Yoeh. Both films are great. In fact all of Yuen Woo-Ping's films are great. Buy and enjoy!!!!!!!!!!! Not as silly as the title suggests, but still silly. I loved this tender (yeah right) story of two aging sisters who receive a special gift on their birthday from their devil worshiping nephew, and all heck breaks loose.  Lots of blood and gore. Badly dubbed movie from Belgium. More funny than  scary. Interesting musical score. I could watch it again and again. This is a good Italian horror story that GRABS you and doesn't let go. The dubbing is awful, but when is dubbing not awful. Lots of gory speical effects. Troma picked up a good movie here. There should be a sequel. I thought this was the best movie in all of Troma I just wish somebody would put out a soundtrack from this movie and all the other songs Trey Parker has written. The main thing I liked about the movie was it was based  on a true story all though I think Trey changed a few things. I also would  like to see a sequel. Enjoy this movie for what it is a stupid movie. Don't waste your time worring about things like where there is a blizzard in the middle of summer, or about how long it takes to get to Alaska and back, why they have piranha and sea urchins and of course a helium tank, and bubble wrap ect. in a petstore. Just watch the movie. I watched it twice the same day, so it must be good. This is a good Bond movie, but it has been done before about 2 years before in The Spy Who Loved Me. Same story different location. Moonraker is in space Spy was under water. Why make the same movie twice in a row. It even has some of the same people in it (Ex. Jaws). But its not all bad good effects, but thats about it. Clearly brung about because of Star Wars. There are 2 DVD versions of this both are the same. The only difference is on the title to make it more marketable they put the word CENSORED over [an offensive word]. As for the program it was great well worth checking into. ENJOY!!!!!! This set is great but I know the audio soundtrack for most of or maybe all of the missing parts of the stories still survive I have most of them. What they should do is use the soundtrack and computer animation to recreate the missing episodes.  Thats just a thought. It would most likely be to expensive to do this but I would pay the price whatever it may be!!! The season 2 set of The Rockford Files will include the missing pilot, Backlash of the Hunter that was left out of the first season of the series. Better late than never!!! Enjoy this movie for what it is a stupid movie. Don't waste your time worring about things like where there is a blizzard in the middle of summer, or about how long it takes to get to Alaska and back, why they have piranha and sea urchins and of course a helium tank, and bubble wrap ect. in a petstore.

A lot of people have commented that the laugh track has been removed, it has been on some episodes but not all. Some episodes have the laugh tracks included.  Fans of old sitcoms will love this one,  Enjoy!!!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1QW1D1SCXFYG7," I think this is one of the best sitcoms of the '70s.  The cast of characters were all excellent in their roles and the humor was not like the juvenile crap that passes for humor now on television.  When I saw it was being released on video I pounced because I think this was Newhart at his best.  His show as the innkeeper had some funny moments, but not the wit of this show. You have to be a grinch not to like a Disney classic.  Though not up to the ""gold standard"" animation and production of ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Fantasia"" and ""Bambi"" Cinderella is a worthy successor.  The dress making scene is enchanting.  The tunes are hummable and the film a a joy to watch.  The extra inclusions are a real bonus too! This is quite an arresting premise for a film and the film delivers in spades.  It isn't something I watch often but the folks at Criterion have a knack for doing a tremendous job of getting the best possible print and support material.  I have several of their releases and have never been disappointed. This is an excellent addition to any Disney library.  The picture nearly jumps out at you and the depth is amazing.  There is a wealth of extra material for the Disneyphile (I guess I qualify).  They do an excellent job of packaging these classics.  I'm glad I got this one.  I've stayed with my non Blue-ray Snow White and Fantasia for ""purists"" sake but this, being a ""modern classic"" deserves the treatment it got. This is one of my favorite movies.  The two disc collector's edition is a must have for videophiles for some of the background.  In most cases I think just the movie itself will suffice, but no matter.  It is still a masterpiece. This is one of my favorite movies and is still as taught and tense as it was when it came out.  Probably William Wellman's greatest film.  The performances by Henry Fonda, Dana Andrews and the rest of the cast are exceptional.  It isn't necessarily fun to watch, but once you start you can't take your eyes off the screen.  A truly great motion picture. It is basically a silly Sonja Henie movie plot but the skating is first rate if you can get past the sappy plot and how callow Tyrone Power looked when he was just starting out. This isn't quite as funny as I remembered. After the ""pilot episode"" things go downhill a bit but still good for some laughs.  Mel Brooks silly side is a little too frantic to carry it all that far. This is great because it does have all three volumes together in Blu-ray.  The third volume has very interesting commentary from Lena Horne, Cyd Charisse and Gene Kelly.  Any film buff who loves the output of the ""Freed Unit"" should welcome this! This is a bad patchwork of many of the already available episodes with a hokey musical track added.  The sound quality is poor and many of the episodes have no end credits.  The set is filled out with Ralph Bellamy's ""Follow That Man"" which is lousy no matter how you slice it as is the Reed Hadley opus ""Racket Squad"" and the and the equally poor ""U.S. Treasury in Action"".  Save your money... I can't honestly review it.  I gave it as a birthday present to my older brother.  There was one movie in the collection that he didn't have in his collection.  I remember seeing them as a kid on television and thought they were a lot of fun.  He was thrilled to add it to his collection. If you love ""The Boys"" you can't do much better than this compilation of all the Hal Roach ""talkies"" they made.  I saw these cut and butchered on television growing up.  It is wonderful to see them uncut and uncensored (in a few cases).  A must for L&H fans! A very nice Valentine from Michael Mann.  It gave us Dennis Farina who was solid in this as well as a host of good character actors and a good plot line.  I really enjoyed seeing this.  I had seen sporadic episodes when it ran on the tube.  It was great to see the whole thing.  Not crazy about the ending, but it was a great ride while it lasted. This is probably (at least in my opinion) the best sitcom of all time.  The actors were top notch and stories funny without resorting to the ""Loosey, you got a lot of 'splaning to do"" that permeated a lot of what passed as humor for years.  Even after all these years the dialog is fresh and you can see people who will probably remind you of people you really know.  A true classic in every sense of the word. This is a truly enjoyable movie.  Clifton Webb is his acidic self, Ginger Rogers is great and the dialog is vintage ""Mr. Belvedere"" at his best.  A little dated now but still enjoyable I saw it years ago on a friend's VHS tape.  I thought it was a cute movie.  When I saw the Blue-ray picture on the anniversary I appreciated the detail and heart in the film.  It is a wonderful piece of movie making.  Spielberg's done all right... I love Jack Benny's comedy.  The major problem with the film is, that like a lot of things is dated.  I hadn't seen it in years and some of the references and bits are a little old.  Some of it is good, not just quite as funny as I remembered it from seeing it on television 50 years ago.  Perhaps the fact that George M. Cohan wrote the story has something to do with ""age"" factor. This is a excellent piece of work.  I taught history for 38 years and there was so much in this family's history it boggles the mind.  I'd recommend it to anyone no matter their political stripe.  Truly fascinating.  PBS and Ken Burns outdid themselves. This is one of the sappiest of the Henie musicals to hit the screen.  Just watching the nonsense of the plot along with feeble acting by Ethel Merman, Cesar Romero and Don Ameche make you want to turn it off.  But wait!  There's more!  Uninspired music aand sub-par skating.  Miss this if you can",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2Q7YBUV8IPTLW," As a fan of the original Avengers t.v. series I have to say that I was so excited when this movie was previewed with what I thought would be an outstanding cast that I can hardly contain my displeasure at how  predictable, boring and stupid this film was.  Although the performances  were credible the story was so bad that I wish I could get the price of  admission back. Save your money.  Trust me! Hey i'm a guy.  And guess what... I loved Thelma and Louise, A Leaugue of their own, The Color Purple, Somewhere in Time... and I could go on but why. I saw absolutely nothing and I do mean nothing special about this film.  I just don't get it. The premise of the movie is frightening and captivating at the same time.  I expected tremendous special effects, action and drama from a panicked public and government.  Instead I got an overated snore fest. Don't waste  your time. If not necessarily for dramatic value.  Although the story is certainly a compelling one the film is incredibly predictable.  What is worth noting however are the racial attitudes that existed for all negroes regardless of  skin tone by both white and colored people at that time. The storyline is interesting but the execution is mundane.  I've seen worse but i've seen much better. I do highly recommend The Rainmaker (a Grisham adaptation) directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Matt Damon, Danny Glover, Jon Voight, and Danny Devito.  Best Grisham on film yet. A brilliantly acted and directed look at the realities and complexities of Cold War / nationalist / nuclear politics and motivations.  It reminds you how personal the arms race is to ALL peoples. Quality viewing. If you read Leonard Maltin's review you'll have the whole movie in a nutshell. As a Star Trek Next Generation fan I was hoping for a film of similar quality, excitement and depth.  No such luck. The film is just flat out entertaining.  Forget about the fact that there's no way that the scenario would be played out as it is in the film but who cares.  These guys are hilarious and the biggest bunch of misfits that could possibly be requested to save all of mankind. The action is intense, the drama (at times) palpable, the laughter uproarious, and the sentiment heartfelt.  Eminently watchable. Although Mr. Brosnan's and Ms. Russo's performances are credible and the direction is commendable the script is lacking.  And that's not to say that I wasn't suprised by the ending... I certainly was but the romance was  staid, predictable and without real contrast or energy. It's worth  viewing just don't expect much more than some picturesque scenery and  clever thievery. The ending is a surprise but not a revelation if that makes any sense.  The only thing good about the film is the performance of the little boy.  The rest is just plain boring.  I would've walked out if I had been by  myself. The ending is a surprise but not a revelation if that makes any sense.  The only thing good about the film is the performance of the little boy.  The rest is just plain boring.  I would've walked out if I had been by  myself. It's a good thing that guys like George Clooney and Pierce Brosnan are so good looking because they couldn't get a job sweeping streets in Hollywood based upon their talent.  Please read David Talamantes review because it is  so accurate I had to laugh when I read it and I definitely don't want to  waste any more time on this film than I already have. Because seeing a nice guy just get abused by a bunch of snobby, pretentious, holier than thou schmucks just ain't my cup of tea.  All I could feel was sympathy for Stiller's character.  Although I have to admit I laughed at the volleyball scene.  So sue me. The major problem with this film is that it attempts to be sympathetic to women.  Commendable... as women are certainly deserving of greater respect and consideration than is generally afforded them in society at large. BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO FEEL SYMPATHETIC!  I wanted to laugh my a-- off which certainly Rob Schneider is capable of.  And despite there being a few funny scenes overall the movie just doesn't work. What a waste. The ending is brilliant!  And there are many very important issues that are broached with no concrete answers offered.  (Commendable)  However, some of the early and middle scenes of the film are obvious and boring.  Nonetheless you'll stay glued to the screen and be engaged by the plot and  the dialogue. Not a movie I feel like I'd want to see more than once but  it's an important film and should be seen by all americans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This rarely seen British Horror/SciFi Cult Classic was directed by Hammer Films Terence Fisher, who was responsible for the British Golden Age of Horror (1957-1968).

LUGOSI'S DRACULA IS STILL IN THE TOP 3 CREEPIEST DRACULA'S EVER, KARLOFF'S FRANKENSTEIN FEATURES ARE BY FAR THE BEST OF THE MONSTER/MAD DOCTOR FILMS OF ALL TIME,AND THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON WAS SO WELL MADE, IT SPAWNED IMITATORS TO THIS DAY. IT IS THE PERFECT MONSTERVISION MARATHON! Oh, the Classic Age of British Hammer Films Horror! From 1957 to maybe 1973 Hammer ruled Horror to a large degree, especially Gothic Period Horror. This Collection is a wonderful example of the Hammer Style with something for everyone! Frankenstein, Werewolf, Vampires, Mad Doctor, Phantom, Zombie Horsemen-and more! FrightFest starts right here in glorious gothic color! For this was when Hammer walked the earth! According to TOP 100 HORROR MOVIES, ""DARK INTRUDER"" is listed as 87 of the BEST! And I agree. Wonderful gothic settings, cloaked dark menacing stalker, chilling moods dominate this Chiller from 1965. In the other film, actress Barbara Stanwyck is filled with eerie dream visions at night. A Classic Double Chiller Thriller for late-night watching! ""MERMAID"" HONG KONG MADE FANTASY/ACTION/COMEDY-ROMANCE IS THE ULTIMATE MER-MOVIE! DIRECTOR STEPHEN CHOW MIXES LAUGHTER WITH TEARS IN THIS EPIC FILM ABOUT LOVE BETWEEN MAN AND FISHGIRL! BEAUTIFUL UNDERWATER EFFECTS ADD TO THE BEAUTY AND CHARM OF THIS INSTANT-CULT CLASSIC!

More of a 60's Study in Foreign Films with all the odd happenings and rich use of color! I recommend instead ""Santo Contra La Hija De Frankenstein"" (Santo vs. The Daughter of Frankenstein)a MUCH better Film! Viva La Frankenstein! Yes, Fans of B to Z~Grade Cinema, it just got that much more cheezier! Here we go: Women Wrestlers battling Mad Doctors and a Mummy!

Jon Pertwee goes on location again with assistance of the British Royal Navy! (Yes, real Navy Officers!) The creatures are fun, creepy and silly. Just what your Scifi-Creature Feature Marathon needs! I first discovered the ""Santos"" Movies in the summer of 2010. I am a Vintage Horror Collector and was very amused and captured by just how different these Films are in their interpretation of Horror and Fantasy! I highly recommend this DVD and also ""Santos VS. Frankenstein's Daughter"" also available on Amazon. It is a unique look at Mexico's 1960's Style of Horror. MONSTER BLOOD is one of the BEST in the Goosebumps Series! Non-stop creepy atmosphere, plenty Green Slime oozing all over the place, good acting, and the Stories added as a Bonus are scary with a few suprises! Highly Recommended! COOL OFF. RELAX.

AUPCERMZ6ASML," This is a heartwarming Christmas Classic to add to your collection.  It was the Christmas Pilot for the Walton's TV Series. Patricia Neal plays Olivia Walton and Andrew Duggan plays John Walton and Edgar Bergen plays Grandpa Walton.  But the rest are the original cast somewhat a little younger with the exception of Ike. My favorite Star Trek looks vibrant in HD and the sound is awesome.  I have a Roku that has the ability to download in HD 1080 streaming and through My Pioneer HD receiver the sound is awesome and the colors vibrant.  It looks like Capt Jean Luc Picard is on the bridge right in my living room. Monk is such an incredible series.  It is a great way to unwind after a busy day.  He makes you laugh as he solves incredible mysteries in the only way he knows how to solve them. If you are an Agatha Christie Buff this is a must have.  It has both her top sleuths on the case in this collection.  Miss Marple (Joan Hickson) who I consider the best portrayal and Poirot (David Suchet) who does an excellent job.  So you get the best of the best at an affordable price.  DVDs you will watch again and again.  The production is awesome perfect picture and surround sound.  I am very pleased. Not many movies you can take the kids to these days but this is one of them.  It is fun, witty and you don't have to cringe about what your children will see.  I would recommend this for a family night with your kids.  Bring the popcorn and enjoy the fun together. John Nettles is leaving Midsomer.  I believe he appears in Set 20.  We fell in love with this series.  Usually four ninety minute movies in each set.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat with suspense and laughter.  Tom Barney (John Nettles) plays chief inspector and will be replaced with his cousin.  Jones is the sergeant and will continue in the series.  This is well worth to add to your mystery collection! This is a must see movie.  There are not many videos about Apostle Paul but this is wonderful.  Robert Loggia portrays Paul and does an incredible job and there are also flashback appearances of Bruce Marchiano as Jesus.  One you will want to watch again and again I loved DSI Tom Barnaby in the Earlier Midsomer Murders. John Nettles quit the role of Tom Barnaby and now his brother John Barnaby has taken over the job of DSI at Causton. Does a pretty good job but you miss Tom, Joyce, and Cully. Detective Sgt Ben Jones is also in the new season. Great movie.  Shows how God's love can overcome obstacles even unforgiveness.  I loved this movie.  It is a must see for those who want to see love in action.  I would strongly recommend this movie as a must see.  It has a great twist in the ending. Loved the movie. If you loved Inspector Morse you will love this.  This is Inspector Morse before he became Inspector.  They do a great job as only the Brits know how.  Very well done. Love Midsomer.  It is usually very family friendly compared to most mysteries out there.  It has well developed characters and great mysteries.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoy Mysteries and the Brits do a great job of presenting them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1TU904JG5QQNY," I have been a big fan of this movie since it came out years ago. It is still one of the best Holmes movies made. The team of Christopher Plummer and James Mason are perfect as Holmes and Watson. The story is well written and the film deftly directed by the late Bob Clark who gives a good commentary on the dvd. This is a must have for Sherlock fans. Well done on all counts. Excellent B movie. The then reigning king of B,s David Carradine stars with a really stella cast. The story is filmed in New York and the use of real locations is a huge benefit to the visual style of the film. Shout Factory really did a beautiful job on this film and the commentary by Cohen is fun and informative. For the price you get a fun film with all the right ingredients to have solid entertainment. I forgot what a fun little movie this is. Great cast for a small budget horror film. William Shatner,The great Ida Lupino and Tom Skerritt just to name a few. Good direction and well used surroundings. This film is fun all around has gore and suspense and like I said wonderful cast. Robert Fuest does a fine job directing. Good transfer and sound. Highly recommend it to B horror fans. This episode from the 4th Doctors run is very important to collectors and just a great fun show overall. I think that Tom Baker is still the best of all the Doctors and I enjoy all of them. This dvd is full of great extras and the story itself is one of the best. Great fun for any Who fan! In this film James Garner does a great job in being the down on his luck, in the middle of it all detective Phillip Marlowe. he is the strength of this movie. The writing is good and has an outstanding cast of character actors. Carroll Oconnor, Gayle Hunnicutt, Sharynn Farrell, and Kenneth Tobey to name a few. If you collect mystery or detective films this is a great addition to your collection. I recommend this story and DVD to all Doctor Who fans. Very few stories still exist with Patrck Troughton as the 2nd Doctor. The story has the obvious cybermen in it but they are not the main villians,humans are,which is a nice twist well thought out. The effects are not up today's but that only adds to the charm. Since it is in black and white you really just end up enjoying a nostalgic reminder of 60's T.V. I love Karloff and have never seen him give a bad performance. That being said I recommend all fans grab this set as the Hang movies are worth every cent. Karloff holds these movies together and it all works through his presence. They are entertaining and I feel you can not go wrong with a karloff film. Robert Mitchum as Phillip Marlowe is excellent. The movie is a great evenings entertainment. Well done period movie with a good noir feel to the proceedings. I highly recommend this film to screen detective fans as I know they will not be disappointed. It has been a long time since this film has been available and this is a good copy at a good price. A little dated but still an excellent evenings viewing. Directed by M.Winner with an allstar cast of old and new. This film is worth watching just for Burgess Meridth's performance. The female lead is Christina Raines she is wooden but that actually adds to the film.(what ever becam of her?) Chris Sarandon in an early role does a good turn. If you like horror give this movie a chance and enjoy the chills! I really enjoyed this film. Lee gives one of his best performances. He is the main reason to get the film. He and Franco did a great job on this film. There is gratuitous sex but by this time in his career Franco would ussually stick in sex just to make the project more profitable and to help get distribution. Overall fun cinema and a good example of Eurohorror. Season two picks up where one ends. The series is chock full of action and intrigue. This is a great series and a wonderful set of characters. I own the whole series and I am into season three right after watching this season. I understand the ardent fans who follow the show and why, I believe that if you are into action and spy thrillers this show will entertain you. Great set of truly classic comedy. Groucho and gang can still make me laugh. And that is what timeless comedy does. If you have never seen the Marx Bros. Then you are in need of a comedy education the humor of a bygone era that still makes you laugh. I have owned this series for a while and still enjoy it after several viewings. It is thought provoking and well crafted. The show started in 1979 it did not get big budget and the special effects show it. The acting is well on par with the stories which are complex and off beat. If you enjoy Dr. Who with Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker you will enjoy this series. Jason Issac and cast do a wonderful job in this series. The story is timely and topical. The writing and directing are top notch. I watched all of it in one day the show is riveting. Anyone into espionage and or politcal thrillers will enjoy this series. Tom Baker was still getting his feet under him as the Doctor. He even fell and broke a collar bone filming it. The story is short but I enjoyed it. I think the commentary really makes this one more enjoyable. I recommend it for the low price and the fact that it is a fun dvd. Fun detective series at a great price. Lloyd Nolan stars as Shayne and brings the right combo of light hearted and toughness for this film version of the PI. I like these b series because they were the action comedies of their day and this set is excellent. Good transfer and a wonderful set of fun movies. If you like detective films and or into b movies this set is the way to go. I had never seen this episode until recently. Peter Davidson is one of my favorite Doctors. This is a much debated story and show. It is short but I found it complete. It reminded me of the old Hammaer and AIP tales of horror and intrigue. It is well worth the look and I must admit I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would. For somthing I puchased sight unseen it is solid entertainment. A good show.

For somthing I puchased sight unseen it is solid entertainment. A good show. I recommend this to anime fans and vampire fans. the story is the second part to the series Blood+. This is even more involved and character driven. Than the first season. The price for the whole season is at the lowest price I have seen todate at under $40.00 It is a great investment for the hours of entertainment to be seen. Definitely will do repeat viewings. I first caught an episode of this series on PBS Mystery years ago. I found it on dvd as a collection and had to have it. The show is engrossing and the actors do an excellent job of pulling you in and wanting more. Robeson Green is excellent and very believable as the lead. The whole show is exciting, intriguing and a satisfying set of stories that will hold up to repeat viewings. Great series Not your typical serial. The history of this twelve part adventure is that it was made with TV in mind so each episode is also a complete story but had the ability to do another adventure with the same story line in mind in other words no cliff hangers. It still plays well and Holdren is a solid Commander Cody in the lead. I like the Blue Ray transfer  and it still is an enjoyable afternoon romp. Good solid small Hammer horror film. I really enjoyed this movie. The ending was a little hard to accept but the rest was well done. I recommend this film to anyone into British and especially Hammer Horror. Good suspense and believable characters all the way around. BluRay has good sound and picture. At this price I recommend this set. The movies have been gone over with other reviews telling what they are about else where so I won't repeat but to say that they are not the best. The series does go down hill with each movie. But if you are like me and have the Matrix you just have to have the rest so you can marathon the series. This is a well done spy drama. The cast is perfect. Bill Nighy is the weary getting older spy who falls on to a document which could bring down the goverment. The story takes off from there with no one seeming to be who you would think. This was a great evenings entertainment and will be watched again by me. This film is easily one of the great action films in years. Karl Urban made a great Dredd he was comic book perfect for the role. The movie is all action and all you want is a Hero beating the Villans! Great stuff. And the pounding soundtrack only makes the movie better. If you want an all action flick. here it is! I picked this up for the grand kids and was surprised by how quickly they were hooked by it. The stories are in the vein of Scooby Do but tailored for the Archie bunch with a slight message thrown in every episode. They do not leave the kids 6 to 11 scared or bored. So in the long run for the price a great deal. This is a well done anime using the Marvel characters in a traditional story. i felt it works and is fun. The series all of which I have do a good job and are entertaining. I like the differencess in the anime take on the characters and it gives you a new perspective on the characters. The show is fun and I hope they do more in the future. I watched this anime with the subtitles and Japanese audio. I really ended up enjoying the new take on Iron Man. The story has a good arc story line and each episode is well written and animated. I feel that this series shows what can be done with a comic book character. The results are really surprisingly good. It is well done entertainment. The series will get repeat viewings I hope for more shows from this partnership. This show is one of my favorites. It just hits the right note with me. All of the actors do a fine job and the writers keep being inventive in the stories. Fun for everyone. If you have not tried Murdoch I recommend it highly. Fun crime show and well done stories make for a fine nights entertainment. Blu ray has nice picture and sound, Watched this the other day and really like Guy Pearce in the role. The episodes are ok, not great and need more character and less trying to build atmosphere. I hope the second season is better. Just bought and watched this latest Superman tale. Well done and with a solid interesting story. It has good character development and the conflicts are emotional as well as physical. The animation is really quite good and the figures are well designed. The back grounds are very well done but do not interfer with the characters. This is an excellent entry into the DC animation film series of Superman. I read a lot of complaints about this season. I know that they shook up the characters a bit and left some people feeling dismayed. I for one enjoyed the entire season and was fully entertained. The series is just splendid and well written the chemistry between the actors is fantastic. Once again I recommend the series and feel you will be well entertained. Good Stuff! This is the sequel to the series Blood C. I was not disappointed. The animation was good and the writing is spot on. Good way to spend the night. I hope they will be doing future entries in the series. i recommend all of the Blood last Vampire series and movies all are good and worth a look. Anyone who loves a good mystery show must catch these. Fun and excitement all the way. This season is more serious than the rest but still am evenings worth of fine entertainment. Good writing and well done acting still carry the day. Murdoch is one fine show and still entertaining after 6 seasons. This is a different kind of ghost story and it is a good effort. I got in to it but the pay off was not astounding. It is more like a good made for tv entry. The actors all do a compentent job. Breslin is in charge and the story pivots around her. She is a likable and believable character and that helps. This is one of the new idea ghost stories and definitely worth a look. This movie will end up a cult classic. A great story and wonderful acting bring you into a well told tale of man and machine. Any sci fi fan should take a look at this film and I do recommend the movie to Bladerunner fans. It is not the same but reminds me of the quality of character that Bladerunner evokes. I picked this up as a way of being able to use free shipping. Great deal I watched two of the movies and have no issue with the set. Good transfers and audio is fine. Good rainy day fun. Vampire lovers is a Hammer film. Peter Cushing and Douglas Wilmer both are in it. That alone makes it a fun  set to have. I found it a little slow in the beginning but stayed with it and wound up enjoying the series. What happens when evil infects your town has been done before. This is a good telling of just such a tale. The town has a good collection of characters and the series does hold your interest. The show is still fun but the mysteries are not as intriguing. The characters are not as quick on the uptake and this years arc turned out weak. Overall the actors are what kept you watching. The show is still the most pleasant and ejoyable who dunnit out there. I would like to see a return to the type of show it was in the begginning. Need to see more of this series. It is very involved and keeps you thinking. Good solid story with good graphics keeps pushing those enveloped on anime and what is kids and what is adult. This story and graphic violence is definitely for adults I would keep anyone under 15 away from it. If you are into Ghost in the Shell as I am this is must have. It is good and well worth having for those into the tv series of the same name. Here you get to see how everyone meets and Section is set up. Good entertainment and as ussual all complicated and over analyzed just as us fans suspect and want. Good fun 80's show. The series is a fine example of tv sci fi in the 80s and 90s. Connie Sellaca would go on to be the love interes to The Greatest American Hero. The rest of the cast went into the unknown. This is a DVR and is pricey for just 5 episodes. Bruce Timm is back. This tale takes place in an alternate universe. Superman, WonderWoman, and Batman are totally different than the ones your used to. Still an enjoyable way to pass 90 minutes. Bruce has a certain style and it is nice to see the man back in the saddle. I own all of the shows and movies and this fits nicely with the best. I was so skeptical about a sequel to the first series. How were they going to pull it off. Well they did. This series is as good as the first and I was riveted for the whole show. Tenant does an excellent job and the writing is spot on. Fans of the first series need to get in on this show wonderful entertainment. Another nice addition to the Batman animated family of movies. Good for both adults and kids. Watched with my grand children and everyone was entertained. Highly recommend it to both hard core fans and collectors. Entertaining and fun. It is a shame that this fun exciting film did not light up the box office. I enjoy it! The actors are well cast and Guy Ritchie does an excellent job of bringing the old show into the big screen. I recommend whole heartedly this fine evenings entertainment. Fun all theway! I( zombie is a really fun show. It has engaging characters and the stories are fun and original. The show was on for 13 episodes it's first year and the entire season is in this set. They were just hitting their stride when the season ended so I am really looking forward to season 2 This is a must own for fans of the show. Great fun and another excellent entry in the Sherlock Canon. If you are a fan of the show you will be thrilled with this take back to Victorian times for Benedict and Martin. Story moves well and folds nicely at the end into the current series. Great fun! I can not say enough good things about this series. As a fan of all things GitS. The newest series still carries viewer into the world started with Stand Alone Complex. Great show! Fans will be happy with the latest installment. Looking to more! Great entertainment. Really enjoy this DC animated story. The addition of Batwoman is an added treat. Really enjoy the action and story well done and time well spent viewing. DC really does a nice job on their animated tales and this is one of the better ones. This is a good telling of the famous Agatha Christie story. The characters are however not very likeable which kinda hurts the film. Yet enough is happening to give you a good evenings entertainment. The cast is topnotch and they are on top of their game so it is worth a look just to see them do what good actors do best. This story takes place after season 3. But like all of Black Butler I found this very well done and all around worthy to add to my growing anime collection. The story is fun and intelligent with a surprise guest in the mix. I really enjoy all of the series and will be giving this one repeated viewings like he rest. Beautifully done show. Love the show. Better restoration would have been nice but it is still worth the price to have Filmation's Tarzan. Good stuff and not a series that you worry about for being too violent.  I watch this with my youngest grandson and not a worry from his mom my daughter. Some Filmation fans will despair the tracking lines but most will look beyond the glitches and enjoy the best Tarzan of the of the 70's Murdoch is back and boy did I miss him. It has been a while between seasons but the show still drags me in. I really enjoy the show for it's well written scripts and excellent acting. The show has interesting crimes and some of the wittiest dialog of any show on TV. Yannick Bisson and cast bring a flair to the show that really makes you want to see more of them. This is one way to own some Italian Zombie horrors. The movies are uneven on quality but the price more than makes up for it. Good way to own and see some classic zombie action from our friends in Europe. Robert Vaughn how ever is not in any of the movies that I saw. This series is based on the films featuring the Crime genius Dr. Mabuse. The films appear edited but do deliver the flavor of 60s Euromovies. The actors are all well represented in these films. I got this set at a very low price and picked it up because I wanted to see the ones with Lex Barker. I saw all of them and enjoyed them all enough to be looking at the others and learning more about Mabuse. Good not great made for TV movie. Curtis Harrington directed movie just for the check and admits it in extra. Paid low so worth it to me I like Harrington and Crenna. Short but fun! Good story and lots of action keep you watching this series and it is short so bingeing is easy. There is plenty of blood and gore along the way and the story is full of twists and turns. One reviewer wrote that it reminded them of a character from Black Lagoon I concur.. Good Stuff This series is a great Danish noir. The show has three stories and each one is riveting. The show is in subtitles for us who speak English. It has wonderful characters and is different than the USA version of the show. I own both and enjoy them. Strong female lead played by a wonderful talented actress. Good writing! What more does a mystery thrill fan need. RUN OUT AND SEE THIS. Great set of Swedish Noir. I enjoy this character and her adventures. Very well done. You have subtitles but if you are like me and are not bothered you will find this to be a fine nights entertainment. The lead is a reporter and very well played here. The stories are well written and move along at a good pace. This movie is the only real slasher film in Cushings filmography. How the producers got the star along with Sue Lloyd to appear in it was and is an astounding achievement. This blueray has a wonderful transfer and great extras. Cushing fans can collect this and enjoy it. Peter gives as always a wonderful performance. The film it self was much better than I was expecting and the commentary track was informative and fun. Great Nordic thriller. All three stories are gripping and exciting good stuff all around. Will not give out stories as it would involve spoilers. Just enjoyed them so much I am going to invest in the TV show. Be warned it is in Swedish with subtitles. Rare to see such a cast in a made for tv movie. Moore and company make a very enjoyable Sherlock pastiche. Just remember this is Moore not Brett and sit back and have some fun with the A listers doing a fine job in  entertaining you for 90 minutes. Good stuff and John Huston makes a great Moriarty. A good time filler. This low budget film gets the job done. The story is solid if a little drawn out. The documentary style is good but does not help pacing. Overall the film is a good effort and I watched the whole movie. Great combo of Wallace thrillers. Afternoon fun! The great Christopher Lee and Klaus Kinski make for enjoyable romp in 60s crime drama. The transfers are good but not blemish free. But at under $20 this is a great bargain for collectors of what I call Saturday Matinee thrillers. Fun way to spend a rainy afternoon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A3BQ84G90BRVSG," I really can't say much about this DVD.  However it was shipped in good condition and on time.  This was purchased to a family member.  She was surprised to get it and thoroughly liked the movie. always loved the ""old time"" cartoon characters...not those of these days.  I also love Christmas and putting them both together was a  fun thing for me..Yes, I am a grandmother, but I still love cartoons.  This was sent to me on time, good condition and I was very pleased with the outcome.. I had seen this movie many years back and thought I might want to see it again.

I would certainly recommend this seller again Good actors, perfect plot to the movie.  Suspensful, yet delightful with the story to go with it.

I would certainly recommend this seller again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3Q4XAQXKKV6V," They are clearly gouging by not offering the final 2 seasons separately. There is NO excuse not to. It's no secret people are hungry for the final 2 seasons, we have been waiting for 6-7 years and it's clearly documented. They are just taking advantage. The characters are practically all uninteresting. The plot is so tired. The ''best'' part of the movie is Foster merely opening a bathroom vent and then having access to all vital plane wiring. Yeah, that's going to happen. If it did all our planes would have crashed by now. Nothing about this movie rings even close to being true-to-life; avoid. Is this movie TRULY $30?! HA! Glad I borrowed it... Some people are commenting on the 30th Ann. edition and their comments are spilling out onto this version. Make no mistake this IS the version to own. I don't own it yet, but I do know this DOES NOT contain the extra footage.  The reshot stuff on the 30th edition is to be AVOIDED. The new theme song  sounds a bit like Creepshow. What IS all the hype about? Just because this show isn't as disasterous as ""UPN"" or ""WB"" slop doesn't mean it's great television. Is it fast? Uh-huh. Is it good? Not really. How quickly some forget about the great TV shows, luckily you can currently pick up DVD sets like the Rockford Files, Columbo, and Quincy. Or put your 24 dollars towards Starsky and Hutch... those were the days, when CHARACTERS mattered, not fast camera work. A movie this limp and nonessential gets THIS type of ""star"" treatment? You can stuff a huge box with as many discs and extras as you want but it doesn't make the movie any better. I Am Legend is simply ""meh"" no matter what type of spiffy box art is designed for it. Definite PASS on this one. Hilarious. You get less content for roughly the same price as the entire ""first"" first set. Yea, ok, sure. If the Outer Limits were a comedy I could at least say this is ironic, but for now I'll stick with MORONIC. Wow. To think how much footage is missing compared to the directors cuts is ONE thing -- but then to KNOW down the line they are going to make fans REBUY the movies once they put out the directors cut is beyond an insult. I have heard talk on random websites how many one stars this series is getting and believe me, we are making waves -- I am not buying until I get the FULL films. There is nothing that can be said about this show to reveal how awful it is. This show represents the beginning of a new era in television that falls into the ""unwatchable"" category. Full House is Small Wonder without the robot maid. I will pay easily $50 each to have the remaining 2 seasons. If the numbers in terms of volume isn't enough for you Fox to make a profit DOUBLE the price and cut production, we will still buy this, we loyal fans. Same goes for Green Acres. PLEASE FOX WE LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For someone like me who enjoys the Zorro movies and the Tomb Raider movies, I have to say... 10,000 BC is just pathetic. Unlikeable characters, terribly inconsistent accents, lame script, GOD AWFUL acting... it's all here. True the effects are good but this viewer needs more. This script needs about 10,000 more years to evolve into something watchable. I will pay easily $50 each to have the remaining 2 seasons.

I have no idea how the title can say with any conscience - ""complete"" unless it means ""complete..ly mangled"" or ""complete waste of money"". No thanks I will wait for the UNEDITED versions to come out if they ever do. These are NOT remastered, and these are NOT uncut. Humor fell flat more than it worked..the soundtrack I don't think really fit/melded as expected..second rate 5th element costumes were lousy when not distracting..decent post production effects but there just wasn't much for me to like here - the cast included.  Thumbs down from me -- add it to the Frozen/LEGO movie hysteria.. This just felt like a huge budgeted FOX kids Saturday morning show.

And once again the day is saved by a millennial...sigh.  Relax, I always seem to dislike all these movies that everyone else is whipped into a frenzy over.. Frozen also.  If you want to see a decent movie check out Love and Mercy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A10FBJXMQPI0LL," In the bold tradition of The Avengers, this movie tends to wind it's way around and about several story lines and a dozen characters.  If you've ever seen an episode and liked it, you will LOVE this modern re-telling!  Not for movie critics or whiny  why-doesn't-every-little-thing-make-sense'ers. . .  Not stop action and  wit! Rent it. . . Buy it. . . Do what you have to do to see this movie at least once.  Really weel done with more surealism than I've ever been able to sit through! Truly worth your time!

That's all I've got for you. That it didn't appeal to the minority of ""Ahnold-shoot-em-up-blow-wm-up"" fans is no real loss. It's a good movie that sort of ""wraps up"" without ""ending"" the story. Don't look for all the heroes to ride off into the sunset, and don't look for geeky, campy one-liners.  This is actually the more cerebral of the movies to date. Bueno. Insomuch as the movie was not designed to be a historical account of what happened during this period in Japan, rather an interesting, beautiful work of fiction in the form of a movie, I liked it. ""Dances With Wolves"" in Japan?  Definately. Amazing film making?  Umm, yeah, okay. Terrific scenery and costumes?  Oooooh yeaaaaaah. I'm *not* a Tom Cruise fan, but I *did* like this movie.

A2W4VLO3ED2Y4X," Steed and Emma Peel.  Who could ask for more.  The elaborate and twisted plots as always are foiled by the debonaire Stted and always beatufil Emma Peel.  Wathced this as a child.  Enjoyed watching the episodes again.  A definate addition to my library. I enjoy military history.  This battle too place sgortly after the British lost an entire column against the Zulus at Islandwana.  This isolated post faced even greater odds with fewer soldiers.  I enjoyed reading about he success, watching was even more enjoyable. There are two DVDs in the set, labelled 1 and 2. Both DVDs have the same content, discussion about the episode, but there is now way to actually SEE the episode.  Botht DVD are filled with commentary. Both are superb actors. Combining them into this story of two ex military in the colony of India, hoping to make their fortune in the wilds of India is the makings of an excellent movie.  The actors and plot do not disappoint! And for an American, the accents only add to the exotic nature of the story. As always, the quirky adventures of Steed and Emma Peel entertain. (And who does NOT like Emma Peel?) This is a definite addition to your collection. The supporting cast in each episode typically has faces that will have you wondering, ""Where did I see him (or her) before?"" As always the adventures of the duo Steed and Emma Peel are quirky. But who could NOT like Emma Peel? Not only are the adventures fun to watch, it is also fun to see the different villains and supporting cast and think, ""Where did I see him before?"" This set does not disappoint. A worthwhile addition to your collection. I used to enjoy this show, but never saw the pilot.  I enjoy watching it now and enjoy it more having watched the pilot and first few episodes. It puts a lot of the laters episodes into context. I love the Britcoms and having seen bits and pieces of the servies on TV, had to get the DVD.  Definately worth it.  Penelope Keith is a down on her luck upper-crust Brit living on her former estate under reduced circumstances.  She definately demonstrates upper-crust does not equate to clueless as she deftly and with class slips the dagger into her tormenter. Watched and enjoyed this series years ago. (Who would NOT enjoy watching Victoria Pratt?). Never saw the initial episodes which set up the plot lines.  Good series.  I am enjoying the DVDs more than I enjoyed the original series because now I can watch when I want to. Never saw this series on TV.  Glad I saw the DVD and purchased.  Mulberry shows up as does an unusual stanger and Mulberry integrates himself into the houshold of an older woman.  The plot is twisted enough to keep you watching as each episode takes you closer to the ending.  It is humorous and engaging at the same time. I am glad I purchased this series. I will be watching again and again. Watched as a child.  Still have the theme song on my iPod.  I enjoy enjoying again the various "" night of the. . . "" plots and the evil characters like Loveless. In the tradition of Britcoms, this DVD has an outlandish premise backed by schoolgirls with English accents. The combination is one I will watch again and again. I had heard reference to St Trinian's girls on another Britcom and had to see what the concept entailed. I learned of the DVDs and had to purchase and watch them.

I had heard reference to St Trinian's girls on another Britcom and had to see what the concept entailed. I learned of the DVDs and had to purchase and watch them. The premise - an innocuous machiine used for nefarious purposes, while not new to us, would have been relatively novel when presented originally.  There are a limited number of the Hartnell years available, making each one a pleasure to own and watch.  I had never seen the episode, having come into Who fandom late in life.  Was particularly looking for the earlier episodes to add to my collection, This storyline does not disappoint. I do not know how they did it.  They took a simple theme, the social cluelessness of the IT staff along with the technical ineptitude of IT management and ran for 4 seasons with new and humorous situations.  Moss, Roy and Jen are hilarious. I do not know how they did it.  They took a simple theme, the social cluelessness of the IT staff along with the technical ineptitude of IT management and ran for 4 seasons with new and humorous situations.  Moss, Roy and Jen are hilarious. Love the series.  While the US version is OK, the UK version is the one I saw first and I like the characters (except Annie - I love her!)  I mean really, a Vampire, werewolf and ghost with English accents!  The fact it has a neat plotline also helps.  I grabbed and viewed the episodes as fast as possible on iTunes and grabbed the DVDs to watch whenever I want. Definately a different look at Lincoln and History.  If you like all things vampires, this one is for you.  While based on the book, obviously, to fit on a screen there are some differences and abridgements. Loved the series as a child.  Now I can watch when I want and even temporarily return to those carefree Saturday mornings of my youth.  Underdog was a typical Saturday Morning cartoon.  Good guys were good guys and bad guys were bad.  The hero protected those who could not defend themselves. Entertainment and a message at the same time. Saw the movie in the Theaters, twice.  Had to get a copy when they came out.  One of the bettwe dystopian future movies.  While for time and format, thy had to make changes, the movie stays very close to the storyline.  Cannot wait for book 2! (Which I will also snag a personal copy of - legally!) The premise is an extended power outage in the US. The story follows several individuals as they cope with the outage in different ways. Given the real examples of outages in the North East, I think their timeline for rioting to begin is optimistic. Otherwise, I feel the portrayals are fairly accurate. I heard about the Nat Geo special and tracked down when it would be running again. After watching, I had to get the DVD. Two individuals make a suicide pact. The individual who will assist, meets the family of the proposed 'victim'. Gemma Arterton (St Trinians) and Mackenzie Crook (Pirates of the Caribbean) make this film (Although Colm Meaney (Star Trek Next Generation) preforms brilliantly). Despite the rather gruesome plot, the storyline has a happy outcome. Saw the miniseries on TV. . . Interesting plot and plot twist. . . It keeps you guessing all the way till the end. Tricia Helfer being in it was an added bonus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A35IK5PV6GLP31," I really enjoyed the first and third episodes.  The middle episode looked too corny right from the start, so I skipped it. A mixed bag, but consider it if you can get it at a decent price.  I don't know why Avengers DVDs are so expensive! This is an excellent movie.  I just watched it and really enjoyed it.  It is the kind of family movie that they just don't make anymore.  This is one of those classics that really should be in your collection. This movie will not be everyone's cup of tea, and if you are looking for excitement, you won't find it here, but this is a movie that I enjoy watching over and over.  It is a great de-stressing feel-better movie.  It is the closest thing I know of to a relaxing vacation at the seashore.  The location, characters, and comedy all combine to make it an excellent movie. This is excellent and I enjoyed it very much.  I would also recommend ""Three Days of the Condor,""  ""The Day of the Jackal,"" ""Counterfeit Traitor,"" ""Where Eagles Dare"" and ""The 49th Parallel."" The picture quality was great. The negative reviews are from about 5 years ago, so it looks like the current DVDs are better. The movie was better than I expected. I was expecting a so-so movie since it is not that well known, but thought that it was really good. Great story and great acting.  It is a mystery to me why this movie isn't better known.  If you like WWII movies, this is a must. This is an older Cary Grant movie that I had never seen.  I agree with the reviewer who said that if you like old movies and Cary Grant, you should watch this one. It is from the '30s, I think, so the picture quality and sound are not great.  The price is right and it is worth watching. My wife loved the show when it was on, so she was delighted when I found this DVD set for her.  They travel around Great Britain on a Norton motorcycle and sidecar fixing meals for groups of people ranging from football clubs to priests, using fresh ingredients and lots of cream and butter. I was delighted that this became available, especially at such a reasonable price.  Get one while they are available!  Some DVD sets that I have purchased at a reasonable price, like The Saint Early Episodes and The Saint Megaset, have gone way up in price since I bought them for reasons that I don't understand.  I don't know if that will happen with this, but this is a must if you are an Avengers fan. This show never gets old.  It was the first sit-com, and few have come close to being as good as this is.  I am glad to have them on DVD now. I was delighted that this became available, especially at such a reasonable price.  Get one while they are available!

I don't know if that will happen with this, but this is a must if you are an Avengers fan. Lots of fun to watch.  I am glad that I made this purchase.  The price is reasonable.  It also has commentary by Robert Conrad, which is interesting.  He gives an introduction to the episodes, telling something about them. This is an enjoyable World War II mini series about a bomb disposal unit in London.  I watched it when it was on PBS in the '80s and have enjoyed seeing it again.  Money well-spent. I used to watch these on Saturday afternoons as a kid.  Some things aren't as enjoyable as they were when you were a kid, but this is.  You should treat yourself and get this. The first season is pretty good, but this show got better with seasons two and three.  This show is as good as you remember.  If you are too young to remember it, you have something to look forward to.  Good, clean fun.  I am so glad that these are available.  If you like this, I would also recommend the Ma and Pa Kettle movies. I have a lot of DVDs of old TV shows, and I have enjoyed this one more than most.  A very worth-while purchase.  I am looking forward to season three.  Jeepers, just get it! These are four great movies at a great price.  Any one of them would be worth the price.  They are double-sided DVDs, but so what?  All four are top-notch WWII movies. This is good, but not great movie.  Worth watching once.  I probably won't want to watch it again for a long time.  It is the type of movie better gotten from Netflix or iTunes than purchasing the DVD, but it is cheap enough, so you might consider getting it for those times when you want some light entertainment.  It is not at the same level as 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, but is still worth a viewing. Not bad, but get TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: World War II - Battlefront Europe (Kelly's Heroes / Where Eagles Dare / The Dirty Dozen / Battleground) (2009)instead.  For the price, it is still a bargain, but I don't think any of the movies are outstanding except for Gunga Din. If you like Gunga Din, get this and consider the other movies as a bonus. I wasn't too impressed by this one.  Not bad entertainment, but not great either.  The story was ok and the cgi predictable  You are not missing a lot if you skip this one. I wondered if it would be worth the higher than usual price for the DVD.  I think that it was.  If you are a Cary Grant and/or Doris Day fan, then this is worth considering.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2AQ89MAIB0ER4," I have watched The Avengers since it ran in the 60s.  I've also recorded as many Avengers episodes from A&E and other sites on VHS as I can.  This disc set is great!  Even though I have watched this series for years, there were at least 2-3 episodes I don't remember ever seeing PLUS the rest of the disc set are classics.  This set is a must buy for Emma Peel fans, her first year, and Avengers fans. One of the all time greats about WWII, the Army Air Corps and leadership.  The Air Force and Army used this film to show the strains and stress of leadership.  I have served in both the Air Force and Army and how watched this so many times.  It is always great to view.  Today we have no idea of the risks of the WWII fighter and bomber crews.  This film begins to show a realistic view of the situation. This is a good movie.  It does not have a surprise ending but it was overall good.  Often I'll watch a movie is segments ( a little here, a little there) but this one I watched at one sitting. I saw this movie years ago at the theater and wanted to view it again.  I really don't like Sci-fi but really enjoyed this one probably because it is a tough cop movie that just happens to take place in outer space.  Of course it doesn't hurt to have Sean Connery.  I must say the ""futuristic"" computer graphics are comical. I loved the ""Peter Gunn"" series.  This movie was not as good.  I missed all of the old actors playing their roles.  How can you beat Lola Albright as Edie Hart?  The jazz also didn't seem to be as prominent as it is in the series. The storyline was OK.  Of course, Craig Stevens had to be Peter Gunn. We all loved them in the Thin Man series but each of these movies with William Powell and Myrna Loy are just as good although all aren't comedies and  therefore they aren't as funny as they are as Nick and Nora Charles. One of my all time favorite dramas.  Great cast and I love the principle of math solves many things, including crime.  The personal dynamics within the show are interesting.  There's romance, family dynamics, peers at work both at the FBI and university.  I wish it had lasted 20 years.  I saw every episode and now have every episode on DVD. Finally!  I am so glad ""Designing Women"" is finally out on DVD.  As soon as it arrived I watched the entire season.  Prior to this series, I have only watched random syndicated shows.  I love watching any series from start to finish.  The is superb.  The additional interview was great and filled in some of the history of the development of the series and how the individuals characters developed.  I can't wait for Season 2 SOON! I love the old 60s Westerns and I remember this one.  I had bought some of this series that are one 2 or 3 discs.  When the entire series came out I just had to have it! I was so looking froward to this DVD set (2 dsics).  However, neither disc played on tow different players.  I really wish trhey would have worked but I was at least given a refund. I am in the American military and discovered Caro Emerald here on the local German radio.  I love her jazz style and her songs.  Her material is so good and sounds just like old Jazz standards, even though they are not. This is a good mystery thriller.  It was listed as Horror but I found it to be more of a thriller.  Let's face it, I bought it to see a young Stephanie Powers and she did a good job.  This is a movie to watch even if Stephanie Powers wasn't in it.  It does have a somewhat of a surprise ending too. I have tried to see all Myrna Loy movies.  This one is OK.  The film is short, even for the day.  Myrna plays as Asian, which she has done before.  The plot is OK.  Typical story of getting revenge.  Myrna has not hit her stride as Nora Charles (The Thin Man series), which is two years in her future. This is the greatest combat series made.  It is the story a a squad and their encounters.  There is always an ethical dilemma for the Soldiers and Sergeant Saunders to deal with.  I watched the show every week in the 60s and have watched almost all of the series on DVD.  I also have watched every other series since then and none is better than this series.

A2K5ZAGWF99VBK," A very enjoyable movie. I have watched this movie on public access TV and when I discovered it on DVD I went ahead and got it again and watched it. Now that it is in my library of DVDs. I can pull it down and watch it any time I want to. My granddaughters and I enjoyed watching this movie very much. I enjoy reading the book to them. And I have to explain to them the difference between the movie and the book and why they're not the same. I enjoyed watching Ben Hur when I was a kid. And having it on DVD makes it easy to pull it up and watch it again and again. When there are cold rainy nights and I'm interested in a little bit a history and a little bit of fiction. American pie unedited is a sexy romp. That any adult or older teen will enjoy. I enjoyed it very much. Something good to watch late at night. When I'm all alone. I saw twister in the movie theater and was paranoid for a whole summer. But I enjoyed watching the movie. Anytime we would have hail or the sky would go green I would be waiting for the twister to come. So to have that thrill again when this movie came out on DVD I just had to get it. A very enjoyable movie except for the end. But because they are telling a true story about a real game little mare. They couldn't gloss over what happened to her in the end. But it is still an excellent movie . The Bourne trilogy in one package. That way you don't have to dig up all of the movies in their individual packaging. It's all there in one you can set down and have a whole evening and enjoy watching the whole series . The Bourne trilogy in one package. That way you don't have to dig up all of the movies in their individual packaging. It's all there in one you can set down and have a whole evening and enjoy watching the whole series if you like watching Wolverine movies. This is one in the series. It answers questions that you may not have thought about asking and leaves other questions to be answered, and hopefully other movies that will come about Wolverine sanctuary is the kind of place a lot of people would like to be. There always interesting things happening. And noise things to do. I can get wrapped up in the story very easily. I enjoyed watching this very much, and figuring out the story along with Sherlock Holmes. It had enough twists to keep me guessing right up till the end. Hopefully in the future they will make more movies like this American reunion answers questions about what happened to all of these characters. Silly glimpse into adulthood after high school. It makes you wonder about your world. And what you would do in their situation. this was a movie. The Me on the edge of my seat from the moment I started watching it until it ended and made me look forward to the next movie in the series I thought these were for interesting movies. I seem to of them in the theater when I was a kid. And so when I seen them on DVD I decided to get it and watch it again it has many interesting twists and turns that I very much enjoyed. And I look forward to seeing more as the years go along hopefully this series will not get canceled. this movie stood on its own, but it was a good addition to the series also I enjoyed it very much and I would recommend it to anyone who likes watching the Ironman movies Percy Jackson and the city of monsters is a good second movie in the series. It's a movie that I enjoyed watching very much when it was released in the theaters , and I will very much enjoy watching it on DVD when I received this in the mail I enjoyed this movie very much in the theater when I went to see it, and I was very happy when I got this DVD quality is just as good as empathy aider and I really enjoyed the storyline I enjoyed this movie very much. At the time this movie was based on I was not even a twinkle in my father's I. It is a piece of history that no one should ignore or forget.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A203GFDF90DSWD," I rented and watched all the Jane Eyre movies to see which one I liked best.  I believe they are all good and you really can't go wrong but this is my favorite.  Highly recommend if you like Jane Eyre. This is one of the greatest all time movies.  WE highly recommend it.  It is hilarious.  Julie Andrews is great at impersonating a man impersonating a woman and Robert Preston is great and funny. I'd be surprised if there is someone who hasn't see this movie, but we highly recommend it.  It is funny, cute and sometimes you'll have tears but they turn into laughs. One you have to see. Never saw it so decided I should see what the hoopla is all about.  I didn't like it.  I wouldn't recommend it. It's dark.  Some think it's funny, cute - not. Just my opinion. This is a great older movie.  We love having this in our movie library.  Kinda scary in parts for younger kids so use discretion.  Highly recommend for older kids and adults. Highly recommend.  Unique twist on communication through time.  Very good movie, keeps your attention.  We love this movie and would recommend it to all ages.  I love how it all works out. We bought this for our daughter to learn and teach her son.

Her son 5) loves to use his hands and wanted to learn this and she wanted to also just to know it.  Highly recommend. I love these movies, but....They stop at movie 7 with the Antichrist alive and well.  If they're going to do a set of books to movies, they should at least plan to go all the way through. Or at the very least do the few movies they do finishing thru the end not the middle.  I will not watch these again.  If they continued on the the end of the Antichrist I would definitely watch. We have 22 sets and will be purchasing the 23 set soon.  We love this show and highly recommend.  Regularly have a Midsomer Murders marathon, takes several days which we love. We enjoy all the Harry Potter movies.  I watch them all the time.  I highly recommend them but I would only let little kids 7-8 and under maybe watch only the 1st 2.  They get scarier with each successive movie.  But I love them all.  Parental guidance is suggested. We enjoy all the Harry Potter movies.  I watch them all the time.

We regulary have a Midsomer Murders marathon and almost have withdrawals when we finish.  Highly recommend. We highly recommend this to all ages.  We grew up as kids watching Zorro on tv after school.  So nice to have them all, commercial free to watch all the time. We love this movie.  We highly recommend it to all ages for the holidays, or anytime of the year actually. You can't go wrong with Henry Winkler and he is great in this movie. Love this show.  Have all seasons, wish there were mroe.  The case that holds each CD is made rather cheaply, they don't stay but I use paper towel to protect them inside case.  But I would buy it again anyway. Highly recommend.  Our grandson loved getting this along with the Discovery Esssential Dinosaur Pack and the When Dinosaurs Ruled.  He watches all of them and even our son said they were really entertaining and well done. We highly recommend this show.  It's entertaining and clean.  We have 22 sets and will be purchasing the newest set released #23. Can't wait.  We watch them regularly as a marathon and seem to miss it when we finish with them all. Great movies.

Fun to have a Midsomer Murders marathon that lasts several days. This was a very good movie.  But there is one scene where a homeless man talking to her says God's name in vane.  Wish that hadn't happened, it didn't need to be there for a family Christmas movie.  Other than that it was a good movie.  So you need to decide. Great movies.

This was the only way we could find the Naughty or Nice Christmas movie.  But that's ok, we really wanted the Wishing Tree too.  These 2 movies were well done and great family movies.  The other 2 were pretty good, we would watch them again.  Hightly recommend this pack for the family. Great movies.  We have all the Lord of the Rings and now have all the Hobbits.

The is one of the best movies ever made.  It keeps you engaged throughout as you try to figure out what's going to happen next and how do the many characters fit in. This is the absolute worst movie I've ever watched.  There is no simarility between the original Beauty and the Beast and this movie.  There's no plot and a lot of unnecessary sex and nudity.  I didn't even finish watching it.  This movie will go into the garbage. This is one of my favorite movies.  What are the chances that these two people should meet and development a relationship.  The chemistry between the two is so dynamic, you're constantly cheering them on throughout the movie.  I loved the way she finds out he didn't marry -- through the book he had written.

Four great mysteries -  subtitles provided. This is one of my favorite movies.  A movies that's totally impossible to ever come true in the real world, but on film anything is possible.  Olivia Newton-John was the perfect choice for a mannequin to become real.  Granted, parts of the movie are silly, but that's what's makes you laugh at the silliness of it. Takes you into other peoples' world, their dreams and their fantasies.  There are twists and turns throughout the movies and eventually everything works out and I love happy endings.  I feel good when I watch these kinds of movies. I remember seeing these movies on TV when it was Womens Entainment and I enjoyed them at that time.  I bought them because I wanted them for my collection.  They're still as good as they were when first viewed on television.  Of course anything with conflict, sex, and a happy ending is my kind of movie. I love movies where I can excape into their worlds and imagine what it's like to live a different kind of life, and I said before with my other reviews, I love happy endings. I love IL Divo.

After suffering a family tragedy, social worker, Patty Addison (Madelene Stowe) throws herself into her work finding homes for children in need.  With her marriage in trouble, Patty feels it's the worst time to foster a child (Emily) herself.  However, Emily's love and loyalty quickly win over the strained couple.  Patty faces the ultimate test in faith, and love is the only common bond a family really needs. I love sappy Christmas movies, and this one is no exception.  The storyline is pretty predictable, and as usual has a happy ending.  If you're looking for award-winning acting, then I'm afraid you'll be disappointment.  This is just a feel good movie where you find yourself rooting for the couple to live happily ever after. It's a cute movie, but very predictable.  Emma Caulfield agrees to participate in a ""reality"" show  to date and maybe marry Jason Priestley.  However, she really is drawn to Bradley Cooper, who plays Jason's manager.  Typical dilemma -- who will Emma choose? This is a okay version of Jane Eyre.  I didn't find the actor and actress very convincing in their roles.  There are too many other versions that are much better so I wouldn't waste your money on this one. This is a great series, but you have to like James Nesbitt.  He's great in this role of an undercover cop from Ireland.  He has a very dry sense of humor.  Some episodes are pretty dark, but for the most part the issues covered are relevant to today.  Sometimes it's hard to understand the accents -- thank goodness for subtitles. I love sappy Christmas movies, and this one is no exception.

Michael Shanks, Susan's son's counselor, steals the movie. I love any kind of Christmas movie.  They're silly in places, funny in others, and sometimes sad, but there is always a message attached to the movie -- a sort of lesson to learn, or something you may have forgotten.  People change in Christmas movies.  It's unfortunate that doesn't always happen in ""real life.""  Keep making movies that make you heart happy.

Christmas is right around the corner and Jules Daly (Katie McGrath) is doing her best to create a loving home for her niece and nephew.  Then she loses her job, but all is not lost because a mysterious and unexpected invitation arrives inviting them to spend Christmas with their grandfather who's the Duke of Castlebury.  This movie is about an enchanting romance, and the unbreakable bonds of family.  This inspirational tale will become a new holiday tradition. Another great season.  Jake Doyle is back for another hilarious and action-packed season, but this time he's a member of the Newfoundland Royal Constabulary.  Mal, Rose, And Des are back also.  While the three continue being private investigators, Jake is assigned to protect a mob informant turned federal witness.  Leslie is also back, but a relationship between Jake and Leslie is a long shot. An all star cast finds fantasy, action, romance and adventure when Prince Wendell travels through the portal to a mythical kingdom of Manhattan and finds two ordinary mortals.  Together they battle the evils of the parallel universe.  Great for all ages -- highly entertaining. Any Christmas movies is worth owning.  This set has 6 really great Christmas movies.  I like the protective ""can-like"" packaging.  It's a terrific gift for any age.  The only thing I don't like about owning your own Christmas DVDs is that very few have closed captioning.  Sometimes it's difficult for me to make out all of the words.  I even have an hearing aid and I still have difficulty sometimes. I love sappy Christmas movies, and this one is no exception.

Everyone's favorite PI family is back for another season of cases, crime and personal complications that make life in Newfoundland quite interesting.  All the same people are back:  Mal, Rose, Des, Leslie, and Tinny.  Some surprises are in store for you concerning Tinny and Jake and Leslie.  Buy the series to find out.  My on,y complaint is that now I have to wait for a Season 5, and I wish there was closed captioning. I love sappy Christmas movies, and this one is no exception.  The storyline is pretty predictable, and as usual has a happy ending.  If you're looking for award-winning acting, then I'm afraid you'll be disappointment.  This is just a feel good movie where you find yourself rooting for the couple to live happily ever after. This says Vera, Set 3, but the DVD is Gently George.  If you like the police drama during the 1960s in England, then this series is great.  There's no bloodshed.  Sometimes the accents are difficult to understand.  Fortunately, there are subtitles. I've always liked Kenneth Moore, so when I saw this series I thought ""why not?""  Big mistake!!  The quality of picture is very bad and the audio is much worse.  There's no closed captioning so it's very hard to understand.  Additionally, my copy kept skipping and freezing up, so I returned it.  Perhaps if it's ever remastered and closed captioning is added, I'll try again. Portuguese actor, Diogo Morgado delivers a spectacular portrayal of Jesus.  This powerful and inspirational feature film depicts the life of Christ from His humble birth through His teachings, crucifixion and ultimate resurrection. This is the story of four young men from the wrong side of the tracks in New Jersey who came together to form the rock group Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons.  This movie portrays their trials and triumphs, as well as the outstanding music that influenced an entire generation.  The music steals the show.  The acting is just okay. Great movie.  A cynical TV exec looks at the perfect town inside a Christmas globe and rants about how the holiday movies she produces are as fake as the ornament.  She throws it to the ground and it bounces back hitting her on the head knocking her out.  When she awakens, she's in the perfect snow-covered town depicted in the snow globe and married with two children.  A delight to watch. I love sappy Christmas movies, and this one is no exception.

This is just a feel good movie where you find yourself rooting for the couple to live happily ever after. Entertaining Christmas movie.  To Jack Carter (C. Thomas Howell), family is everything, but his family is drifting apart. To bring the closer together, Jack decides that this Christmas it's time to take the family on a much needed vacation.  Off they go to a social-media-free cabin in Farthering Pines.  What happens next is extremely funny and well worth watching. British combat nurse, Claire Randall is reunited with her husband after WWII. While on her second honeymoon, Claire is transported back to 1743 Scotland by forces she cannot understand. Claire is captured and accused of being a spy.  Forced by circumstances to marry an outlawed Highlander, Claire finds herself falling in love and torn by her loyalities to two men in vastly different times.

This project is Region 2 which means it wouldn't play on my machine.  In other words I didn't get a chance to watch it.  However, I have seen it before and know the story. I love Mary Higgins Clark books, and ordinarily I love the movies.  However, this particular movie was boring and the acting was mediocre.  Additionally, because there is no ""closed captioning"" it's very difficult to hear -- too many soft voices.  If I were you, I'd stick to the book. I really like Hugh Jackman, but this movie was extremely boring.  I had a very hard time understanding the dialog, and with no closed captioning, I missed a lot of the dialog.  There's not much of a plot and the acting is very amateurish.  I'd recommend you save your money. I like the movie fine otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it.  However, whoever or whatever company converted this from VHS to DVD did a lousy job.  I know the movies is old, but you can't understand the audio -- it's so bad and the quality of the picture is terrible.  I'm sorry I bought it. This movie is good, but somewhat predictable.  There's no closed captioning and the dialogue is sometimes difficult to understand.  It's supposed to be a thriller, but you catch on quickly.  The ending is a surprise. I like Danny Kaye, but this DVD, Christmas with Danny Kaye, was very disappointing.  Although the show are episodes from his 1963 and 1966 Christmas shows featuring Nat King Cole, Mary Tyler Moore, Peggy Lee, and Wayne Newton, it was really boring and not very funny.  I wouldn't waste money or time on this DVD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2YHLBUF1OTDNN," This version is the 3rd that I have found to have fallen short of the mark.  This one is more likeable of the 3, but still not the best.    Ciaran Hinds does his best, but it's his delivery.  Any way, it's not one that I want to add to my Jane Eyre collection.    I can, however, recommend the Timothy Dalton 1983 Version as well as the Toby Stevens 2006 Version. They are fabulous! The 2008 BBC version goes into more detail and I like it more. But this is still a good version too. The Movie it's self has NO CONs What-so-ever and has wonderful music in it. I highly recomend it to anyone looking for a clean movie to watch! Very funny Christmas movie!  Tim Allen is too funny and delivers a light hearted take on Santa - making it completely new.  Great for the Christmas Season with a cup of hot Cocoa. I know it's a classic and by Ann Bronte, but it is horribly sad and hard to watch.  It is also too graphic with adult content for my taste. We ended up throwing our copy away.  I think I'll stick to ""Jane Eyre"" or ""Wuthering Heights"" if I want a Bronte movie. I don't know what it is, but I have always felt drawn to Angela Lansbury as an Actress.  From her acting in ""Mrs. 'Arris Goes to Paris"", ""Gaslight"" ( her first screen role with Ingrid Bergman & Charles Boyer ), to Disney's ""Beauty and The Beast"" or even ""The Harvey Girls""  Murder She Wrote: It does have the occational cleavage/low necklines.  That aside, it is a wonderful series and Angela Lansbury is wonderful from begining to end. It is such a joy to watch this show, and it's even better on DVD - no commercials or interruptions.  Our whole family enjoys this show and love these new dvds This series is a very light hearted, funny one that's highly enjoyable.  ***Sadly, they did Not release the entire series.***  Only 4 or 5 episodes were put on 4 DVD releases.  But, for what it is, this is a very good DVD, ... just don't expect it to be the full Season. A TRUE CLASSIC!  Very Clean I'm happy to say.  Get ready for a movie marathon because you won't be able to decide when to stop and watch the rest later.  Update: This is one of my all time favorites to watch.  Once I get started, it's hard to stop.  I've had it a number of years now, but I still don't get tired of it ... which is a mark of a true classic. This series is a very light hearted, funny one that's highly enjoyable.  ***Sadly, they did Not release the entire series.***  Only 4 or 5 episodes were put on 4 DVD releases.  But, for what it is, this is a very good DVD, ... just don't expect it to be the full Season. This series is a very light hearted, funny one that's highly enjoyable.  ***Sadly, they did Not release the entire series.***  Only 4 or 5 episodes were put on 4 DVD releases.  But, for what it is, this is a very good DVD, ... just don't expect it to be the full Season. Not what I thought it would be. These older Miss Marple movies are HORRIBLE!  Bad audio, bad acting and large amounts of no dialog at all.  ( BLEGH! )  The Poirot movies are better, but they have some adult content on them that is just too much. This is a wonderful series for your entire family!  Clean and enjoyable... The star of the series ""Deanne Bray"" is actually deaf, but, can read lips - talk and use American Sign Language.  The whole cast is exceptional ~ don't pass this series up! ""Foyle's War"" has the occasional Adult content through the series.  But on the whole, it is very clean and enjoyable.  I wouldn't let anyone under 18 see it.  Some of the shows are even ""inspired"" by actual events that happened during World War 2.  It's a treat to see such an excellent War Series. When buying this, I thought ""Volume 1"" ment ""Season 1""... I was mistaken.  This is just the first DVD of Season 1.  I wish all DVDs had the same name and way of calling it.  Very confusing and it's different for every company - and even country. >.< The only thing I can't do and don't like is that the knee lifts and kicking out in front ... flares up my Neuropathy.  Other than that, it's a great DVD. This is an interesting story of the home-front during WWII.  Beware that is has a scene regarding a rape of a little boy by an SS officer, that child's body after he was hung,  as well as a graphic fight scene.  It is told from memories of a childhood but definitely not for the kids Loved this movie!  I never knew this story.  Saw many of the Canadian actors that I really enjoy as well.  Wonderful for the whole family.  I want my own copy to share with others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A3ESXROJQ5VWRZ," Fabulous!  Bright, colorful costumes and good scenery.  Excellent dancing by all of the dancers, especially Mr. Baryshnikov and Miss Harvey!  Some of the last dances were executed in the old movie, ""The Turning Point."" This is an excellent DVD, starring Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer.  It is also a true story of a priest working in the Vatican, who hides and transports many Jews and P.O.W.'s in and outside of Rome during WW II.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  It has plenty of suspense and some humor, as well.  An interesting outcome. This was a well-acted, well-produced and well-directed film of the famous operetta.  The singers all had marvelous voices, and the costumes and scenery were very good.  My only objection was that some of the dancing was rather risque for my taste.  I would hesitate to show this film to anyone under 20 years of age. An excellent production, from beginning to end!  The scenery, costumes and performances were all very credible.  The music was as beautiful as always.  I highly recommend this DVD for all opera fans. This film on DVD contains a rather predictable plot and has no surprises in it, but the plot is okay.  Every Randolph Scott fan should watch it and decide for himself. Excellent!!!  Beautiful singing by Miss Netrebko, Mr. Villazon and the supporting cast.  Moving and dramatic, a love story that holds one's attention from beginning to end.  I highly recommend this movie to all fans of La Boheme. This is a delightful comic opera, from beginning to end.  A lot of memorable music, in addition to the famous ""Una Furtiva Lagrima.""  I recommend it for every opera fan's collection. This is a very good production of La Traviata, starring Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon.  Their voices and acting are excellent, as is the music; however, the staging was a little nonconformist for my traditional tastes, so I gave this DVD only four stars. A good variety of arias sung by some of the very best in the opera world today.  Good entertainment.  Would have liked to have heard a little more from Ms. Gheorghiu, however. This is a heartwarming, realistic family story that could happen to any single parent struggling to make ends meet, and the kindness of some of the townspeople.  It held my attention throughout. This is an excellent DVD that has beautiful scenery of the Holy Land, including all of the special tourist sites, worship music, culture and the story of Jesus.  I highly recommend this DVD to all Christians. This is a little-known, and difficult-to-find movie, starring James Cagney.  It is very entertaining, however, and also stars Donald Crisp and Humphrey Bogart.  A lot of action and suspense and, of course, a woman is involved! This is an excellent production of the famous ballet, with beautiful costumes and clever scenery, as well as excellent dancers.  However, the ballet is three hours long, a bit long for my taste.  Some of the problem is due to several people in the audience demanding frequent bows from the dancers, which probably added a half hour to this production.  Without that interruption, the ballet would have been great!  And, perhaps the ballet is known to run long. I was very young when I watched this TV series, but it lived up to my expectations.  Jock Mahoney is suave and debonair in this show, and the plots are entertaining.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATOYU6QSA7E1T," I didn't think any remake of ""Jane Eyre"" could possibly be better than the version starring Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine.  This one is right up there.  I've watched it often, and I'm pleased that I could finally own a copy.  If you like the Bronte's books, I highly recommend this movie. One of my favorite movies.  I've watched it on TV many times, and decided I should just buy it!  Nick Nolte was the perfect choice for the lead, and Barbra Streisand is a very good actress.  For mature adults - even guys. The first ""Dirty Harry"" movie I ever saw, and I loved it.  Lots of violence, and the good guys win, which isn't always the way movies are done today.  Clint Eastwood was exactly the right choice for this movie and the succeeding Harry movies.  I plan to buy at least two more of this ""series."" I've seen this on the stage a few times, and always enjoyed it.  I was very pleased when the movie was made.  The subject matter is actually sad - the Russians were moving the Jews off their land - but the movie still managed to be moving and funny, and the musical parts are great.  Perhaps a little old-fashioned for some, but I recommend it for most. Anyone who loves Jane Austen should love this movie.  It's definitely a woman's movie, most men not caring for the affectations of the 1800s ""genteel"" class.  Lots of romance, heartbreak, and gorgeous scenery.  Second only to ""Pride and Prejudice.""  Highly recommended. It's a classic, of course, and I saw it many years ago.  It's been done more than once, but this is my favorite version.  The casting was wonderful, and the scenery breathtaking.  Good for any collection. This movie is full of excitement.  It may have been Gregory Peck's first movie, and he created a sensation as the ""bad boy.""  Although the sex scenes seem tame by today's standards, they created some controversy at the time.  Great performances by all the cast members. I've watched this movie every time it appears on TV, so I decided I should just buy it.  It's got some very funny scenes.  I especially enjoyed Anthony LaPaglia in his role as a ""shady"" character who is in love with Alan Alda's daughter.  A definite departure from his role in ""Without a Trace.""  Nice way to spend a couple of hours. This is an ""oldie,"" but I wanted it for my collection.  Even my children like it.  Ernest Borgnine was a fantastic actor, and we were all on his side when he finally broke away from his ""friends"" and went after the girl.  One of the few movies in which the man and woman were not handsome and beautiful, but they found happiness just the same.  Gives us all hope!  Recommended This is a great western.  I've watched it many times, and it finally became available.  No matter what character he played, Robert Taylor was always believable.  Lots of action and character studies. Highly recommended for lovers of the western genre.  Not a lot of shoot-em-ups.  This one mainly focused on the difficulties involved in travelling west with a wagon train of prospective brides. This is a good family story.  It shows how a woman who had been abducted by an Indian tribe was able to escape and return home.  There's enough action to keep viewers interested, and it portrayed what every day life was like in those days. I'm a fan of British films.  This one is about a woman whose biracial daughter has found her.  It's all centered on family - their reactions and their own problems.  The characters are very well cast.  The movie is enjoyable (not a downer), and I highly recommend it. This is the first of the Airport movies.  I think it is the best one.  Lots of action and good character studies.  Van Heflin as the villain is completely in character, as is Maureen Stapleton as his long-suffering wife.  You can't improve on a cast that includes Burt Lancaster, Dean Martin, Helen Hayes, George Kennedy, etc. Highly recommended. This was one of the first movies my husband and I watched when we were dating.  He didn't care for movies, but he laughed through most of this one.  I enjoy happy movies, and this is one.  No bad acting in this movie. This is a feel-good movie.  It's cute (notice the actors), has a nice storyline and a good ending.  A nice re-pairing of the actors from ""Sleepless in Seattle.""  If you liked that movie, you'll probably like this one. The stories were interesting, the way things came together was a surprise, and the actors were great.  It's a nice movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax.  Recommended. The stories were interesting, the way things came together was a surprise, and the actors were great.  It's a nice movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax.  Recommended. Brenda Blethyn seems to be in all of the British movies that I like.  This time she's a widow with a manor to maintain and big financial problems.  The manor's caretaker (Craig Ferguson) helps her solve them by installing a lucrative cash crop.  This is a great comedy, and I recommend it for men and women. I've been looking for this DVD for a long time.  In my opinion, he looked great and sounded great.  This is the Elvis we all loved.  Nobody wears black leather like he does! I didn't plan to see this movie, but it was just starting while I was channel surfing, so I thought I'd watch for a while.  After it was on for a short time, I couldn't turn it off.  Very different on many levels, and all of the actors are wonderful.  Sort of dark, but holds your interest.  Recommended for mature adults. I enjoyed this movie very much.  Not very original plot - father comes back into daughter's life.  Charlotte Church sings beautifully, and who knew that Craig Ferguson could act?  Nice movie when you just want to relax. This is a comedy, but it is a dark one.  I ordered it after seeing it on TV.  Maggie Smith and Rowan Atkinson are hilarious.  It sort of reminded me of ""Arsenic and Old Lace.""  It's funny, but with an edge.  All the characters are interesting and likable.  Highly recommended. This is a lovely movie.  The acting is so true to life.  Naomi Watts and Ed Norton were perfectly cast.  It doesn't have the hoped-for happy ending, but it's right for the story.  The music is beautiful.  I think women would like it more than men.  If you haven't seen it, you should. I enjoyed this movie very much.  Not very original plot - father comes back into daughter's life.

Glenn Ford was a big star ""in the day,"" and Shirley MacLaine was fairly new.  They were very good together.  This movie is about a man who decides to raise sheep in cattle country.

I'm sure the script is word-for-word identical to our beautiful in-color Audrey Hepburn version.  This is black and white and altogether charming.  Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard are perfect. This isn't a musical.  It's the play version, and I've watched it often.  Highly recommended. I had never heard of this movie until I saw it on TV.  Anything with Colin Firth is worth checking into, and I really liked this one.  The American bride was not welcomed into this very proper British family, and it is definitely a comedy.  Another surprise ending.  Pretty much a ""chick"" flick, and we all enjoyed it. Christina Aguilera is the star of this movie, and she has many opportunities to ""strut her stuff.""  However, Cher's performance made it clear that she's still going strong.  Not a great plot, but enjoyable.  Lots of music, and a good ending. I finally saw Andre Rieu in person, and his DVD does justice to a live performance.  The music is wonderful, and he surrounds himself with outstanding performers.  I highly recommend any of his DVDs. Ladies in my age group were wild about Tyrone Power.  This was one of his early movies before the studios realized that those good looks made him the perfect actor for the costume dramas (pirate, Zorro, swordsman).  He's paired with Sonia Henie, the woman who did for ice skating what Esther Williams did for swimming.  It's a lighthearted comedy, and very enjoyable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ADMVIW1UK8QWK," Samantha Morton won my heart in this absolutely amazing movie. I ended up purchasing every movie she made after seeing her in this. She's a really Great actress and I'm sure most anyone would enjoy this movie. God said to Abraham kill me a son, Abe said man you must be putting me on! God said NO! Abe said WHAT? God said you can do what you want to BUT...The next time you see me comin' you better run. Abe said Man, where you want this Killin' done? God said down on Highway 61... Amen (and so like that)... I'm a big Susan Sarandon fan and I never seen this movie. I guess I expected a better plot, but I just love Susan Sarandon, so I'd still give it a so so rating. The girls are ALL VERY PRETTY, but I wanted something more structured as a workout I guess. I thought this would get me off the couch and watch some naked babies go through a low impact exercise to help me lose some weight. I think ten year old boys would appreciate this dvd like I did with National Geographic when I was young. Like I said though, the girls are all beauties, but not what I expected. I remember when I was a kid how funny this show was. As you get older, some things you thought were GREAT are no longer. This series is timeless. I laugh every bit as hard as I did in the past and every show begins with the theme song. This is one of the all time funniest shows ever and you won't be disappointed. I just happen to adore Julianna Margulies which is why I bought this series. This can NO WAY compare to ""The Good Wife"", or even her roll on ""ER"", but it's MUCH better than ""Snakes On A Plane"" was. hahaha  It kept me entertained any way, the story line isn't written that well, but she's gorgeous and over all NOT A BAD SHOW. Season 2 was just as good as the first, the ONLY knock is I wish it continued and didn't end so quickly. These are some FUNNY Ladies and I miss them a lot!  It's a funnier version of ""Girls"" the HBO show, This show could have stuck around as long as the GREAT Seinfeld Show with all it's craziness!! I promise you'll laugh until you cry, give them a chance you won't be sorry. I think it was less then 15 minutes and I turned it off. Never even seen James Gandolfini... Waste of my time and money, terrible flop of a movie. I just couldn't get into it. I fell in love with Sasha Alexander on the T,V. show,""Rizzoli & Isles"". She's the only reason I bought this movie. I fell out of love with her about 20 minutes or so into this dud of a movie. She does a GREAT acting job on the T.V. show and to be kind, stick with the T.V. show and stay away from the ""B"" movies. I guess I expected more than I should have. The coming attractions apparently was the best parts of the movie. A few laughs, but more of a disappointment than anything. I thought this would be a can't miss movie.........Wrong!  Wait for this one to be on regular TV and it won't be as painful as purchasing it as I did. A GREAT Movie of a REAL American Hero. Amazing story that couldn't have ended sadder. The movie prompted me to purchase a 12x18 photo of him that I've framed and hung in my computer station in his honor. GREAT MOVIE that will not disappoint you. I enjoyed the complete series. This is one of the BETTER series I've ever seen and a tear jerking ending with some thought behind it for a change. Unlike the Soprano's and Seinfeld for instance. I've always been a Jeff Beck fan since the 70's, but I bought THIS DVD and the CD as well mainly for Imelda May. She doesn't have a DVD of her own, so this was the next best thing. I totally adore her and her voice and this DVD is GREAT from the get go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AJ2LYXJLB50TX," A real masterpiece of a miniseries, covering the lives and loves of the aristocratic Bellamy family and their servants from 1903-1930. Also includes behind the scenes footage, the 40th anniversary special with interviews, and the spinoff series Thomas and Sarah. Joan Crawford is in her element as a ruthless socialite who mentors violin virtuoso John Garfield (whose ""playing"" is actually done by Isaac Stern) and nearly leads to his professional and personal destruction. Highly entertaining! Underrated gem of a movie. A romance that takes place during one of the darkest periods of American history and also depicts the forced internment of Japanese and Japanese-Americans. Directed by Alan Parker (""Fame"", ""The Commitments"") and starring Dennis Quaid and Tamlyn Tomita. Lanza is in his element here, both vocally and acting-wise; his best dramatic work ever. Beautiful Sarita Montiel is his leading lady here, and she turns in a stellar performance and has excellent chemistry with Lanza. Mario Lanza's last film, and one of his best. He portrays the role of a temperamental opera star who transforms for the better when he meets and falls in love with beautiful Johanna von Kozien, who has lost her hearing in her childhood, due to a wartime bomb blast. The operatic highlights, including a heart-rending ""Vesti la Giubba"" (Pagliacci), are not to be missed. While Mario Lanza's singing is erratic in this film, the overall quality is very good. Stunning views of Rome, and memorable performances by Marisa Allasio and uncredited newcomer Luisa Di Meo. The scene where Lanza vocally mimics Perry Como, Dean Martin, Frankie Laine, and Louis Armstrong is exceptional, and shows a comedic side of Lanza rarely seen. A little movie with a big heart, about two sisters and their best friend coming of age in Mystic, Connecticut. Julia Roberts, Lili Taylor, and Annabeth Gish give excellent and unpretentious performances as the three protagonists. Great performances, writing, direction, and cinematography. I wish that they'd mentioned what happened to Sajjid's other siblings: Nazir, Abdul, Saleem, and Meenah. All we know is they never visit their parents. Otherwise, this is a very worthwhile dramedy. This is the first season of ""Chef"", and introduces us to uppity chef de cuisine Gareth Blackstock and various people in his life, namely his wife, Janice (a brilliant and witty woman who knows how to handle her flighty husband),his kitchen staff at the upscale Chateau Anglais, and many others. Hilarious and worth watching over and over again. Can never get enough of this show, and the bonus extras are fun. My favorite episodes in this season are the ones where Lindsay Lohan guest-starred as Betty's nemesis from junior and senior high school, Kimberly ""Kimmie"" Keegan. 22 year old Muriel Heslop(Toni Collette, in a stunning film debut) longs for love, marriage, and life beyond the confines of provincial Potpoise Spit, Australia. A wonderfully tragicomic emotional journey which also features the excellent performance of Rachel Griffiths, as Muriel's best friend Rhonda. Based on actual events that took place in Christchurch, New Zealand in the early 1950s, this must-see film boasts excellent debut performances by Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey and a stunning opera- and operetta-infused score. Filmed on location.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3SZ8584C7GNLU," I didn't expect to like it because I didn't like the original Planet of the Apes movie.  The original was too talky.  The characters talked all the time like they thought they could talk you into enjoying it.  The newer series of Planet of the Apes movies is good.  It had just the right amount of action and explanation.  It made a far fetched idea believable.  . I've loved Tom Selleck since I was a little girl.  I had a crush on him.  He always plays the good guy. He is always a strong man and if you ever saw his eyes and dimples in person you would melt.  This movie is up to snuff. I enjoyed it.  Of course my favorite is Quigley down under. no movie that Denzel does can be bad.  He is such a good actor.  I liked it because he made such a good father and it showed how much he wanted good things for his son.  I don't know that I would want to watch it a lot but I would watch it again Good movie about a girl who has had a lasting affect on our whole country.  It is hard to believe that conditions were like that and that people could be so mean. You would never recognize Charlize Theron.  There's no trace of her pretty face and gorgeous smile.  The movie presents the killer in a way that makes you feel sorry for her.  It was interesting. I never saw an Anthony Hopkins movie I didn't like.  I loved the scenery.  It was a good story.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone.  It is one of my favorites. Cruise ain't what he use to be.  The only reason I watched it was I got desperate for a good adventure.  It's an okay movie but I've seen a lot better.  Now I don't remember a lot about it.  Because after all it was just an okay movie and not a spectacular one. Good movie.  It shows how a whole town came to grips with their grief after a tragedy in which a lot of their kids and family members were killed in a plane crash.  I didn't like MM in his part that much.  I thought his performance was a bit weak but over all the movie was very inspirational. If murder can be funny then these guys sure do make it so.  They are so funny together.  They all seem so callus toward murder at times but then again, they seem to be the best of friends.  The plot just twists and turns so at times you don't know what is really up.  The second one is good too. This is a terrific movie for those of us who marvel at the wonders of life.  The good , the bad and the ugly.  I watched it three times when I rented it.  I will buy it too to keep.  Very inspirational.  It tells a story of two women who were devoted friends and their family members.  It crosses racial barriers very nicely. From the time it came out, I intended to watch see it.  I enjoyed it more than I thought.  Okay the story is a little hokey but it actually came off as more believable than I would have thought. excellent movie that shows the treachery of government entities.  they yield their power against each other with no thought of what is needed.  IN this case, it was the Bush Cheney duo that caused this woman to lose her career and jeopardized the safety of her family.  It shows just anther reason why Bush Cheney dup should have gone to jail. I would not have thought Charlize could make a good villian.  She usually looks so sweet and smiley nice.  But she did it very well and I will never her see her as only a ""sweetie""  again. It was a story that needed telling.  It tells the story of how black flyers contributed to the war effort.  It was a great movie and I would recommend it to all. I liked it very much.  It was entertaining and funny at times.  I guess I am still old fashioned enough to still want to see the bad guys take a beating. It was a great movie.  Hope our civilization never comes to that.  I loved Jennifer Lawrence in this movie.  She looked so naturally sexy.  I think it actually is worth a sequel. This is one of my favorite series of English shows.  It is so entertaining watching the nuns and nurses go out into the poor communities to help poor families with their babies.  So many separate human stories are told before your eyes. I loved it too.  The newer series of Planet of the Apes movies is really good.  I's recommend all of the newer ones where as I did not like the original ones I liked it very much.  It was entertaining and funny at times.  I guess I am still old fashioned enough to still want to see the bad guys take a beating. One of the most fascinating movies I've ever seen.  The whole welfare of the whole human race rests on a kid and the decision he will make but you don't know that until it is done.  Loved it. I like a lot of these English productions that come in episodes.  The Call the Midwife ones are really good.  You feel like you are there in that time watching poor mums struggle to bring their sweet babes into the world and what the nurses had to do to help them.  Great show good movie.  I like watching movies on amazon. great  but I don't like this word requirement to leave feed back.  It should be my choice if I only want to use a few words. Now this is a great action movie and Denzel does it like only Denzel can.  I would add this one to my collection and I would recommend it to any Denzel fan or action movie fan.  It's just a great movie. He gets the bad guys and he gets his daughter back.  it's a good story.  It just kind of end in a non dramatic way.  It just didn't seem proportional to the subject and the rest of the movie.  It wouldn't be my first choice and I would not add it to my collection. I think David Oyelowo made a good Martin Luther King.  I don't know how factual it is but I felt it gave me more insight into a situation I knew little about other than hearing some of the speeches given by Dr King. good movie.  the woman will gain your sympathy right away because she is such a warm person.  Very pretty too.  makes you feel like she was just one woman who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1FZHLJHSGT4DN," I really enjoyed this movie. I think this was Dicaprio's best acting ever. I don't think he is as good an actor now as he was when he was younger. I just saw him in The Great Gatsby and even though I enjoyed the movie I don't think he is that great an actor anymore. But this movie I highly recommend. I enjoyed this movie. The story and the actors were great. I believe this was Gerard Butler's very first movie role. He play's Archie, the main character John Brown's younger brother. Gerard must have been around 27 or 28 when this was filmed. This man was truly an AMAZING, CHARISMATIC, HANDSOME actor. He did not even need to speak. I really enjoyed this movie. I never knew anything about him except that he died young and his death caused chaos among his female fans and some even committed suicide. I now can understand them. I will be checking out his other films too. This has always been one of my favorite's of Elvis' films. He was so young and handsome. I love the music in itElvis was a very talented man in every way and in everything he did. What can I say but that it was a beautifully made film. Shah Rukh and Rani have alot of chemistry on screen. The costumes and music was awesome. This is a movie worth buying. I recommend it to anyone. my niece didn't like Shah Rukh mustache in the film. Said she could not take him seriously with that mustache. lol. I heard He himself didn't like wearing it either. Shah Rukh was fabulous as always. He really knows how to bring his characters to life. This was a very good film. I recommend it. I love these type of historical films. Great cast. Beautiful Romeo & Juliet type romance. Very well made entertaining movie. Even my teenage niece and 10 year old nephew enjoyed this film. It had comedy, romance, music, adventure and sometimes it was sad. Shah Rukh and Kajol have a lot of chemistry together on screen. This one is definitely a keeper. After renting it I just had to have my own DVD and blu ray. Great film! I have a hard time understanding what he saw in the woman in this movie because I found her very unlikeable. I guess love really is blind. Shah Rukh as always did an award winning job. And the scene with the music and dancing on top of train was amazing and simply spectacular. It was favorite scene in the movie. I love the music in the film. Shah Rukh Khan does it again! another great film. No wonder he is so loved. He is so charming. Anyway I thought the film was very well made. My brother insists he would have changed the ending but still enjoyed it. I highly recommend this movie. Beautiful. My 13 year old niece says this is her favorite indian movie after My Name is Khan. It was alright but even though I like Clive Owen I found myself waiting for this movie to end. I would not own it. To me it's good enough to rent but I would not buy it because I doubt I would watch this movie again. Great movie. SRK is truly an amazing actor. His perfomances are always do mesmerizing. I wish some of these movies can be dubbed in english though. Sometimes I have to dvd to know what they are saying. Buty story was very interesting and alll the actors were well cast. I recommend to movie to anyone. I rented this from Netflix and decided  to order it from amazon. I would like to watch it again. The acting and story are very good. It's actually a tragic story but I guess I like these kind of movies sometimes. It's too bad Natasha Richardon died so young because I thought she was one of the best and natural actresses. She made alot of great movies. So she didn't disappoint me with this one either. I have to watch this movie again but I know I enjoyed it and I think Shahrukh. Khan is the best actor. I read someone said this was worst movie they have seen and I could not believe it. It may not be Shahrukh's best but not his worst film either. I found some scenes very funny. I enjoyed watching Shah Rukh play the good guy as well as the bad. He is such a great actor. I do recommend this film. Very good. I loved the music and dancing scenes. I wanted to like this movie after reading the 'Great reviews'??? The Most I would give it is 2 1/2 stars. I liked the actors except I am not much of a fan of Salmon Khan. I fast forwarded through most of the DVD. I found it mostly a dull, boring, slow and a very predictable movie. I would not watch it again. Once was enough for me. I thought it was a pretty decent movie. I thought it was going to be one of those cheesy stupid gory movies but I liked it. Of course it helps that Josh Duhamel was in it. I recommend it. I watched this movie in the theatre when my now 13 year old niece was 11 and didn't know til now that Gerard plays Nim's father in the movie. Since becoming a fan of his I had to buy this movie and am glad I did. My other niece also loves this movie. I would give it 2 1/2 stars if I could. I did not dislike it but I did not like it enough to watch it again or buy the DVD. The actors are good but the movie did not hold my interest. I bought the dvd because of William Levy who plays Vasco and so far have not seen the whole dvd but I could see it is a really good story. And it helps to watch someone as gorgeous as William. Compre este dvd simplemente porque supe que William Levy iso el papel de Vasco y me fascina este actor. No ha visto la novela entera pero parese bien buen auque ""Vasco"" ayuda mucho simplemente por estar en ella. At first I thought this movie was a little strange. Different from what I am used to. But I really enjoyed it. Great casting and acting. Gerard comes through again. So glad he decided to become an actor instead of a lawyer. Lol. He ROCKS!. So glad I bought this movie. The story was good but kind of slow sometimes. But it is the kind of movie I could watch again. Don't know if I could say that if Gerard Butler was not in it though. He makes the movie worthwhile for sure. I really enjoyed this film and my brother has watched it at least a dozen times. He thinks this is one of Shahrukh Khan's best films. along with Om Shanti Om and Don to name a few. great movie. I liked this movie so much after renting it from Netflix I decided to buy it...Gerard Butler is one of the most versatile actors I've seen in a long time...He makes the movies even more enjoyable to watch. This has to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time...I love movies that are so unpredictable. Great performances by the actors. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I think they should've done an alternate ending or ended it differently. But this is One of those movies I could watch over and over without being bored. I absolutely loved this movie and is now one of my fave's. Josh Duhamel is such a funny and sexy man. This movie made me laugh from beginning to end. Some parts reminded me of my trip to Rome Italy last year. Wonderful and entertaining movie. Definetely recommend it. Wow this movie was amazing. One of the best foreign films ever made! It was beautifully made. The actors were awesome. It made me laugh and it made me cry. A truly moving film. A must see. I rented it from Netflix and just had to buy it.  Once in a while a film comes along that moves you and you can't forget it. this is one of those movies. Inspirational.  I have recommended it to everyone I know. I enjoyed this movie even more second time I watched it. I admit Josh is main reason I love this movie. But it was a good story. I didn't care much for the brownie scene but I did like the movie and went out and bought it. Yes I recommend this movie to anyone. Rudy Valentino truly was unique. He had so mush talent and charisma, it's easy to see why he was so popular. He didn't need to speak. His face expressions was good enough. This sequel maybe even better than the first Don movie. My 10 year old nephew loved it and wants to see Don 3, if it was made. He says even though Don is a bad guy he doesn't want him to get caught or die. Shah Rukh plays the character so cool it's hard to hate him. He is So bad and sexy at same time. Yes I loved this film. I really liked this movie and the actors. Great story and was not boring at all. Josh Duhamel as always comes through. He is such a natural actor. And it helps that Bruce Willis was in it. This movie gave me goosebumps in some scenes. It makes me want to cover my feet when I go to bed at night. It's one of those movies I could watch over and over and still jump and get scared every time. A true classic horror at its best. It kept my interest the whole time. I loved it. Great actors and story. Yes I recommend it. This is 2nd movie I have watched of shahnukh khan since My name is Khan which I truly enjoyed. I love the music especially and the dancing. Great actors and story. Wish I could find it in English rather than just reading the subtitles.  Yes I recommend this film. Of Josh Duhamel and he is the only reason I wanted to see this movie and they saved him for last...otherwise it was a horrible distasteful movie and how stars like josh Duhamel, Gerard Butler and Hugh Jackman could be a part of this movie is shocking to me. I kept thinking that someone must have been really drunk or high on drugs to make up this movie.  It was sick and pathetic. Waste of money and time. I added this to my list of favorite Bollywood films. Shahrukh as usual doesn't disappoint. He truly is the King of Bollywood and movies as far as I am concerned. He is great in any role, whether he is in a comedy of dramatic role.  He can be Funny and sexy at same time. May he keep entertaining us for many more years to come with his charisma and talent. This movie was really good. It is one of those I didn't want it to end movies. Great cast and story. So glad I bought dvd. Shah Rukh Khan is the best. He is so natural and fun to watch on screen. I see why he is called King Khan. Good movie to rent but I would not buy it. Good actors but I found the story a bit boring at times. I don't know why some people give it more than four stars but as they say 'to each their own'. I really enjoyed this movie. Shah Rukh always delivers. I recommend it. So glad i purchased it. This is a movie I could not just rent. I had to have it. My favorite was when Shahrukh was drunk and talking to the white horse statue in his house. I thought was his best performance in the film. Funny and sad at same time. I just wish there were more scenes of Him dancing. But anyway very nice movie. I loved this dvd set. I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of Shahrukh Khan. He is an amazing actor, performer, person. I am very happy I bought this. The main reason I bought this movie was because of Gerard Butler. The movie was a bit strange but I am happy to have bought it. Can't get enough of Gerry. I thought this was a good mid 1990's film of Shah Rukh Khan's early films. I think it started a little slow but it got better by middle of film. If you are a Shah Rukh fan like me it is worth watching this film or buying the DVD, I think. I Really enjoyed this movie. Great job by all the actors. Especially Shah Rukh. He hasn't disappointed me yet. He Gives 100% in every role he plays. Just goes to show he really is King of Bollywood. This is a lot like West Side Story, only better I think. And as someone else here put it, to each their own taste. I really liked this film and the story... So much that I decided to buy the book also. I have not watched alot of british movies and didn't know what to expect but i was not disappointed. I don't know if this was the young actor Alex pettyfer's first movie but he did very well. I was impressed. Wonderful story and acting. I see now why it is also one of Shah Rukh's favorite of his films. Yes I think it was one of his best performances also. And besides being so talented in every aspect he was and is a very handsome and charismatic man/actor. So glad i bought this film. My 10 year old nephew loved this film with or without subtitles. For him to say that it is one of his best films, even better than my Name is Khan or Ra. One, says alot about the film. We truly enjoyed it. Even though Shah Rukh was hardly in it, mostly in beginning and ending of film is when we see him in the film and some parts in between.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A27MKOVSDQSXFZ," I actually rather enjoyed this movie.  A little annoying at times with all the silly younger women, but the brassy ex-wives were fun to follow.  Not my favorite all-time movie, but worth a watch every ten years or so. HMMM----I used to love this movie and laughed my head off back in the day.  Sometimes interesting but pretty out-dated for my tastes now.  The ""girls"" taking over the corporation is a good storyline with the promise of plenty of entertainment along the way, but the directing and shenanigans definitely puts this in another era for me. I never tire of watching The Waltons over and over (and over) again. The characters are well casted and enjoyable to watch.  Once john Boy leaves the show, the scripts start sliding, sinking into that back hole of demise by using a good family show to make the producer's political comment.  Always a sure sign the show is tanking.  But Season 5, John Boy's last, still holds the charm----the final charm of a GREAT series through season 5. Smoking; acting, content; all outdated.  Loved it as a child, not so much now.  Leave it To Beaver is still loved enjoyed by myself and the grandkids.  Much better pick in my opinion.  I didn't even finish the first story on the first DVD as it was too off-putting. Smoking; acting, content; all outdated.  Loved it as a child, not so much now.  Leave it To Beaver is still loved enjoyed by myself and the grandkids.  Much better pick in my opinion.  I didn't even finish the first story on the first DVD as it was too off-putting. A little slow----and I like clean quiet movies----a little predictable.  Nothing outlandish; nothing surprising or earth shattering.  Pretty implausible, but what the heck.  Two ladies, and older and a younger one, stay on the beach for the summer and become acquainted with two men, and older and a younger one, who are manning the lighthouse.  Romance is stirred up, amends made and they all live happily ever after. I loved this movie, but it's one of those ""quiet"" movies that won't be for everybody.  A little unbelievable, but if you like warm fuzzy movies and are willing to over-look a few ""Yah, right!"" moments, you will find a charming little film.  Four stars because of those ho-hum moments. Review is the same as for Season 1----LOVE these episodes.  Can't see any of the men in my family getting into it but my 14 nurse and female doctor family thoroughly enjoy it. Grandkids, ages 6, 8, 11 deemed this sequel (after MONTHS of waiting), to be disappointing.  ""Not what we thought it would be"".  they went bak to watching Finding Nemo.  Too many flashbacks to Nemo which tells me the creators had trouble putting together a story that would fly on it's own. this is just plain period entertainment at its best.  I've watched this movie a dozen times and never get tired of it.  GREAT casting, GREAT scenery, GREAT story.  Timeless and classic. I LOVE Maggie Smith, but this was way too dated for me.  I was a teen in the 60's but find all those movies to cotton candy for me.  I groaned through about half an hour of this BORING thing before deciding life is too short to waste another minute on something that is this uninteresting.  Two stars just for Maggie.  NOT funny. I remembered this as being way more charming than it seemed this time around.  But the scenery is beautiful and I love Vanessa Redgrave.  The younger woman's pompous game playing was to me both callous and insensitive next to Redgrave's maturity and genuine interest.  I think that comparison undercut the enjoyment I remembered about this movie. Language was too much and too constant.  Turned it off without finishing the first disk.  Glad I didn't order the whole multi-season series.  If language is a problem for you----stay away from this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3EZHMGGWY74HY," This is by far the best Jane Eyre out there at this time...the performances are brilliant, the original text respected...the character of Rochester is for once done as it was meant to be done.  I highly recommend, if you like your movies to show some respect for the books they represent. Mr. Limpet takes me back...it was one of my favorite movies as a child. I remember watching it whenever it was on.  We have this movie, and my daughter likes it, but only the animated parts.  She can't understand the submarine, or the war...thankfully...but enjoys seeing a fish who wears glasses.  Her other all time favorite Don Knotts film is ""THE GHOST AND MR. CHICKEN."" This is pure family fun, nothing you wouldn't feel comfortable having your children see. This is one of my favorite romantic comedies.  What a wonderful idea, that someone could be so lonely one day, have fantasies about one man, and fall in love with another!  The idea that the main character seems to crave a family life, and then finds one for herself is so great.  For once she wasn't on the outside looking in.  5 stars! I remember this movie from when I was little and it was one of my favorites.  If you were a big fan of Little House, then maybe you might enjoy this film.  It's great for the whole family.  I like the fact that it taught a bit about the history of our country, yet entertained as well. The children were adorable and did a pretty good job acting in what was most likely their first film. This movie was an unexpected find....quirky and fun....not for kids, but adults will find it amusing and worth the watch.  There are some big names here in this movie and their performances will delight! My husband and I love this movie.  No, it's not the scariest movie ever.  No, the story isn't the most horrifying.  But, it brings back so many memories of Saturday afternoons when we watched horror movies.  Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are the best and have been in many of our favorite movies.  We had a ball watching this, and anyone who remembers it from years ago, should definately add it to their collection. I have become so tired of horror movies that give me so much gore and no substance.  I'm tired of movies that show me such grand special effects that I forget to be scared.  Nightwatch is the exact opposite.....what a scary movie...through the simple use of light, shadow, not to mention that WIND!  It was creepy all the way through to the end.  A must see for anyone who enjoys a good old fashioned scare. I think I can just about act out any part in this movie at this point.  Since this past Friday, I've watched it about 15 times.  The kids love it and want to watch it over and over again.  It is a darling movie about that little ant that just wouldn't give up.  Great lessons for our children along with dazzling Disney animation.  Highly recommended. A wonderful adaptation of a classic.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it just isn't one of my favorite plays...but still very well done. This is one of our favorite classic horror films, and I was so happy to find a used copy (in VERY GOOD CONDITION) here on Amazon.  It was a gift for a classic horror fan, and it went over as well as I thought it would, if not better!  Thanks Amazon! This collection of dvd's is so well put together that I highly recommend to any Buffy fan.  You shouldn't be without!  I took two days off from work, put my feet up and watched Buffy, Season Two.  It was well worth it...I enjoyed it so much.  Sit back and enjoy! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes stories about independent spirited women, not to mention Johnny Depp!  He was wonderful in this movie, as was everyone else.  The unique characters were delightful and it's a refreshing movie.  This one woman touches so many lives, even the lives of those that try to avoid her.  She changes their lives for the better, whether they wanted it or not!  Just a joy to watch. I remember the first night Buffy aired on tv...I was amazed at what a refreshing, exciting show it was.  Now I have it on dvd and I couldn't be more pleased.  It's great to have this collection of hip, scary and amusing episodes, in order, whenever I want them.  This is by far my favorite season.  I think any Buffy fan will not be disappointed with this purchase. ""Violence"" is all I can say about this movie.  Certainly not my cup of tea, but the men in my life love it.  It reminded me a bit of Pulp Fiction...not sure why, but it did.  It was strangely engrossing, but I was also disturbed by the amount of violence throughout the film. My family waited and waited for the release of the latest Garfield movie.  We thoroughly enjoy the first, watching over and over.  We popped this one in and fifteen minutes later were off doing other things.  It just didn't capture our attention, even the children weren't impressed.  The first one is top notch...funny, original, etc.  This one was just too much of a stretch...even for a movie about a talking kitty. Brian Addams does a fantastic job with the music in this film and it was by far my favorite part of the film, from an adult perspective.  The story itself is a great one for kids who love horses.  It's a lesson in trust and friendship they won't soon forget, and you won't forget the fantastic soundtrack. If you kids love dinosaur movies, and love realism...this is it.  The animation is spectacular, and the story is sweet and teaches compassion and courage.  Disney has done it again...in an unexpected way.  Very different from their other offerings, but one of their best. If you were wondering if you should purchase this film for the children in your life, don't hesitate!  I know a little 2 year old who is glued to the tv whenever this movie is on.  She loves animals and enjoys watching Garfield save Odie.  Even the adults have found this film enjoyable...Bill Murray does a nice job voicing Garfield. (That was Bill Murray, wasn't it??!!)  Give this one a try...the kiddies will love it. I Dream of Jeannie is good, clean family fun.  There aren't many sitcoms out there that the whole family can watch without fear these days.  The 1970's sitcoms were perfect for most anyone to watch and that's what I love about them.  To think that her belly button caused such a stir back then! This movie was quirky, quick paced, amusing and charming.  The main character's odd personality is so perfect and watching him try to bond with this dog is hysterical. I think the script was well written and the casting was perfection! Give this a try, you'll get a good laugh. I admit, I rented this because I saw Gary Oldman's picture on the disc cover, but what a disappointment.  What were you thinking, Gary?  His acting, as always, was wonderful, however, the storyline/script was horrid and a waste of his ability and time.  I was greatly disappointed, and was only able to give it more than one star because of Gary's performance.

I was greatly disappointed, and was only able to give it more than one star because of Gary's performance. This is a super family film, a story about friendship that can be appreciated by anyone of any age.  The music is outstanding, is quite catchy and I think I know most of the words to most of the songs already! Do not hesitate with this one as a gift for any little girl who loves Barbie. You won't be disappointed. It's about time we got away from mindless slasher films and someone came up with a film that's just plain scary...the setting, the situation, the victims are believable and we like them...no college level bimbos here...intelligent casting as well.  Just a good, knot in your throat, OH MY GOD I'M SCARED...film.  I almost turned it off because it scared me a bit too much. This is a good quality scary show for kids. My daughter loved it, as she loves most scary shows, however, I was hesitant as some shows can be just a bit too scary, but this one was just right.  The ghosts/bad guys had some funny lines, which lightened up the situations.  The cast of kids did a nice job acting...all in all, I highly recommend for kids 5 and up. I laughed and laughed through this one.  Not taking anything away from Ben Stiller because he is a funny guy, however, Hank Azarra (or however you spell his name) was just the BEST!  Everytime he opened his mouth, I just couldn't help myself.  Don't be afraid to give this sequel a try.  It's quality storyline and cast will leave you wanting more. Ok, first off, he's not a monster, although he's billed as one.  Everywhere I have seen Gooby described, the word ""monster"" is used, but he is just a very large teddy bear.  My children were expecting a monster and got an oversized stuff animal.  I disliked how lots of the situations were handled and also thought the ending was unsatisfactory.  I just wasn't happy with this one. If you children loved the new Chipmunk movie staring the adorable Chipettes, then this will be a great addition to their dvd collection.  I believe these may have been done in the early 90's, but they are timely and fun and as cute as their modern counterparts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
APDUCWHP5J905," It has everything: wonderful story, unique characters, and the romance. I absolutely loved it. This series is a unique look at the Grimm Brothers' fairy tales from a darker prospective. This is not for children because of violence and adult situations. Overall, this is great, I highly recommend it. Jannifer Garner is truely wonderful in this funny and entertaining romantic comedy. This is a movie about how personal choices can impact one's fate. Careful ladies, don't toss aside your male friends, they might become your husbands in the future! The first season was very good. The acting is fantastic, and I don't know why some people here say it's bad. It is very realistic. But the continuing kidnapping and rescuing became a little too far fetched and got a little boring. The 2nd season is a lot better. Night Watch has a very interesting story and characters but the movie makers didn't put it well together. There are a bunch of different stories in the movie that have no connection like the damned lady, the vampiress, the young boy.....the movie is hard to follow. Hopefully the next two parts will be better. Good, solid entertainment for the casual audiences. Will Smith is great as always, the set designs are pretty good too. The vampire like creatures look a little cartoonish, but overall this is a pretty good movie. It is always nice to see an innocent romance without any sex involved. But this movie is plain boring. Throughout the whole movie Ziyi's character is running through the woods chasing the boy. It is unclear why they even fell in love with each other. I gave it 2 stars for excellent scenery. It is sad, touching, and beautiful. This anime series is about friendship, loyalty, loss of innocence and war. It is great from start to finish with wonderful animation and a very deep character development. One of the best anime series ever made. Enjoy it while you can because later Buffy's characters starts to change for the worse. While here she is still a super hero type with values and ideals. Later she becomes somebody people try to avoid, an antihero with baggage, emotional drama, and lack of possitive qualities a hero needs to be a hero. I guess the writers and directors wanted to attracted older audiences to watch this, but they made a mistake of changing Buffy for the worst. This was an interesting a strange looking film, but entertaining. At first it was hard to understand what was happening but then it all came together. The acting is very good. The beginning is great with fast paced action, beautiful girls, and lots of buttkicking. But after about half an hour it suddenly starts to drag on. The romance is totally misplaced, the characters are dull, and the plot is completely undeveloped. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. To start with, I don't know why this is called ""anime"", this was not made by the Japanese. The movie has potential to be good, but it has too much unnecessary dialog with lots of cheese and the animation is below average. I don't even know where to begin to describe how crappy this show is. It's about a bunch of rich and spoiled kids running around with their problems and creating even more drama ahead of them. This is just like Laguna Beach, except this is not reality TV. All they do is lounge around each others pool, drink and argue who should date who and who dumped who. BORING AND POINTLESS. The movie certainly had a great start: an ambitious journalism student in search of her big break finally got her hands on something that might turn out to be the story of the year, met a rich and handsome businessman, fell in love and yudda yudda yudda. Woody Allen's character is annoying because he won't stop talking and the ending is disappointing. When the movie ended i felt like the story wasn't finished. I heard a lot of good things about this movie and was curious about it. What a disappointment!! Hepburn's character is shallow, unballanced and extremely unlikable. I couldn't keep from wondering why did Peppard's character ever fall in love with her. There is no plot, no character development, just boredom. Even though nothing in this movie resembles reality, the plot is funny and entertaining. Adam and Drew have chemestry. Overall it is a good natured romantic comedy that makes you daydream about the silly things that people do for love. I have noooo idea why people like it. The story is awful, the plot is boring and the characters are extremely shallow. It is not even funny!! It's about two teenage girls fighting for the affections of another little crybaby girl. What is so interesting about that? The events in the film have absolutely no connection and the plot is random.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2FTHCGH06O4Y5," Watchable film, certainly; but:  1.  Make sure you're not getting the fullscreen version, as I inadvertently did.  2.  Movie horribly dated by crude 80's-style music.  Alas!  3.  Matthew Broderick is loveable but should not have been in this, if you think about it for a second.  His role called for someone who was more wiry and less innocent-faced. Bleedin' shame director James Cameron was such a ninny at the Oscars.  And that Kate Winslet was such a temperamental diva.  And that Leonardo is such a heartthrob.  And that this movie was so expensive to make.  Because focusing on any of those irrelevant things will prevent you from enjoying one of the most immersing movies ever made.  Danged if after watching it, you don't feel like you were actually on the Titanic yourself! Delightful yarn about an American soldier who betrays his country by providing firearms and military assistance to the enemy, then assists in the massacre of several of his fellow soldiers when they attempt to bring him to justice.  Great for the whole family! Despite its generally positive reputation, I fail to see what's so special about this.  The main character is basically a housewife who spends the movie doing her running around:  first she's gotta she this guy, then she's gotta see that guy, then this guy, then another, etc. So fecund, so multi-faceted, and so brimming with scalding tears is the Holocaust that the minute a mediocre movie about it rears its head, it oughta be run out of town.  Lifeless characters, mismanaged tension, and a punch-pulling script all help to make ""The Boat is Full"" the most forgettable film I have ever seen about the Holocaust.  Strictly for completists. Poorly directed and thoroughly uninteresting.  I am at a loss to explain why so many people have rated this film so highly:  I personally got nothing out of it.  The plot is convoluted and has many red herrings; the pace slogs in the middle; the main character is frigid and unreadable, and the climactic moment of passion is confusing and predictable. This is the kind of movie that makes you just want to check out of the human race, to deny ever having had anything to do with it!  The only glimmer of relief, though, is that there were humans sensitive and self-aware enough to have brought such a film off so beautifully, so that is some comfort. Since those responsible for this animated version of ""Animal Farm"" failed to renew their copyright (this came out in 1954), this film is now freely available, for example on YouTube, where it can be legally uploaded in its entirety.  It follows the book much more than the recent version did, although still very loosely.  The biggest difference is its completely different, more hopeful ending. One of the 5 funniest movies I know of.  But I don't think this was a good move, in retrospect, for Ron Livingston.  He is so hilarious and memorable in this role that, at least for me, it has been impossible to take him seriously in any other role, such as the officer in BAND OF BROTHERS. If you're reading Madame Bovary, either in French or in English, and would like a movie to help sort you out, I would definitely avoid this one.  It doesn't follow the book very closely (scenes are out of order, something done in the book by one character is done in the film by another, major plot points are missing, etc.).  The actress does a terrific job, though. With 3,594 reviews and climbing (as of my writing) there's little chance of anybody reading what I have to say, so what's the point?  I will say this:  watching this 3-volume set (the extended editions) was the most comprehensively satisfying cinematic experience of my life. It old material, from around 1980, judging from their clothes.  Less than an hour long.  The video is not good.  The sound is not good.  But people are buying it because it is an official Rush release, and Rush released it long ago for VHS.  It only recently has been released for DVD.  But nothing has been added:  there are no bonus interviews or anything, or special features. Not only one of the most exquisitely wrought movies I'm aware of, it's one of the most perfectly laid out stories I've ever come across.  More to the point, the film teaches an important moral lesson:  never trust the French postal service. I enjoyed this movie.  I thought its strengths outweighed its weaknesses.  The movie took its time, which I felt was wise:  It was more enjoyable watching Philo getting there than to see him actually get there.  One thing, though: the orangutan was gimmicky.  The script could have gotten along just fine without it.  The film would probably have been more insightful if it had ditched the ape and the slapstick.  Good ending. Sort of kind of inspiring.  Sort of.  Until you realize that all these two people are doing is churning out a bunch of four-chord songs.  Spirited job on the part of the actors, though. Despite a workable premise (magic toy store), this movie is relentlessly depressing.  The kids came to see a movie about magic, wonder, and loony fun . . . not about death and decay!  And why is Dustin Hoffman still getting roles?  He's been playing the same character for the last twenty years!  How is he still getting work? Sort of kind of inspiring.  Sort of.

And why is Dustin Hoffman still getting roles?  He's been playing the same character for the last twenty years!  How is he still getting work? I couldn't believe this movie for a second:  it soon grew exhausting to watch since the behavior of the principle characters bore no relation to human behavior as I've ever seen it.  At that age, bullies do not risk everything to make friends with the nerdy kid just for the sake of doing so.  It would be nice if that were true, but everybody knows it isn't.

As they usually say in such matters, the book was much more nuanced, the philosophy deeper.  Plus, the adventures were almost all different.  Still, this is an uplifting movie with a message that's worth your time. I've also read the book.  As they usually say in such matters, the book was much more nuanced, the philosophy deeper.  Plus, the adventures were almost all different.  Still, this is an uplifting movie with a message that's worth your time. A fun retro look, but the constant sarcastic tone and unending supply of adults-only jokes will make this hard for kids to enjoy.  1.  The fact that the movie is pretty much one extended chase scene gets quite trying. 2.  This thing is chock-full of so many references to other sci-fi movies and books it's distracting. 6 shorts in the style of ""Wallace and Gromit.""  They've all got spooky, magical plotlines -- hence the title.  There are no words in any of the episodes:  everything is just sound effects and grunts.  The humor is broad:  kids might love it, but an adult is unlikely to watch this twice. I don't care how rabid a Rush fan you are, your jaw is going to hit the floor before you've gotten 10 minutes into it.  The footage they got (raiding the closets of the trio's families!) is beyond belief.  If you've just ordered this from Amazon and it hasn't arrived yet, I'll tell you this:  get your hopes up.  It's gonna deliver. Wow.  Two whole hours of this.  I could not be more satisfied.  I'm hugely into this sort of stuff but until now have never found a satisfying documentary about the business of whaling.  I was afraid this was going to agonizingly short (e.g., 30 minutes), but no!  After two hours of exploring every possible angle of American whaling, you'll be hard-pressed to come up with something the documentary did not do right. Season two?!  Are you kidding me?  How did this get picked up again?  The only thing this show manages to teach you -- and teach you well it does -- is never to sell anything to a pawn shop.  Head for eBay instead.  The show consists of one segment after another of some chump getting way less for his item than he could have, had he been a little smarter about it.  Extremely unsatisfying TV. I found it superb, but it's not surprising this only had a limited art-house release:  its relentlessly lonely feel will really grind you down.  But I love depressing movies that don't provide much grounds for hope:  I wish they'd make more of them.  I could have sat there and watched this depressed, unwanted girl roam through London for hours and hours without getting bored. I think this film is silly.  The writer (it was apparently based on a book) has no insights to convey about love, Arabs, Yemeni society, fishing, life in a British government, or anything I'm aware of.  Nevertheless, the project was green-lighted all the way through! But I'm the one writing this review, so five stars it is.  What a fantastic job they did.  The real standout for me was the backgrounds, how they make Victorian London look.  Also great character design.  The plot I also found simple but imaginative.  Also terrific voice acting.  Nothing but praise from me. There were 52 episodes on TV.  They're divided between two DVD collections.  As far as I can tell, only the first is available on Amazon.  For the other you have to go directly to the Annenberg website itself. Not sure what all the excitement is about.  Who was this for?  It's far too scary to be a kids' movie; not scary enough to be an adults' movie, and it gets off to an awfully slow start, with many unnecessary characters.  And it was just to trippy, too dreamy.  I know it comes from a book, and it probably works better as a book.  The relentlessly surreal sequences toward the end got to be too much. User Amazon AZJW-TFPU-TYGA-BX5P and buy that one instead.  It's a much better done DVD.  In particular, it has subtitles.  Since these actors are speaking in heavy Irish, British, New Zealand, etc. accents, you'll only be able to understand about 70% of what they say if you're an ordinary American.  You'll need subtitles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A121LU1P40URV," My daughter and I both love this movie.  We love the intersection of animation and live action, the juxtaposition of fairy tale and grim reality.  The little girl who plays the lawyers daughter is charming without being annoying and overly precocious.  And Amy Adams is perfect in this role as a fairy tale character dropped into New York City.  We watch this one over and over. Ginger Rogers won an Academy Award for her role in this film... although it may have been recognition of her amazing work in ""Primrose Path"" more than this movie itself.  It is a bit long, a bit soap opera-y... but Rogers keeps above the melodrama and turns in a nuanced, honest performance.  I can watch this over and over. Good escapist flick for a Friday night rental.  Colin Firth is smooth and dangerous.  His young trainee holds his own with Firth.  Samuel Jackson is a little annoying - but he is supposed to be. I watched this again recently, and still enjoy it.  Jeanene Garafalo is much less acerbic than her current stand-up routines -- but she still has some zingers.  The phone sex scene is fun.  The relationship between Uma Thurman and Garafalo rings very true - and makes me glad I am no longer in my 20s. My daughter loves this movie, based on a true story, about the Hawaiian girl, Bethany Hamilton, who lost an arm to a white shark and, more importantly, the story of her recovery. Fairly close to the actual story.  Prepare children for the shark attack scene which is pretty intense, although done with a minimal amount of gore.  The DVD has extras about Bethany herself and about the making of the film; the streaming version does not. This is another movie I can watch over and over.  It is a classic Ugly Duckling story, and all girls feel like ugly ducks most of their adolescence.  Ann Hathaway is perfect as the gawky teen who becomes a princess.  And Julie Andrews gives us a regal, yet warm and caring grandmama/queen. This is a movie that has aged well.  A wonderful cast, including Holly Hunt, George Clooney, and John Goodman.  The parallel with Ulysses is clever if a bit beyond us less well-read viewers.  And the music...!  I did buy the sound track, I love listening to Gillian Welch and Allison Krause since those old-timey songs. A T-bone Burnett masterpiece. My daughter liked this movie a little more than I did - but I found it entertaining.  Diesel is good in this role as a tough guy having to get in touch with his nurturing side.

The movie is well done and entertaining. I have watched this a few times, and see more each time.  Being raised Jewish in the 1970s helps one to appreciate the humor.  But it is also is an Everyman tale which crosses cultures and generations.  Highly recommended. This is a movie my 8-year-old likes to watch over and over.  It is fun to watch the kids play mean tricks on Jackie Chan - and then find out how cool he really is.  Lots of fun stunts and over-the-top bad guys also. This movie is disappointing.  Isabelle is such a whiner!  Most of these movies are inspirational stories about girls overcoming obstacles to realize their dreams.  Isabelle does realize her dream, but she feels so sorry for herself through the process that we were hoping she would just go away. Good escapist flick for a Friday night rental.  Colin Firth is smooth and dangerous.  His young trainee holds his own with Firth.  Samuel Jackson is a little annoying - but he is supposed to be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1BHCE2409B5QF," Wonderful. I loved the book since I was a child and when i saw version of Jane Eyre with Timothy Dalton, I didn't think anything could top that. However, this one is fabulous as well. Ciaran Hinds is perfect as Mr. Rochester. After seeing this movie I became a big fan of his. If you like good love stories this is a must see. This is without a doubt the best movie John Woo has ever made. Chow Yun Fat is wondeful and if you are a fan(and I am!) you have to see it!  By the way, in another John Woo movie ""Face/Off"" there are some of the same elements as in the ""Killer"". Watch the action scenes carefully and you'll see. However, Nicolas Cage is no Chow Yun Fat. I do not like Jane Austin books. I read several and was bored out of my mind. Now, having said that I absolutely adore the movies that are based on her books. I guess I just like the stories but not her style of writing. This is a great love story and since I like Ciaran Hinds this was very enjoyable. However, if you don't like long movies and english accents, I advise against it. I know everybody is raving about it but I think you have to be a child(or a child at heart) to enjoy it. I liked this sort of stories when i was seven but that was a long time ago. I have to say that I was never a horror movie fan but The Ring has creeped me out. The pace is a little slow but story, while not superior, is still pretty interesting to watch. Warning: Do not watch before going to bed! This movie was actually a lot of fun to watch. (to my surprise, since I'm a chic flick opponent and a die hard action movie fan). It was funny and cute and I think suitable for a whole family to watch. This is the best cop show around. I have to say that every episode I'm literally glued to the screen. I trully wish that there was cops like Vic in real life because they could actually make a difference. Instead, real life cops have to deal with polically correct b.s. I truly enjoyed the first season and although, this one was good as well, I'm getting tired of constantly seeing Jack on the wrong side of the law. I mean, just once, can't he work with CTU unstead of creeping around because somebody in his life is in danger again? If you like to look at Angelina Jolie(who is truly stunning) this is the movie for you. If you like to be entertained and don't want to be bored out of your mind, you might want to pass this one. Beyond stupid. I'm a big fan of action movies but I like somewhat realistic stuff. This...Too much animation, bad acting(just like one of the reviewers said) and whole thing appeared to have been written by a 12 year old boy. Jackie Chan is funny but all his movies are the same. Plus, they get worse every year. This one takes the cake-I can't remember last time i was this bored. This is his worst movie to date. May be he should retire. As in many Hong Kong movies story is just ok but none the less this is a very stylish movie to watch. The girls are gourgeous, dressed to kill and perform their fights as if it was ballet. However, if you are expecting anything more than that you'll be dissapointed. First season wasn't too bad but after that it just went downhill. Plot is so ridiculous at this point that its downright hilarious. At this point, I'm watching it just so I can laugh at the stupidity of it. Tries to be La Femme Nikita(the show) and fails miserably. P.S. If I hear any more of that Rumbaldi nonsense, I think I'm going to scream. Enough already! I really enjoyed it. I love historical movies of any kind and although this was a somewhat romanticized view of the historical events that occured, i still thought it was a very good film. I also bought the soundtrack-it was excellent. i couldn't belive my eyes when my order was cancelled by Amazon without any explanation. And when I couldn't find it anywhere else i was absolutely livid. Luckily i managed to find it on Half.com for reasonable price. Thank God!(especially since i heard that it may not get released at all) Poor imitation of the original. I quite liked the first Dirty Dancing but this doesn't even compare. Story is pretty boring and unless you are a teenage girl, this won't interest you much. Add the leading man who is a skinny kid and looks about 12, and the usual chanting of ""Revolution-good! Capitalism-bad!"" and you have the recepe for a something you don't want to bother with. I hated the ""sixth sense"" and I thought the ""Signs"" was even worse. To my amazement, I really enjoyed the ""Village"". This is very creepy and suspensful and it doesn't let up until the end. I guess its a matter of opinion since my husband was bored to tears through the whole thing. I couldn't believe it when i saw 3rd season being released so soon after the second. Hooray! My all time favorite show, no others even come close! If you've never watched it, buy it and stop watching Alias! I wasn't too thrilled with this movie. Story got somewhat boring at times and since i read the book and liked it, I expected something a little bit more fun. Overall, ok for a rainy day when you have nothing else to do. I didn't care for it at all. For an action movie this wasn't very entertaining. I read the book sometime ago and enjoyed it but the movie doesn't even come close. Matt Damon is a very poor choice for this role with this boy next door looks and bland personality. I also don't know what's with the ridiculous role that Julia Stiles was playing, it was very annoying. Don't bother. this is very creepy movie made even more so by the fact that its based on a true story. If you don't belive in God and the Devil, by the end of this movie you may change your mind. This is my favorite show and without a doubt the most interesting one I've ever seen. I loved the chemistry between Michael and Nikita and so incredibly dissapointed when it was taken off the air. I wish people wouldn't compare it to Alias because Alias is nothing more than silly knock-off. Watch the real thing! Unlike many other shows that are based on the book, this particular one follows the storyline very closely and the show itself is absolutely fantastic. The actors playing the two main characters are great matches for the characters in the book. I cannot wait for future seasons Unlike many other shows that are based on the book, this particular one follows the storyline very closely and the show itself is absolutely fantastic.

AC32305TO79HL," To this day, Monty Python remains THE idol and source of inspiration to humourists all around. Monty Python's Flying Circus made the group famous, and it is the best ever to come out, not only from Monty Python, not only from Britain... but humour in general! Highlights on this tape: The Ministry Of Silly Walks, The Spanish Inquisition, Flying Lessons/Hijacked Plane (To Luton), 'The Bishop', Accidents Sketch and Registry Office. Own it! 'The Holy Grail' is less consistent and more slapstick than 'Life Of Brian'. It's more like a series of sketches linked together by facts'n'fun from British history. Highly entertaining as always, far out, sometimes provoking, and certainly politically incorrect. But that's exactly what makes 'The Holy Grail' a very funny, respectless film! Watching The Gold Rush, I understand why Chaplin had trouble achieving a breakthrough in Britain. The humour in the film is very unsophisticated, at times even ridiculous. Chaplin has had 4 or 5 ideas for 'funny' situations, and has then tried to link them together to a film. A few of the situations are a bit funny, but the film as a whole is not funny at all. It is interesting to watch Monty Python live. This performance gives quite a different effect than the studio series - for good and for worse. A big plus is the enthusiasm of the USAmerican fans, who can take just everything and even cheer for more and more. A few of the sketches do not work out perfectly on stage though. Still, Monty Python Live At The Hollywood Bowl makes you roll over laughing, as usual. All 12 episodes of the British comedy series Fawlty Towers! I fell for it'n' bought it, as a huge fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus. But  Fawlty Towers is not the same kind of humour. It is more slapstick  (without BEING slapstick), yet more complex since there's a continuous rise  towards total chaos climax at the end of each episode! This is great!  Great, and great FUN! Do buy the whole set - you will not cheat yourself! No-no. Apart from the sketch in the laundry, this tape is simply not funny. The minigolf sketch contains ONE joke... which is repeated 20 times, and the hospital and Queen's guard sketches are below mediocre. Goodbye, Mr Bean. This tape is among the better in the Mr Bean collection. The Exam and The Church are in fact really brilliant, while the other sketches are more mediocre. The short bonussketch in The Library is pretty good, though. Main drawback is that they've only put one single hour of entertainment on one entire video tape which makes it expensive and takes up space on your video shelf!

Main drawback is that they've only put one single hour of entertainment on one entire video tape which makes it expensive and takes up space on your video shelf! Allen is beginning to see life in a positive way. This comedy says so much about life in general and about parental relations, geniusly put into a modern-life context, and with satirical references to ancient Greek theater  and philosophy. Woody Allen's done it again! A splendid comedy. About life! I guess this one needs no further presentation. It is the best dramatic comedy since Nuns On The Run, perfectly combining British humour with an exciting story of crime, lies, intrigues, love... and animal torture! If  you haven't seen it yet, JUST DO SO! NOW! This movie has a lot of good attempts. Attempts for stories, side-stories, and some very good acting too. It's very melancholic, unsnobbishly philosophic, and very sad too. But somehow, you've seen it all before  (except of the young child killing his sisters and committing suicide). I wonder when I'll ever understand any other David Lynch film than 'The Straight Story'. 'Lost Highway' is a very typical Lynch film: lots of alternative filming and effects, lots of interesting music - it's often like one long music video, really - and lots of beautiful Patricia Arquette. But the story, hmmm... is as usual not for people with normal IQs. Well, it's not Scream but it comes close. This new combination of teenage entertainment and tomato ketchup horror is a worthwhile genre. Gorgeous chicks, cool blokes, stupid policemen, and journalists without any  sense of reality and humanity. All in all: the turn of the  century... Definitely entertaining. Definitely worth the money. I was just a young teenie when Gremlins came out and turned into a huge success. I enjoyed it very much back then, and today, I still enjoy watching this Classic once in a while. It has just everything that a film should have. Excitement, thrills, love, friendship, evil versus good, and not least: humour! Furthermore, Gremlins is very well made. Don't miss this film! It's one of those that you simply have to have seen. A true classic!! I guess this one needs no further presentation. It is the best dramatic comedy since Nuns On The Run, perfectly combining British humour with an exciting story of crime, lies, intrigues, love... and animal torture! If  you haven't seen it yet, JUST DO SO! NOW! This ""amateur"" movie is simply brilliant. Refreshingly different. Sublime acting which is almost too realistic. The artistic effects are so simple they're genius. And the movie shows how subjective a  camera is - you feel claustrofobically imprisoned inside the borders of the  very screen, so you sit'n'think: No! Look over there instead! THERE!. An  experience! (But of course it is much much better on the big screen!) The Sixth Sense is a thrilling movie. An emotional movie. A moving movie. Kind of even a philosophical movie. Although it is pretty predictable, and the story brings no surprises and no side-plots, it is  well-told and very well filmed. And the boy plays absolutely brilliant! A  great up and coming talent!

This is amazing: The lives of two life-enjoying teenage girls is torn apart from one second to the other. And still, they keep up spirit for months!

Own it! This is more like a long video on MTV than a horror movie. Pseudo effects, pseudo scary, pseudo manuscript. And no story at all!

I don't know if this is meant to be a comedy, a love story, or maybe yet another of those pseudo-moralizing movies. No matter what it is, it just doesn't work. Nurse Betty is stuffed with clichs and there is far between the good laughs. The only plus is Rene Zellweger's not just good but amazing acting. She's so natural, so human.

Episode Five is one of the best episodes ever. The highlights of Episode Six include The Dull Life Of A City Stockbroker. Own it! This is definitely not one of the best Mr Bean tapes. It basicly consists of some everyday situations to which Mr Atkinson's sketches do not really succeed to add a little spice. Avoidable without consequences. This Mr Bean tape does contain some good ideas, and the sketches are maybe even well-written and well-structured... but in fact, they are not that funny! Basicly a waste of money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3U8J6HOIYKIFM," I missed this on public TV and and very happy that we have the opportunity to purchase the long running show on a DVD. Excellent story line and excellent acting. I know you will be glued to the TV to watch each episode. I purchsed the movie because I just love the music. I was disappointed and bored with the story. But I will always like the background  music. On the other hand, mydaughter looked at the same move and like it very much, so there you go.  Different strokes for different folks. The movie is okay, but would not put it as a real favorite. Thought t was a bit slow. Good acting, but I wasn't enthusiastic about the story line. Wouldl not want to watch it a second time. A very compelling movie.  A good movie to curl up with and just relax. Highly recommend it to others and certainly recommend the Seller. Prompt ship and send a quality product. Recommend seeler to All. Just could not get into the m ovie. Tried several times, but frankly I was bored. Almost over acted by Maggie Smith.  Will send it to  my daughter for her opinion.  I just stopped it and put it away,, as I was bored. This was a gift, so I have not seen the movie. But the recipient says she enjoyed it very much and especially the wonderful British actor Maggie Smith. Will be looking forward to seeing it, when my daughter finishes watching the movie. A good remebrance of this wonderful TV show and the ""Columbo"" character. I had fogotten what a find actor Peter Falk was. One of my favorites, then and Now. Bought three seasons and will enjoy them, I am sure. Wish we had good TV shows like this now. So...if you really want to see GOOD TV buy this and others like it. A very good movie, but a bit slow for my taste. Acting and story line is very good and others may like it better. A bit slow and I couldn't stay interested in it. Daughter really likes it. Beautiful and sweet music and what a loss to the world when she died. I ordered one for me and one for my daughter and we both are so very pleased. A good movie...not my favorite Anthony Hopkins, but a good movie on a cold night with a bowl of popcorn.  I strongly recommend the Seller, who send a quality product and in a very prompt fashion. I barely placed the order until my daughter said it had arrived. This movie surprised me. When I started watching it I thought it was boring. For lack of anything else to watch, I keep watching and the longer I watched the more I wanted to see. It is great and well done. I didn't like one of the characters, but we can't always get everything. Try it and see what life was like years ago. Very good movie,.  Wish it had more substance. Mostly was about the time when Johnny Cash was on drugs. I never knew he had such an addition.  So glad he got it together and married June and we all were able to enjoy their music. I only watched a portion of the movie. It did not hold my attention and so loaned it to  my daughter. I thought the half I watched was a little slow. Don't think my daughter has watched it yet. Frankly, I was disappointed with the DVD. I expected Show Stoppers to mean different TV shows. Instead, mostly they talk to their audience about how they were laughing at each other, then show a five minute clip of the thing that made them laugh. I found this DVD BORING! I very very sweet movie about a very lonely man.  It is well done and of course, the acting by Robin Williams is excellent. A sad ending, but predictable.  I thought anyone would like the movie. This is a good movie, but one I only wish to see one time. Sorta a dark side to it, but this is my impression. Also has a saddness quality. Seller shipped very prompt and item in great condiiton. REcomment the seller to all. Haven't watched this yet, as loaned to daughter. I remember the story lines and plots of Columbo and don't enjoy so much seeing them, as there is no suspense.  I don't think I missed many Columbo's when on TV. Try it and you will love him. Movie seems silly in today's world. Just watched about ten minutes and knew this wasn't as expected. Did not want to spend my time watching something that was boring to  me. Very interesting and a wonderful look back at the 70's. Brought back a lot of memories. Didn't know men were jumping in and out os women's beds like Don Draper. This was the only part I didn't care for. Would have rather he was a faithful husband to his beautiful wife. But she is very childlike. Very interesting and a wonderful look back at the 70's. Brought back a lot of memories. Didn't know men were jumping in and out os women's beds like Don Draper.

Oh my, what a story and the lead actress is WONDERFUL.  Have sure enjoyed this great, great movie and urge all to purchase a copy. So very well done and it moves right along from one chapter to another. Am now watching it a second time, as I sometime get  sleepy and drop off while watch a  movie. This is so- o - o GOOD.  I highly recommend and she sure was a character in real life. Disappointed in this movie.  It just was not up to Michael Kitchen standards and in one chapter, he has no part. I grade the movie about a two. Sorta silly ending. A great TV program and each week looked forward to seeing the next chapter. Was disappointed that Joh Hamm went from woman to woman. Otherwise, it was exactly like the time period and this was interesting to watch. This was  not the right movie for me, but my daughter, who is much younger than me, really enjoyed it. I think I like a different type of movie. Maggie Smith as always is perfect in all her performances. A wonderful portrayal of life in the 70's and brought back a lot of memories. Don't think Men was hopping in and out of women's beds as much a Don Draper. This was the only part I didn't like bout the series. Sadly as it moves along toward the end, it isn't as good. Looked forward each Sunday evening for the next episode....Great programing, and an accurate portrayal of the 70's. Great series. Wished Don Draper had a more ""grown up"" wife. She acted like a child from time to time and one got the idea she didn't like to be a Mother. This is sad to see. She constantly treated her daughter and son with less than ""Mother Love."" I am still in Part One and am enchanted with this WONDERFUL DVD SERIES.  highly recommend to everyone who likes British movies. This series is spelll-binding.  Broke away long enough to write my joy with having this Outstanding DVD.  Thanks to all who encouraged me to buy, based on their comments. This sure helps to carefully make a good purchase. Wish I had figured this out earlier. Excellent movie and of course the star is  Christopher Kitchen. A dynamic movie and you just  can't guess what will come next. I thoughtrough enjoyed it and highly recommend it to all. A wonderful movie for a long winter day. Movies are just too old and too slow. Very boring to sit thru. Checked out 2 or 3, buy are not used to the early classics.  If you like these, then you will really enjoy.  Even the cartoons are really silly and old. Program is still captivating, but moving a little slower than in the earlier programs. Also can't understand why Don Draper was made to look like a skirt chaser. Seems it just about destroyed  his career. Think the woman who played his wife seemed ""childess"" and not even sited to her new important husband. She sure doesn't like to be a Mother. You will enjoy revisiting the 70's time, and the writers seem to stay true to that time. Extremely disappointed with the movie. The movie could stand alone, and did not need the constant profanity. Just made me sick and I will never watch this again. Another DVD to donate to the GoodWill. I had no idea such fowl language would be used. Just made me sick, not for myself, but for so many young people who will watch this PUKE!!! Excellent and what more can I say. Pefect acting, good sound quality and you are wanted to keep going, even as it ends to go on to Chapter 8. Thanks so much Mr. Foyle!!! An acting job well done. DVD not in English. I only understand the English Language. Had no idea this was in another language. Cost to return more than original cost; will donate to GoodWill. Thank you. The classic movie is wonderful and I can't wait until the 3rd season comes out.  It is truly a delightful story and so well acted. I understand it will be about January before episode three is on Public TV. You will so enjoy it, I guarantee!! Wonderful Wonderful!!!  Oh how I wish they had continued on for at least Four Seasons.  We are left to guess how their lives might have turned out. But I think all in all, it was a great two season presentation. I so like this Series ""The Paradise"" TWO.  However unable to sit in the computer chair for one hour at a time, so I don't enjoy it as much as I would  like. I hope it will be reissued in the current of the USA.  This is one of the finest of Masterpiece TV programs, second only to Downton Abbey.  Try season 1 if you have not done so. You will surely enjoy it. Boring  film and lacking in depth.  I will keep it, but dispointed. Kate Winslet was the drawing card, but not a good role for her. Sad  her talent was not used ina better pictures.  Hd hoped for a more indepth story line. Magnificient and captivating Movie. It is almost a one man show, with Michael Kitchen really carrying the load. He is such a good performer and this as when he was a very young man. Oh my...his blue eyes. Highly recommend to everyone..you will want to see it  more than once. A world class movies and  I watch it at least once a year. What a tragedy..all  because someone wanted to break some kind of record . Instead many thousands of people died and for  no reason than carelessness. Acting is very very well done. Music is so sweet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AG0YGPDVFX3NO," I'm not through with the complete series, but am into the end of the 3rd season and am enjoying it. I must admit that I have a problem with the accents of a few of the characters, but the plots are masterful and I see why it was an award winner. I was a huge fan of Leslie Nielsen's comedy. He was so handsome that he could have been a leading man in serous roles. But, thankfully, he chose comedy, where he excelled. Take everything scary you've seen about Dracula and turn it in to comedy and that's ""Dead and Loving It"". I have seen it before, but it had been many years and I still think it is hilarious.  Light comedy and Nielsen never disappoints. Patsy Cline, in my estimation, was the greatest woman country-western singer who ever lived. The fact that she died so young in that airplane crash took away a great talent. I'd bet she could have been singing well into her senior years and not have lost a thing from her outstanding voice.  It is too bad that Charlie Dick lived up to his last name.  He didn't make her life any easier, that's for sure. Great movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor showing both sides, American and Japanese. Usually, I don't like subtitles, but these make it authentic when the Japanese speak. It wouldn't have been as believable if it had been all spoken in English. I like history, so have watched this more than once. Hitchcock, Grace Kelly, Ray Milland, Bob Cummings,  and the entire cast of Dial M for Murder were just excellent. I have seen this movie so many times that I can practically say the sentence right along with the actor. But, good acting and a good plot never grow old. This movie could stand up to today's mysteries and rise above them for acting, content and suspense.  One of the all-time great views. Have you ever seen Dustin Hoffman give a bad performance whether as Tootsie, in Little Big Man or in this, his first movie, The Graduate? He and Anne Bancroft play off each other perfectly. It couldn't have been cast any better.  And, of course, there is the bonus of hearing Simon and Garfunkel sing some great songs throughout the movie. ""Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?"" Great and memorable line. And by the way, she was. I bought 2 DVD's of this movie to see which I liked the best. I really couldn't decide, as both have parts that the other doesn't have and yet, they are similar.  One is black and white, the other, color. To me, the black and white version was more frightening and eerie. They followed Capote's book well. Truman Capote is well known for writing ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and ""In Cold Blood"", but much wasn't known about his life or how he came to write ""In Cold Blood"". This movie gives some insight into the person of Capote though it could have gone on for awhile longer and I wished that it had covered more of his youth and how he came to prominence as a writer of non-fiction crime. I watched this on YouTube and loved it so much that I ordered it on Amazon. This is something I'll watch over and over again and enjoy every time. What a great tribute. As much as I love Harry Connick's singing, his was the only song I didn't care for. He did it in his style, not George's. Sometimes, country is best left to those who feel it. This is well worth owning. I know this is touted as a great movie and maybe it would be if I were a kid. But, after all of these years and never having seen it and the movie that came out about Disney's making it, my curiosity was peaked and I ordered it. Frankly, I could hardly wait for it to be over. Though in black and white, the plot and characters seem just as down to earth and real as can be. Anyone having dealt with a loved one with dementia, makes this movie hit home. The actors should have all won an award for presenting a heart-warming view of a problem many families face. I would highly recommend this. This is a great series. The ""new"" DSI Barnaby is as good as the former DSI, John Nettles..different styles, both in detecting and in their homes lives. The writers of this series do a great job with different plots, never giving away ""who done it"" until almost the very last. I'm hooked on this series and enjoy it on our local Public Broadcasting System on Thursday nights.  This and ""Foyle's Wars"" are the best, I believe. I think this is one of Hitchcock's best movies. It scared me and I did figure out the murderer towards the end of the movie.  I can easily recommend it to those who still like a great plot and good acting with Doris Day and Rex Harrison. Another great movie by Hitchcock. Perhaps, his best.  The plot is great, the actors, believable and it keeps you guessing right up to the end as to what's happening. The only thing I was puzzled about was McDonald Carey as a love interest for the heroine.  He looked much, much too old for her.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1LT1B85ZQYRH8," I was expecting this to be wonderful from the reviews, but due to the wretched moral values of many of the Upstairs people I had a hard time enjoying the story.  A few of the Downstairs people had difficulties, too, but they in general set better standards of conduct.  Wish I could sell my copy. Very slow.  I thought it would never get around to something interesting.  The marriages portrayed had major problems.  However it did end quite well.  I would not watch it a second time. There isn't a finer actress than the star of this movie, but I couldn't get interested in it.  I wouldn't watch it again.  Would like to sell it back to Amazon. I have every one of the Persuasion offerings I could find.  I think this is the most believable with the characters being what I would consider to be the right age for the parts they played.  Very interesting to see how a misguided friend can cause so much trouble in a relationship. The acting is superb.  Very interesting story and characters.  All classes of people were shown in this small town.  I have watched it over and over.  Well worth the price.  Did not care as much for the sequel.  Too many of the original characters were not there.  It was sad to see how much things had changed. The acting is superb.  Very interesting story and characters.  All classes of people were shown in this small town.  I have watched it over and over.  Well worth the price.  Did not care as much for the sequel.  Too many of the original characters were not there.  It was sad to see how much things had changed. Many of the interesting characters from the main series were not there anymore.  It was very sad.  While I very highly recommend ""Cranford"" I regret that I cannot do the same for ""The Return."" I enjoyed this version of Jane Eyre.  I would have liked it to be a little longer than it was.  The violin music was absolutely wonderful.  Very good acting.  Believable story. Good story, fine acting for the most part.  BUT, I must say that I did not like the frequent display of immoral conduct.  The repulsive minister who thought his perversions and absolute disrespect for his wife were within his rights as a husband were unbelievable.  It is sad that an otherwise good story was degraded by added garbage. I have loved other Charles Dickens movies so I was anxious to see this one, too.  There are so many interesting twists and turns in the story.  You see the contrasts between the good, the bad and the ugly!  My husband didn't like it, but I did so I only gave it 4 stars. My husband and I have been watching several BBC/Masterpiece movies. The Paradise is absolutely the best.  Shall I admit we have watched it 3 times since purchasing it a month ago? The acting is superb and the characters are believable.  It is impossible not to get involved with the story.  Can't wait until the next season is out. This movie showed the best and the worst in people during war in Germany.  It is frightening to see how people can follow a ruthless and misguided leader, causing the tragic destruction of lives and property.  Seeing the hope in a seemingly hopeless situation was very inspiring.  There can still be goodness in the midst of evil.  I will certainly watch this again.  I purchased this at Costco, but it is $5 less at Amazon! This was certainly worth watching.  It was very sad to see how much importance was placed on money and position when choosing a marriage partner among the aristocrats in England.  I'm not going to go into details of the story, but I thoroughly enjoyed this--much more than Upstairs Downstairs.  Yes, the picture quality was a little lacking, but certainly adequate for me.  Will watch it again in a few months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A30YL0GGBB8U7K," It really does. OK, it was filmed forty years ago, so the odd wobbly wall etc, but if you don't fall in love with the well-written characters and evocation of Edwardian London you are not human. The screenwriter should be taken out and shot. How dare she rewrite Edith Wharton thinking she could do better. You end up with a hopelessly flawed mini-series. The locations and costumes save it from one star - just. But IF YOU LIKED THE BOOK THEN I BEG YOU NOT TO WATCH THIS TRAVESTY. If you found the central character annoying in the book, you will want to strangle her in this version, but not until you've brushed her hair. The movie gets better as it goes on after a very weak start. As usual with Austen, the main characters fall for each other on the weakest impression. You can see in this movie how wrong-footed Hollywood was in the fifties by the onslaught of Television. Dumbed down compared to any movie of the previous two years, a silly script combines with ludicrous costumes to make this a joke. The two stars are wheeled out as contrived sex symbols, bordering on soft porn. Really terrible - the hand held camera, the ludicrous over-acting, the self-centred, unpleasant characters. It's ""off the wall lunacy"" may suit the more self-indulgent students of the art of cinema, or act simply as a diversion for tired palattes, but to me it felt like unconvincing torture. Something made by teenage amateurs, for teenage amateurs. Avoid. Very interesting attempt, almost unique I'd say, to recreate the faboulousness of a banquet in Louis XIV's  time. Strong caste who don't always gel together. The unpleasant spoillt aristocrats, and the Royal family, are all English. Depardieu, the much put upon and very French Master Steward at a French chateau. Very tongue in cheek adaptation of the Wooster novels, but several things to annoy real Wooster fans. The inevitable conflation of novels, reduces Woodhouse's complex layers of subtle humour to pure slapstick. In addition many novels set in the inevitable English country house setting, are instead transposed to New York with inevitable loss of meaning. Having said this the top two - Jeeves and Wooster both give excellent performances, but this is not for the discerning Wooster fan. I had heard of this and was aware of its long ago cult status, but goodness me this is good. Well written, well played and well directed. It is such a shame that it is in Black & White, but the careful study of upper middle class Victorian mores is priceless. Outstanding period drama. A continuing thread runs through the two series, but each episode is almost stand alone, with top class writing and acting. Some of them are simply outstanding - particularly the Monica and Clive vignettes as others have mentioned. Some very real and controversial themes tackled - high drama. The change of two leading actors was clearly a mistake in Series Two, but there is so much else to feast on, one can look through it. Outstanding period drama.

Subtle humour reduced to the most basic slapstick. Innuendos made blaring statements. All of it abbreviated beyond belief.  I beg you to avoid this and read the books. I cannot tell  you the disappointment when we were half way through Jamaica Inn and the film suddenly skipped to the end. Useless. What do you do - buy another copy? This was only the second movie we watched in the collection. It quite puts you off even trying with the others. We got a refund, but what a waste of time. No need these days for faulty goods to be sold like this. Had never heard of this before, but I loved this querky, addictive series. A must for anyone who loves country houses, Victoria, and grand cooking. My only complaint was that each episode was too short and it was hard to get enough detail in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2GIJVZJ928QYA," We wondered what all the fuss was about. A forty year old series?! The quaint black and white pictures and simplistic sets in the first episodes recede from your consciousness as the stories draw you in. Before long, you have a vested interest in the lives of these people and the history they are living becomes vivid - and feels current. We missed them when we finished viewing and will watch it again. If you need subtitles (or just have trouble with this accent) be aware that although the website says this series is closed captioned, it is not. We tried to watch but my husband has difficulty hearing (thus the purchase of only closed captioned DVDs) and I confess, the accent made it difficult for me to understand too. We will be returning this set. My daughter has been doing yoga for years but had stopped for months and wanted something she could do at home when she had a bit of time. She found this set to have everything she wanted and needed. She was very happy with it. What a lovely series. And what a nice antidote to current politics. This is a typical, gentle English series with nice story lines and excellent actors - some of whom you will recognize from Downton Abbey and Call the Midwife among other British shows. Like ""Deathly Hollows, Part 1"", this moive is dark - visually and contextually (is that a word?). Of course the book was better but the movie was so visually stunning. Tied up all the loose ends. These characters, who have been our ""friends"" for so many years will be missed. Ian McShane is a brilliant actor. We'd bought ""Deadwood"" and, even though we knew the show to be completely different, we assumed it would be the same quality. They had fine actors but the scripts fell short. The actors hadn't much to work with. Very disappointing - not to mention expensive. We have binge watched this series as an antidote to the political news. Very enjoyable; lovely countryside and village scenes, good acting and story lines. Why is it the British can make these kinds of series so much better than we? Recognizable actors from Downton Abbey, Poldark, Call the Midwife and other great English shows. We have loved the episodes of Midsomer Murders since we discovered them and now own every set available. The series features wacky &/or great characters,unique plots with superb actors and each is set in the beautiful English countryside. Not a place you would want to live, as there is a very high mortality rate, but charming and lovely nonetheless. The entire series with John Nettles as Tom Barnaby is worth your time and money. We've bought them all and love the characters. You will see every English actor of any note in a cameo role in one of the Midsomer episodes. This is a truly wonderful series of shows, brilliantly scripted and acted and set in the beautiful scenery of the English countryside. We love it! Lovely movie. I'd seen it with my daughter but wanted to share it with my husband - I knew he'd love it. Wonderful story, excellent script, the best character actors and amazing scenery. I know we'll watch it again... This Midsomer Murder includes the  introduction to Tom Barnaby's (John Nettles') replacement in the series, his cousin John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon). Hate to see Tom go! We have all the series - they are great fun and beautifully done in the spectacular English countryside. Each murder is unique (putting it mildly) and you'll see every character actor you've ever known in at least one segment of the series' many stories. This was good but we are having a hard time replacing dear John Nettles and family with Neil Dudgeon in our affections. In addition to the amazing variety of murders by all sorts of strange (and some common) means, the relationships among the members of the Barnaby""family"" added to the show tremendously. It is still a good show but I think we'll give it up when Jason Hughes leaves. Neil Dudgeon is a good actor but no one can compare to John Nettles' Tom Barnaby and the ensemble which preceded Dudgeon's takeover of lead character. The writing isn't as good and the characters lack the magic - chemistry? - of the older episodes. We'll keep purchasing these because they are still better than most of our TV shows. A bit of a disappointment. We love the English shows for their fine acting and beautiful scenery. My recommendation would be to skip this set and buy instead the early Midsomer Murder series or even Pie in the Sky. Just love this series. We've watched it on TV and have bought all the seasons to watch again and again. Such a masterpiece: great acting and writing, scenery, clothes. Love it! It's still a good series but I really miss Tom Barnaby (John Nettles), Joyce (Jane Wymark), his wife and George (Barry Jackson) the coroner. I'll still watch and will continue to buy the Midsomer Murders but the love is gone... It will never be as good as the older Midsomers with John Nettles. They have lost something with the transition to Neil Dudgeon - not that he isn't a fine actor but the chemistry isn't there. Still one of the best series available. We miss John Nettles and Jason Hughes but this was better than anything on TV! We will probably order more of this series. The story lines are not as consistently wonderful as previous sets of this series but the English countryside settings and quirky characters remain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ADKKDZGDVEVWZ," I took a chance on this movie as I had never seen it. I found it to be actually fun and exciting and edgy. George c Scott never disappoints. I recommend this for anyone who likes a good ghost story. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a wonderful story. It touches on dysfunction very well and a lot going for it. Not only is it a great story, it is well directed and well cast. Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman are terrific and Burl Ives is powerful as the head of the family! A must see for anyone who likes a good drama with intrigue. I purchased this movie for the wonderful cast that it had as well as the historical value of the pain France faced in 1940. The powerful cast of Bogart, Rains, Greenstreet and Lorre just ads to the fun of a great plot. A friend highly recommended this film to me. I took a chance and purchased it. I can not say I was highly disappointed but i cant say i loved it either. I suppose for its time it could be considered creepy but I really was expecting more from it. This is one of those films that had an interesting enough plot that a remake today could do it some serious justice. Madam X is by far one of the best soap opera type films ever created. The story touches all emotions and the all star cast is wonderful. A great twist that I never saw coming WOW! I heard about this movie from some one on facebook. I took a chance and purchased it. To my surprise I found this movie to be a valuable gem. A great story, great performances and a great cast. A must have for suspense lovers as well as Doris Day lover's. The Long Hot Summer is one of the steamiest films created for its time. The chemistry between Paul Newman and his wife Joanne Woodward was great on film and Orson Welles is superb! A great drama with a fantastic cast! I was very disappointed in this version. The performance of scrooge was weak. He didn't play grumpy and rotten very well. Just wasn't a great adaptation of such a wonderful story I love Bette Davis films and I did enjoy this one. Its not her best role but its certainly isn't her worst. Sometimes I think a movie just isn't directed in the way the writer really had it. This is by far one of the best films ever created for family television. Megan Follows is perfectly cast as Anne. An orphaned girl who is adopted by a spinster woman(Coleen Dewhurst) and her Bachelor Borther(Richard Farnsworth). Based in Prince Edward island Canada the story and the scenery is perfection at its best. This is truly a movie that should be on everyones family list of best films ever. I really liked the idea behind this movie but it just left me feeling blah. I think the idea behind this story was rather fun but the director fell short on directing the cast properly. It has its pro's but it also has it's cons. I wouldn't recommend anyone to see it but I wouldnt detour them either. I am just left sitting on the fense with this one. I saw this made for TV movie years ago. Valerie Berinelli was powerful in her roll as a woman touched with mental illness. In some scenes you actually think you are dealing with a woman who struggles with reality. Valerie was a strong actress in this movie and I was really pulled into the story once again. For all of you who liked ""What's Happening"", ""What's Happening Now"" is just as fun. I really loved this sitcom and enjoyed watching it all over again. It was fun to see these guys older and getting themselves into more situations. Shirley is as fun as ever and Dwayne is just as adorable..... I purchased this movie because I have always liked Genie Francis. I enjoyed her so much on General Hospital in the 80's as Laura then in Bare Essence and North and South that i wanted to see more. This movie is a great thriller, it will keep you on edge and once again you cant help but love Genie Francis I have to say, I took a chance on this film. I had never seen it but I always did enjoy Dan Dailey as well as some of June Haver films. The story line was fun and cute but I can't help but wonder how much better this movie would have been if it starred Betty Grable instead of June Haver. But regardless it was still enjoyable I really enjoyed this mini series. I found it to pull me into the plot and the performances were really well done. I have always enjoyed the stories shared about World War II and this mini series has multiple stories wrapped into one. Great movie, great cast! I am not sure how I came across this movie but when I did I took a chance and ordered it. When I was placing it into my player I was expecting to be dissapointed. However, I found myself laughing, feeling and totally relating to the characters. This was truly a Great find and a beautiful gem of a movie. I love it Everything about this collection is A+. Rita Hayworth is magical and vivacious. The movies are a treat and all worth watching more then once. I wasn't overly impressed with Solome but it was entertaining in itself. The others were excellent and entertaining. I really enjoyed the idea behind this movie and though some of it was entertaining, it just seems as though the director just couldn't get it off the ground. It was entertaining for what it is but by no means is this a great movie. It has its fun but it has its cheese too, certainly not a ""horror"" movie but good enough to get one in the mood for Halloween time. Why did I get married too is a continuing story and in my opinion, as good(if not better)as the original. The story line was amazing and the actors again were right on their mark. Janet Jackson was gripping and powerful in her role. But OMG they were all great. This movie is fantastic, powerful and entertaining. I can not get enough of Tyler Perry's work. A must have for any movie collector. I enjoyed this story for the humor they placed on an over growing cultural behavior that is becoming more and more acceptable within our country. Why marry the cow when she gives her milk out for free? Of course they take the subject matter, make it a romantic comedy and give it a happily ever after ending so it becomes acceptable. Of course in all reality, it doesn't work out that way. What a great story, great performances but in my opinion it lacked emotion. Somewhere it the directing, something got lost. I wish they would remake this story and really play on the death more and build on the relationship of the little girl and the mans part to really capture the pain. I good sequel to the original. Though it is a free standing movie and can be watched without watching the 1st film, I found it to be rather edgy and gripping. Truly enjoyed this movie and the performances. How I loved this movie! It was a great flick about dysfunction, love and lust for people over 50. Robert Deniro is a riot when he plays in a good comedy and who can get beyond his face getting caught between...........(I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it)? OMG I almost fell over laughing. A fun movie that will keep you laughing I really did enjoy the plot to this good sequel. Though I was disappointed in a certain scene because of one of the characters deaths(wont ruin it for those who haven't seen it) I have to say the rest of the characters really pulled off this movie. Nothing better then a great action packed movie to keep one wide awake! Earlier Cagney films always cast him as a punchy Irish guy fighting his way to where ever he wanted to get. Taxi is no different. Cagney's earlier films helped mold him into the tough character actor that he became. If you are a fan of his like I am you will enjoy adding Taxi to your collection. Ok, is it a dark comedy, an action flick, a super hero flick?? Its all of the above really. There is nothing more pleasing in a movie then vigilante behavior especially when its the bad guys that are getting their just punishment. I have to say i love Hit Girl. He sarcasm and toughness is a hoot, that girl can kick some ass! A fun sequel I have to say i took a chance on this movie as I do enjoy sci-fi from time to time. Pacific Rim is a fun film with an interesting plot of a world trying to survive against the Aliens. I liked the plot, enjoyed the action as well as the special effects. Its not the best sci fi film out there but it is worth a view in my opinion. WOW, is all I can say about this season. I bought it as soon as it became available and watched the entire season in 2 days time. I loved it so much that i immediately watched it all over again. Season 4 is by far the best season to date. Julian Fellows is a Terrific writer with an amazing imagination. Thank you for the best show ever written for TV to date. Ok I have to admit Insidious really kept me on edge. When i saw that part II was coming out I was thrilled beyond belief. I really loved the way they pulled part one into part two and I loved the creepy atmosphere that part 2 had. I really have been enjoying the sequels as much as the originals lately and this is one of the sequels i really loved. I love Tyler Perry. I will start off stating that to the world. The man is a genius with his stories and picking the right performers to play his characters. I have not been disappointed in any of his movies. his comedies are hysterical and his dramas pull you in. The man is a genius and Temptation is just another movie that proves that. Keep them coming Tyler! The Croods was a fun movie with a lot of action and great humor. Its funny how they dive into family dysfunction and use ""cavemen"" as the characters. Thousands of years later we are still dysfunctional and haven't grown all that much no matter what some may believe. This is a great film with a great cast of voices What can one say to give this franchise any more credit? Iron Man is a great story line. Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast in the title role and the special effects always wow me. They keep getting better and lets hope that continues as I hate to see perfecting come crumbling down. I really did enjoy this movie. Now with special effects becoming so enhanced, I find they can make things seem so real. When a story can pull you into the fantasy and you can forget you are looking at special effects, then i say the entertainment factor is ""right on"". Sequels usually get a bum wrap but I have to say i really enjoyed this continuing story. I have to admit I really didn't think I was going to enjoy the Smurfs or The Smurfs II as much as I did. Its a fun way to just unwind and destress ones self. Neil Patrick Harris is a Hoot as well as Hank Azaria as ""Gargamel. Good plot, fun effects and cute acting by all. I really enjoyed Red so when they were coming out with part 2 I was thrilled. I went to see it as soon as possible at the theater and then on DVD I ordered it right away just so I could see it again. What a great cast they chose for this movie and its sequel and what a great plot. Kept me on edge and guessing the entire time. I good sequel to a good action movie! I love this show but the dvds have some serious issues. Its obvious its a Manufacturing issue and no one seems to be correcting it. It seems every other episode freezes and fails. I'm frustrated with this. As long as DVDS have been out there should be no issues. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this huge package. Fast and furious 6 was a great comeback after so many years. The plot was amazing and it really kept me involved and entertained. Its a shame Paul Walker had to die but Vin Diesel really is powerful in his role. A fun action packed story for all to enjoy. I really have enjoyed the story in Hunger games and now Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Jennifer Lawrence is a powerhouse in front of the camera and she really shows promise as a young star. Catching Fiore really kept me entertained and wanting for more. Exactly the way a sequel should be. I find myself anxious for Part 3 and can not wait. Well done to all involved. Abigail Breslin really did a remarkable job in this film. This is a good psychological thriller. There is no blood guts or gore so if you are a fan of slasher films then this one isn't for you. This is a ghost story, a haunting story and very well filmed, directed and acted. It really kept me entertained and intrigued. I liked the idea behind this plot. This movie Wowed me. I never saw the twist coming when it hit and I loved how the complexity of this story line pulled together at the end. Hugh Jackman was a powerhouse. I could feel his pain as a dad whose daughter disappears. the helplessness he was feeling and I could also understand the vigilante he becomes for the love of his daughter. A powerful and gripping story! I grew up with Laverne and Shirley and and for a TV sitcom this one was one of the best. It truly shows what true friendships are all about and taught some good life lessons. I was sad to see Edna not part of season 7 but alas things happen. I am so happy that I purchased this sitcom as it still holds up well after all these years. Nothing seems out dated. I enjoyed this story for the humor they placed on an over growing cultural behavior that is becoming more and more acceptable within our country. Why marry the cow when she gives her milk out for free? Of course they take the subject matter, make it a romantic comedy and give it a happily ever after ending so it becomes acceptable. Of course in all reality, it doesn't work out that way. I happened to come across this movie on amazon. The synopsis sounded so suspenseful and intriguing that I wanted to ad it to my collection. Unfortunately I found it to be drawn out and not suspenseful at all. It lacked luster and the performances were not on their game. I was somewhat disappointed. I purchased this movie on DVD because the synopsis sounded like something I would enjoy. After watching it I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. It was light and airy and well casted. June Allyson was adorable, Robert Walker was charming and Hedy Lamarr was lovley. I really loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone who just enjoys a good fairy tale movie every now and again! I heard of this story by a friend of mine. I bought it as I enjoyed the first 2 films. Part 3 goes back to the beginning. It was a good story and helped introduce the characters. Though it's not better then the 1st one, it is a good movie. Has edge and chills. I took a chance on this film as I never saw it before purchasing. I wanted an engaging story and I must admit I found it. Peter Lorre was amazing and his performance was right on mark. He is creepy and calculating, a perfect role for Peter. I have waited for years for this show to be released on DVD. When I saw it had become available, I was excited. I would stay up till 2am to watch the reruns of this show. Mo'Nique is brilliant and endearing in this show. I truly l9ve it and wish they'd make a come back...... Once again Ben Aflec truly knows how to bore the pants of of me. He should stick behind the camera cause he ruins everything he is in. Thankfully I read he will not be up for a Batman VS Superman 2. I was so disappointed in this flop This is one of those movies that you stumble across and are amazed at the story and the originality of it all. It reminds me of ""Face Off"" with John Travolta and Nicholas cage. It was gripping and powerful. A great action flick that truly captures your attention. Its a gem in its own right and I would recommend it to any movie lover who enjoys a movie for its ""story"" rather then its effects. I has never seen this 4 part mini series but I took a chance. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The movie grabbed me right away. The characters were realistic and the plot played with emotions. I was so happy that I took a chance I. This little unknown gem. I took a chance on this movie and I must say it really did entertain me. It was a sort of who done it flick. A sort of spy film that keeps you engaged and trying to figure out the plot. Robert Gant was great and Shannen Doherty was just as believable. Not a bad movie for those who like thrillers I have read that James Cagney did not care for this film but I have to say he must have been hard on himself as an artist. I thoroughly enjoy this story. A penniless sailor who ends up doing very well for himself through determination. Margaret Linsay is fantastic as well. Put the two of them together, and you have a great story with a fun plot. I never caught this show when it aired so I took a chance in ordering it. I have to say the first season was rather painful as it was awfully goody toe shoes for my tastes that I almost stopped watching it. Thankfully I can be stubborn because it started to take off and I have begun to appreciate the stories as well as the characters.......... This is a typical Claudette Colbert movie. Its fun and romantic. A story of a love triangle. He loves her, she loves him and he loves her. Does she pick the right guy or doesn't she? You will just have to buy the movie to find out. I really had fun with this movie and didn't see a certain plot within the plot happening until it was in my face. I purchased this movie because I knew that it was one of Marilyn Monroe's earlier movies. The dvd synopsis even mentioned she was in ithe but uncredited. For all Marilyn fans, don't be duped. She IS NOT in this dvd. They deleted her scene on the DVD. the movie itself wasn't bad but I rated it based on the false hood and using Marilyn's name to sell the product. I was so excited when this DVD was released. Though I never saw it, I truly do love Bette Davis and George Brent together. this film was fun and enjoyable. Have to love competition in the work force LOL I love Clark Gable and I have collected all his films so far. I think he truly has done some great characters but this movie left me wanting it to be over and done with. I was bored and struggling to find this story interesting. I happened to come across this movie by accident. I had never heard of it and took a chance on it to find myself pleasantly surprised. It was edgy and dark and kept me fully engaged. It had a great twist that I really didn't see coming and found myself wowed! Not many movies can surprise me these days but Flight 7500 truly did.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A28V2ZCVGKTKGI," I loved the original series and wanted to add it to my DVD collection.  Finally got a terrific price buying on Amazon.  Was purchased ""used"" for a very reasonable price and was in condition like new.  Looking forward to many enjoyable hours watching this classic British series. Kind of ""old fashioned"" given the films of today but this is still a favorite.  Enjoyed it the first time I saw it and really enjoyed seeing it again after so many years. I remember watching this series on the television when I was younger.  I enjoyed it them and was happy to watch again.  I have always enjoyed ""period pieces"" and this is one of the best when it comes to Henry VIII.  A welcome addition to my DVD library. OK I admit it......I love this movie.......loved the book and it reminds me of my ""younger years"".........and to think THIS film was considered racey!  Love the hairstyles, clothes and the drama.  For us ""boomers""........this film is a ""trash treat"" Need I say more----has Denzel EVER made a bad movie??  This is fabulous from start to finish and I must admit that Russell Crowe does a terrific job. Added this to the private collection. Need I say more----has Denzel EVER made a bad movie??  This is fabulous from start to finish and I must admit that Russell Crowe does a terrific job. Added this to the private collection. Saw this series on PBS years ago and fell in love with the story, the costumes, the sets......  Have watched the price on Amazon and was able to get it for 1/2 the price used.  Perfect discs.......played beautifully.  Saved money and was able to add a real favorite to my home collection. What more can I say --- it's Barbara Stanwyck!  Love all of her films ~ from when she was young and continuing throughout a long and successful career.  Comedy or Drama parts -- she could do it all.  Happy to have this set in my collection. This is part of a wonderful collection that we purchased.......and will be enjoying for many years to come.  Wonderful cast, costumes, special effects and story lines.  Great entertainment --- for adults. Had to get this for our home collection.  We have loved Laurel & Hardy for many years and this is a terrific collection of a large part of their best work.  Includes a few extra surprises also.  Many many hours of entertainment to come.... Purchased the entire series.  So well done, and will be viewed many times.  Wonderful costumes, scenery, special effects, story lines........but best of all -- the incredible cast.  Definitely one for the home collection. Part of a terrific series that is definitely for adults.  There are many adult themes but the costumes and ""sets"" are amazing.  The cast did a wonderful job portraying their characters and it was easy to get into the different story lines.  Bought this series for our home collection because we enjoyed it so much and it is perfect for ""marathon watching :)!"" I was ""hooked"" by the end of the first episode and haven't miss one since.  Anyone, who follows this terrific series can understand why I want to add Season 4 to my collection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AAR430IXGTGJG," This complete series starts in 1903 and ends in 1920, featuring a family who lived in a great house in England ~ the lives of the people living upstairs and the completely different lives of those who lived below stairs. An all-star cast that includes such notables as James Cagney, William Powell, Henry Fonda, and Jack Lemmon show a different view of wartime drama aboard a naval ship at sea and the way the various personalities interact. The very clever plot was extremely well acted by Walter Matthau, Glenda Jackson, Sam Waterston, and Ned Beatty, to name a few.  It was an excellent story very excellently presented and one that can be watched again and again. Only Walt Disney could have presented a collection of classical music in such a way that one would want to view this again and again.  It is an essential part to a DVD library. Marilyn Monroe stars as a very capable secretary.  Monty Woolley is retirement age but not wanting to be forced into retirement.  Neither of the two gave the audience want they wanted. My personal favorite was the Jeanne Crain, Dana Andews version, but the Pat Boone, Ann Margaret remake is also included in this packet.  For those who enjoy musicals, it is very well done. With Loretta Young as a devoted and loyal wife to David Niven, this should have been a good movie.  Instead, he came off as utterly selfish, and there was no reason to want them to stay together to the end. Judi Dench brought the imperiousness of Queen Victoria, along with her great vulnerability, to this wonderful story of a woman in great mourning and need and of the man who shared that journey and helped her to grieve and to recover. William Powell did a great job of accurately portraying the great Ziegfeld with all of his indefatigable optimism and resourcefulness.  Luise Rainer and Myrna Loy portrayed his first and second wives, and Frank Morgan was his lifelong friend, business rival, and frequent money lender. With Loretta Young as a devoted and loyal wife to David Niven, this should have been a good movie.  Instead, he came off as utterly selfish, and there was no reason to want them to stay together to the end. Maggie Smith is injured when the railroad car she is riding in is involved in an explosion, so she invites the others from the car to recuperate in her villa during the investigation period.  Her complicated life unfolds as she interacts with her guests. The chemistry of Hepburn and Tracy  is alive and well on screen as they must learn how to merge the human brain of Hepburn with the electronic brain invented by Tracy.  It is a delight to watch the rare talents of these two brilliant performers together... one of my personal favorites. The story should have been great with Charles Coburn to put it over.  It had a good moral plot and good ideals, but the writing was lacking to make it unforgettable. It has all of the elements to make a successful comedy ~ a delightful kid sister who writes to soldiers in the name of her older sister, an enamored, handsome young soldier taken in by these letters, and the girls' parents, who try to keep up with it all.  It is excellent! It has all of the elements to make a successful comedy ~ a delightful kid sister who writes to soldiers in the name of her older sister, an enamored, handsome young soldier taken in by these letters, and the girls' parents, who try to keep up with it all.  It is excellent! Never buy a collection like this.  The worst, most boring movies are selected, some of the biggest flops of these big-name actors are scraped together into a package deal.  Seldom is anything in the collection worth watching. A young man comes to live in the country during the war torn days of bombing in London and finds more people living within the walls of the mansion than meets the eye. A fabulous collection about the four musical daughters (the talented Lane sisters and Gale Page) and their father (Claude Rains), a musical professor, who live with his sister/housekeeper, May Robson, and the lives and loves of these vivacious young women.  Three of these four films show the progression of their intertwining lives; the fourth DVD features the same actors in a different story line, equally as enchanting.  This is a wonderful collection of love and family and talent. Merle Streep did a great job, but there were some disappointing aspects of the film.  It seemed that more emphasis was made on Mrs. Thatcher's old-age dementia than was necessary; this should have been a story of her life as a political ruler and the great impact she had on Britain's history. I enjoyed the story, the characters, the mosaic presentation of India, the look inside the lives of seniors whose ""golden years"" turn out to be quite different from their expectations and what they do to live with it. There was an all-star cast of characters, including Humphrey Bogart as a gangster hiding out in a quiet, respectable boarding house.  Worldly-wise Ann Sheridan brought her talents to the story, and the result was quite delightful.  This movie may be watched again and again. I did not care for ""Becoming Jane"" or ""Brideshead Revisited.""  This version of ""Jane Eyre"" was only marginal; it lacked the powerful performance seen by Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles ~ perhaps because the actors' perfomances were too subdued. The Carol Burnett Show was one of the best and most successful comedy shows ever to be seen on television.  In addition to her wonderful writers, she had a group of great comedians who helped to make her show the success that it was.  This type of comedy has never been repeated since and probably never could be again.  It is truly one of a kind. Darby O'Gill features a very young, handsome Sean Connery and some excellent special effects; Happiest Millionaire tells a true story of instustrialist Biddle features Fred MacMurray and Greer Garson; the Gnome-Mobile has great special effects, and the One and Only Genuine, Original Family Band gives a refreshing glimpse at yesteryear with its patriotism and Americana ~ a very worthwhile collection for lovers of Disney feature films. This fim had all of the best elements of wartime romantic dramas ~ the sweet, innocent young girl seeking an acting career in New York meets a soldier home on leave quite by accident and falls for him at once.  Other characters in the story complicate matters, but you find yourself hoping they will end up together. Even with such notable stars as Ann Harding, Leslie Howard, and Myrna Loy, this film was unimpressive... far better was the remake, ""One More Tomorrow,"" with Dennis Morgan and Ann Sheridan, along with Jack Carson and Jane Wyman. Zasu Pitts' unique characteristics made the story enjoyable.  She had a way of expressing herself that made her fun to watch.  There was also an added bonus short that was quite comical.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3MHEGH6EIS5ZU," I think this movie needed some serious editing...the family's Christmas celebration and St. Lucia's candle headdresses would have made a hysterical SNL skit but as a movie...meh, way too drawn out, much too long. I have really enjoyed the entire Empire series. Very well done, actually quite accurate...unlike so many television productions that attempt to give an overview or base the series on various Historic eras. Appreciate the interweaving of re-enactments, film of the actual places and the narration and commentary. Excellent. Ok I admit it...I love Agatha Christie, Jane Austen, all things English...great escape and such incredibly entertaining actors. Wonderful ensemble cast and of course Maggie Smith is marvelous...murder in a country manor. I have really enjoyed the entire Empire series. Very well done, actually quite accurate...unlike so many television productions that attempt to give an overview or base the series on various Historic eras. Appreciate the interweaving of re-enactments, film of the actual places and the narration and commentary. Excellent. If you liked Ab Fab and Clatterford, you will definitely enjoy Sensitive Skin...Lumley takes a look at love, life and romance in her 50-60's. Pathos, comedy, excellent. Just love her comedic range...and have enjoyed watching her for years but this series was particularly good because it revolves around situations and thoughts that are ""age appropriate"" (if you are 60 something). I had gotten the original 1930 or 40 something ""The Women"" with all the old great stars and was ""blown away"" both by how well the comedy held up as well as the changes. FASCINATING and a MUST HAVE for your own personal film retrospective.

FASCINATING and a MUST HAVE for your own personal film retrospective. Filmed by BBC and HBO in 2007-08 an interesting inside picture of the Hussein family dynamic. Is this what it takes someone crazier and more paranoid than the Shiia and Sunni who have been fighting each other since Mohammed died? I was totally swept up in Season 1. Season 2 a little less. Season 3 my interest was waning. Great cast, I can't pinpoint why exactly maybe too big a time lag between seasons but just couldn't get into this show as I did initially. Based on a true story, I really enjoyed this story. Incredible story of escape from Siberia on foot and the 4500 mile trek through desert, the mountains of Tibet to India. Fascinating combination of characters including an American who had gone to Russia after the Revolution and his disillusion and imprisonment in Siberia....really interesting as this story begins before World War II and ends forty plus years later. Although I'd loved the whole Lark Rise to Candleford Series...Season Four was a disappointment. Definitely felt like school a month before graduation. Not a lot of plot development, fewer episodes...however since I owned Seasons 1-3 despite the shortcomings of Season 4 I wanted a complete set of the series. I was a fan of the original BBC Forstye Saga and curious as to the newer version of The Forstye Saga. What an improvement...photographically, of course, but I am a real fan of Homeland's Damian Lewis also. EXCELLENT cast, wonderful story and of course incredible technical improvements have taken place in production. Wonderful sets, costumes, etc. Definitely a must have for fans...hours of enjoyment. Totally charming story, great cast. Quality of Blu-ray version is excellent. Wonderful to have in your film library if you like cozying up to escape into movies that combine a total change of scene from one's everyday life and offers a ""screen visit"" with a host of  endearing characters. Ok for a movie but just doesn't live up to the book. Probably would love it if I hadn't read the book and granted the trilogy is so much of incredible images it would be hard for a movie to measure up...but if you love this movie and haven't read the books...please don't miss the books! ABSOLUTE TRASH...literally HATE SPEAK. I watched 5 minutes and was appalled this is a conspiracy film reminiscent of Nazi propaganda. I was appalled to find it on Amazon under purporting to be able JFK, Jr. Loved the Triology and was worried that the movie interpretations might not live up to the books. So far so good in terms of screen adaptations. Will look forward to next installments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3BOIJO08BTJUD," Mu husband saw all of these on PBS long ago and really wanted to see them again.  He is enjoying them just as much as the first time amd now I get to see what he was talking about.  These will be cherished forever in out household. I bought this movie for a friend who had one too many motorcycle accidents.  He now must just enjoy watching the motorcycle exploits of others and this movie was perfect for him. Bought this for a friend who was and is a motorycle enthusiast.  He loves it .  Some bad lock on the motorcycle race track has him left only being able to relive the sport he loves wih movies like this. I remember when I was about six years-old and my mom took me and my siblings to see Alice in Winderland at the theater.  Every time I see this movie it takes me back to that time.  Each time I see things that I was not old enouth to notice then.  I really makes me feel younger. I got your aceptance of my order.  You got my money.  The due date passed. I got nothing.  Had to contact you.  Didn't even get an apology. Needless to say I AM NOT PLEASED. Fawlty Towers is British comedy at its best.  I enjoy watching it over and over and sharing it with friends who stop by.  Telling about it is good but being able to let them see is so much better. I bought this for my sister-in-law.  I had never seen it before.  I watched it before I gave it to her and loved it.  I laughed right out loud and was so glad I was watching on tape so I could stop it and come back when the inevitable interruptions came. I loved this film. I bought this for a friend who used to race every weekend in the summer.  His doctor advised him not to race any more.  He still enjoys the idea of racing and this movie makes him feel like he is right there. This nice family Christmas tale is great entertainment for EVERVONE!  It was good to see the old stars.  It is often hard to find movies for the younger members of the family that even grandma likes. I enjoyed all of the Jeeves and Wooster which were shown on PBS.  I am not sure they showed them all and I could not watch whenever I wanted.  Now I can experience a Jeeves and Wooster marathon (without pledge breaks) whenever I want. These Midsommer Murders were as delightful nd entertaining as all I have seen in the past.  I look forward eagerly to the next set I will be able to afford.  They offer hours of stimulating entertainment.  We watch them over and over. I loved this sries on PBS and always wanted to own it.  Your price and service were outstanding!  I know I will enjoy these discs for years to come. Thank You! I have enjoyed ""Keeping Up Appearances"" since I first saw it on PBS.  The purchase of this set means I can watch any time I want and in perfect clarity.  I can also introduce friends and family to major British comedy. The British seem to have a way with mysteries that very few Americans have.  My husband and I are very fond of the Nidsomer Mysteries and the sets are (at least in our pinion) the BEST WAY to get then and have them where we can watch them whenever we wish. My husband and I have loved the Midsomer Murders with John Nettles since the first one we ever saw.  We are trying to collect all of the Midsomer murders with John Nettles and this set helped us get closer to that goal.  We very much enjoy having a Midsomer Marathon any time we choose/ My husband and I have loved the Midsommer murders with John Nettles since the first one we ever saw.  We decided to collect all of the Midsommer murder sets with John Nettles.  This set put us one step closer to our goal.  Now we can watch them whenever we wish. My husband and I have loved Midsomer Murders with John Nettles since the first one we ever saw.  We have decided to collect all Midsomer Murders starring John Nettles,  You have helped us get one step closer to our goal.  We just love having our own Midsomer Marathon whenever we want. I have always enjoyed Robert Conrad.  I have purchased not only Baa Baa Black Sheep, but also Wild Wild West.  Every time I watch any of these I am transmitted back to my school days.  If nothing else his films keep me young at heart. I was able to watch a few of these on PBS, but housework and husbands constantly interrupted the shows.  By purchasing the complete series I can watch all episodes in order any time I have a few minutes, and if I am interrupted I just have to ""pause"" until I am ready to resume.  Perfect. I saw a few Hetty Wainthrop Investigates on our local PBS station.  They were always well done.  I always wanted more when they were replaced by some other ""Mystery"" on the PBS channel we got.  Getting the complete set now means I can watch them all whenever I want and as often as I want without having to wait for the local PBS to schedule them and show them. When Banacek was first on TV I was in high school.  Our family had 1 television.  I have 5 younger brothers and sisters and a very domineering father.  I only got to see Banacek when everything aligned.  Needless to say, Not Very Often.  Now I can watch them all without having to get the approval of all occupants of the house.  They are as good as I remembered from the few I got to see. When Banacek was first on TV I was in high school.  Our family had 1 television.

Now I can watch them all without having to get the approval of all occupants of the house.  They are as good as I remembered from the few I got to see. When I was just a little kid my mother took me to see this movie at the theater.  At that time I was not allowed popcorn or a drink.  The movie was much better with the refreahments and I could pause the tape to go to the bathroom and never miss a second.  It was even better than when I was seven. When I saw this title I just had to watch it.  I had to know if it was as good as the first Nanny McPhee.  It was!  Every second was enjoyable!  No disappointments here! This set of Midsomer Murders was as delightful as the others.  It has offered me many hours of crime busting entertainment.  They are so good I watch them over and over.  They never grow old. I was a little hesitant about buying this as I had never seen any of the Blue Murder programs, but I have LOVED all of the other British mysteries I have seen so I tried.  I am very glad I did.  Blue Murder was a lot like the American Cop shows such as Law and Order, but grittier.  I was very glad that I gave it a try. We chose this book because we loove the Midsomer Murders.  We are colliecting then as we cn afford them.  This maked our collection one step closer to completion.  My husband watches them over and over and enjoys then as much on the repeat viewings as the first time. Columbo was even better than when I watched it on TV.  No Commercials.  I would recommend this series to any mystery buff.  They are made to watch again and again.  The Complete Series is the way to go. I fell in love with this program when I was in high school.  My mother would not always let me watch it.  Now I can watch any time I want. stop. pause and enjoy. My husband and I have loved Midsomer Murders since the first time we saw one.  We like to waatch them over and over.  We are making a collection and hope one day to have them all.  My husband has days when only Midsomer Murders will do.  He watches ou collection disc after disc.  He sees more and more each time he watches them. I have loved all episodes of ""Foyles War"".  I very much enjoy Michael Kitchen and am very glad that I have collected the whole set and may watch them over and over any time I want.  Thank You Michael Kitchen and Amazon for making it all possible. I always watched the Father Dowling Mysteries on TV whenever they were on and I had the time.  They were on before I had a VCR and so I was at the mercy of the TV schedule and my personal schedule.  Now I can watch as much as I want whenever I want.  Makes the whole experience more enjoyable. I had seen several of the Foyle's War episodes on PBS and enjoyed them very much.  This set was perfect.  I enjoyed every episode.  This is the way to get these shows. I have enjoyed the Touch of Frost mysteries since I saw my first one on PBS.  It is wonderful to find them all in one place at such a reasonable price.  My husband and I both love watching them and will spend many happy hours watching them over and over  again any time we want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A1DMEO1SDEKW4G," LOVED it!!! I watched this on Masterpiece Theater and was hooked. Had to have it! If you are a fan of the show, this one will not disappoint! The cast, scenery, acting and writing were all superb! No wonder it is nominated for so many Emmys!!! Looking forward to the next installment!!! I watched this with my daughters when they were very little many years ago. I was so happy when I came across it on DVD and now I can share it with my grandson. This is a beautiful and magical story. There is not really any dialog, just lovely music. It is so different from any other seasonal movie. Very enjoyable and so worth having. Such a cute movie for all ages. Finding the 1st Shrek isn't all that easy. My little grandson is really into all things Shrek. One of the few words he can say. This was a great price so I got two copies. One for my house and one for his. This is a beautiful true story about a little prince so many never knew existed. I first saw it on Masterpiece Theater and loved it. It's beautifully done and of course the acting is superb! Like so many other M.P.T. productions, there is a lot of history mixed in with the story without feeling like you are going to have a pop quiz at the end. Love it!! The first movie, A Hazard of Hearts was excellent. Top notch! Great story, great actors and beautiful scenery. I really enjoyed it. It was worth buying on it's own. BUT Lady Hamilton, the second movie on the disk was not any of the above. The acting is horrible and the sound was just as bad. I got this for my little grandson. He really enjoys all of the characters, the music and dancing. He will watch it over and over and over and over and over again. It is such a cute movie for all ages. Great for family movie night no matter how old. My little grandson is totally into Shrek. So this was a must have. I was happy I found the first one and now the last one. Great price. Now I have a complete set for his house and mine. This is classic Masterpiece Theater. Loved it. Actors and scenery are superb as usual. The story takes you through the life of the main character. He isn't perfect, but you really care what happens to him. I did not buy this film, but did watch on PBS Masterpiece Theater. It was a bit slow for me and although the actors did a great job, I sadly admit it wasn't among my favorites. I am a huge Masterpiece Theater fan, but was a bit disappointed in the story. I have so many favorite episodes from my childhood that I never thought I would see again. I am so pleased to be able to share these now with my kids and grandkids. Yes the sound is out of sync here and there but considering the age, I'm glad to see them as good as they are!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1JW3SQIUMORTO," Steven King at his best.  Kathy Bates and David Straithern at theirs.  A great story with enough twists to keep you glued to the story.  This is also a great story about the devotion of mothers to their children and the sacrifices they make for them.  Oh  and Christopher Plummer is fantastic too, but then he is Christopher Plummer and he always is. Great story, well told and well acted.  Why we hadn't heard more about this in history class, I'll never know.  It's a great example of my argument against ""Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.""  It should be ""Civil Rights Day"" to honor ALL the people who fought against prejudice and slavery. Very similar in theme to Rosalind Russell's ""Never Wave at a Wac.""  Private Benjamin, however, updates the humor to more modern times, when studio bosses didn't flip out over every little inference.  Hawn does a great job in the role, but no one is better than Eileen Brennan.  She purrs with delight each time she gets the chance to grab a 'gotcha' moment on Private Benjamin.  Very funny stuff and holds up well. There is no way to not love Bean.  No way, no how.  He is hilarious, inventive, and always watchable.  Atkinson is a genius - in this character and all those he's done.  Never turned in a bad performance that I saw. There is no way to not love Bean.  No way, no how.  He is hilarious, inventive, and always watchable.  Atkinson is a genius - in this character and all those he's done.  Never turned in a bad performance that I saw. I think this movie would have benefitted from less screaming.  My eardrums most certainly would have.  At least someone tried to make a thrilled without a ton of gore for once. Delightful film and interesting to see the evolution of a film classic that almost didn't happen.  Naturally, Hanks and Thompson nail their roles. Thompson's character is complicated and layered.  An added joy is the brief, but charming background vignettes with Colin Farrell and Ruth Wilson that help lay the foundation of the story.  Cinematography is also well done in this picture, as is the costume design, which bounces between timelines. Hidden gem of a film and destined to be a cult classic.  Jennifer Coolidge should be given a star turn after this.  You can't take your eyes off her and, even when she's out of frame, she's still hilarious.  Keri Russell knows how to pick a script! Well acted film.  Naomi Watts always surprises me with her performances and seems to be able to blend into any ""skin.""  Diana's shoes, however, are impossible to fill of course.  The story in this film needed to be told and, hopefully, it's accurate.  Sadly, it is also a reminder of the unpleasant reality that while Diana never got to live her happy ending thanks to a world that was obsessed with her, Camilla is living the high life undeservedly. If M. Night Shyamalan did LSD, this is probably what he'd come up with.  Sadly, we'd still be frustrated with having wasted two hours of our lives.  It's a film trying a little too hard to be artsy and deep when it is really only moderately atmospheric and pointless.  There is no story arc and only vague character development given that there are no plausible reasons presented for most the behavior in the story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A22RE7V8QZFICW," I also have the VHS version. I played it many times. The DVD is just as good (well, actually the DVD quality of both audio and visual is better than the VHS). I love this DVD. If you like classic Madonna, get this! Other than a few improved gore scenes, which lasted only seconds, it's just like the original movie, which I didn't particularly like.  What a waste of time. The original was better acted. The transylvania accents sound really phoney; so much so it was almost laughable.  The whole story and variations of the theme of the dracula fiction was also absurb. The main theme is some stupid amulet. I just didn't like the movie. The story is too far absurb, and I didn't like the fusion between the old world and the new-all through the amulet ""breaking the wall of time"" It was like mixing two separate themes which totally clashed. Well, it had a lot of people thrown around, sudden loud sounds (is that supposed to scare me?), with what I thought was very demented acting (even the screaming was silly) and even the costumes looked like..costumes made of plastic. I was so bored silly I had a VERY hard time staying awake and I yawned about 50 times. Seriously. I did. Big time disappointing. NOT scary. I thought 100% silly. I can't believe the ""good reviews"".  The acting was bad. I'm normally a fan of Adrienne Barbeau.  But I wasn't impressed with it. IT BORED ME SILLY and I had to really fight to stay awake. Life of Pi: I thought was a ridiculous movie whose only saving grace was an incredible amount of computerized special effects. Many parts of the movie I thought idiotic.  The ending of the movie disappoints, leaving a fantasy world movie into a tale of lies and deceit. I'm glad I watched it at my friends' house and didn't buy it. Overrated for sure. If I purchased this for $15 I'd be crying for having wasted my money! For horror fans, this is a MUST see.  I liked it better than the first Human Centipede. I have a pretty strong stomach when it comes to horror movies, but this was a special treat because I almost vomited, and at another point I felt dizzy which means it was a GREAT MOVIE.  You get what you pay for.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a total assault on your senses - it entertains enormously. It's disappointing that an elite few can still live in such opulence when there is so much poverty and destruction in the world.  While I'm a big fan of Downton Abby for the work is fiction, I really don't care to see animals killed and butchered to feed these wealthy heathens. I remember being a HUGE FAN of this show and it was so delightful it finally came out on DVD - the ENTIRE SEASON.  What amazes me is how incredibly crystal clear and perfect the DVDs are.  Thank you, SHOUT, for making this DVD collection happen. Very little Krampus, mostly about cops with a cast of very bad actors and bad script. You have to bend over backward to act this bad.  This is one of the biggest ripoffs I have ever seen.--it's truly bad, boring, and STUPID to the max.  You won't see much Krampus--just stupid cops.  It makes you wish Krampus would just kill everybody to make the bad acting end.  Do not buy this movie.  You will be sorely disappointed. This is a porno-flick and not a movie.  Plenty of bare-chested women, bare bottoms and even hair on naughty bits...is supposed to compensate for horrifically BAD acting, BAD script, CORN OFF THE COB movie. A PURE LOSER and if you even spend a dollar on this you got ripped off.

APZ9MBMUKD2W," If one wants to see how the upper class use to live in Edwardian England and how it ended with the waste of World War I. Than this is the place to go to. The BBC has outdone itself with this one. A great soap opera story about the US Navy in the Pacific Theatre of Operations during WWII, with a rich mixture of back stabbing, so so love affairs, a rape and some really great special effects for its time. I just hope Rodney finally gets the respect owed him! I frankly think that this is his best work! If you want to see a good screw ball comedy about University, then here you go! Who else but Peter Sellers could make Thermal Nuclear War funny?  That and watching Slim Pickins sailing down to a Russian Nuclear Missle site on a A Bomb with his Cowboy hat on makes this a classic moment in Comedic History. If you want to see how a real hard nose leader can turn around a ""Hard Luck"" outfit, then this is the film for you. I am always surprised how complex and realistic a film was made so soon after the last great shooting match in Europe. A great film and cast. If you want a good light hearted comedy to watch tonite with a great cast and a great script then I think that you will fall in love with this movie. I most certainly did. I just love this film! Old Blue Eyes did real justice to one of the strangest and most effective Politicans to come out of the Old South.(Earl Long)I am willing to bet Bill Clinton has this film in his library. A classic and flawless example of how America was and still is the king of the Musical. The cherography, photography, casting , sets, costume just push this film toward legendary status. Mel Brooks really earned his pay that day. If you want a good campy and funny film when you have some down time then here you go! I just love Gene Hackman in one of his few comedic roles as the blindman. I really loved this film as it is not your traditional war film. The premise of having a bunch of renegade GI's rob a bank is a clever one. I am sure that it happened in one of our wars. If you want a good but ""light"" version of W.S.C. life then this is a good place to start. I just wish that someone would do say like Manchestors books on him into a film. It is one hell of a good story that needs telling more now than ever. I frankly feel that Churchill will be rated the Man of the 20th Century and a sort of Cassandra to boot. He had that much vision into the future. Its a pity as this could of been a great war film but it just did not have the right stuff. Heston & Niven were good as was Ms. Gardner but the spirit was strong but it could not over come its problems. This is a great campy satire of the James Bond Movies which was the major film fad at the time. I enjoyed it greatly even if it had Woody Allen in it. A kind of swan song for a great group of the old school actors.  If you want a light version of A.C.'s book ""Death on the Nile"" and see some great old pros at work then here you go! One of the Best political films around, Ian Richardson is at the top of his game. If you like something that is very intelligent, cynical and entirely believeable about the ruling class of Great Britain well then go no further. Well done to all hands involved! A classic example of the great work that the Brits do for historical films. Glenda Jackson MP was a great choice for the role of Elizabeth. Well worth the coin and time! I seriously think that this is Spenser Tracy's best work! It takes a good hard look at the Nurenburg Trials and the cost of Hitler's Reign of Terror. I found it very thought provoking and worthy of seeing again. A little off the beaten track but a great introduction to that British Institution Lloyds of London and the birth of the Insurance Industry. Yeah I know it sounds boring but give it a chance! Tryone Powers is in it! This film is just another example why that small island off the coast of Europe is one of the top producers of some great understated humor! Top marks around for all hands! In a way this film is a lot like the Gary Cooper Classic ""High Noon"" it being set in the future and at a space mining station. It is well written and the cast do a grand job. (Especially the Doctor) If you like Westerns and or SF, then I can safely recommend it. John Huston really earned his pay on this one! I think Kipling would of approved of it. What Stud has not dreamed of going out and carving his own Kingdom with the sweat of his brow, cunning and blood. If not don't look at this film but for the rest of us fix bayonet and charge. It seemed that the last few films of Clint were slipping overall. But this one is not one of them. I really enjoyed this one as it was well thought out and well performed. Bravo to all hands involved! If you want to get a taste of how bad things use to be back in the bad old days of the South this would be a good place to start. This film is just another example why that small island off the coast of Europe is one of the top producers of some great understated humor! Top marks around for all hands! If you want to hear some good tunes and see a good movie then here you go. This film also showes how the Music Business will take you, chew you up and spit you out if you let it. I think that this is the best film about Good Queen Bess since Elizabeth R. The writing and acting was 1st rate and some one paid attention to historical fact to boot. I thought the character of Walshingham was an added plus to the film. Well done to all hands! If you want a good escapism movie about the upper class & their hi jinks that is well written and a great cast, then here you go. With apologies to Mr. McQueen, this is just a fun film to watch. Bravo to all hands involved. I bought this on a whim and am I grateful. I had forgotten the charm, innocence and wisdom of Uncle Martin. Comparing it to some of the stuff of peddled today. It just makes one aware of how rude and courser most of our entertainment has become. I hate saying this but I learned more about life from this film than I did while attending High School at the same time. Maybe because I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer but every time I see this film I find something new in it. A first rate film and I just wish that Hollywood could make more films of this high a quality. Except for a couple of minor errors (You don't walk across a field and talk loudly! Everyone takes off their badges of rank and stripes)This is pretty close to what some of my older relatives & friends have told me about the BIG ONE! A fitting tribute to the Guys who walked the walk and talked the talk. An excellent solid addition to ones sand and sandals collection of films. I thought that while the premise was a little far fetched the writing, acting and photography over came this problem! I think Ben Hur would of liked this film. Yes I know that its really a great big and grand soap opera. With Mr. Heston being the constant witness to the trial and tributions of the early years of the Roman Empire and the Birth of Christainity. But what a show to behold, the chariot race is worth the price of the film by itself! They just don't make them like this anymore! A classic example of the great work that the Brits do for historical films. Glenda Jackson MP was a great choice for the role of Elizabeth. Well worth the coin and time! Mr. Schama does a great job on a very broad subject. In that He takes a very hard and realistic look upon his nations history that makes for a good story. His choice of locations, facts and music are outstanding! He is a great storyteller. This Film is well worth the time money. This film just goes to show that sometimes your family can be your worst enemy. Ms. Carter was an excellent ""Queen"" Jane and the actress who played ""Bloody"" Mary was outstanding! I am so glad that I was not around in Tudor England! Another example of a European ""Art"" film that shows a half way decent looking teen age girl in the buff and her sex life. With some older woman exploring her ""repressed issues"" thrown in for good measure. I was not impressed by this film except for the photography of the beautiful French Country side. This is one of the best Movies that I ahve seen this year. The writing, photography, actors, sound and all the rest again show what Hollywood could do if it wanted to.  It showed Ray warts and all which makes it a stronger film. Face it the Mans early life was a mess but he got his act together and we are so much richer as a Nation because of it. Well done to all hands! The best answer to James Bond and the idea that the world of spying is a fast & fun fill one. Instead this film shows it to be the grim, gritty, somewhat boring one of the real world.  Altogether a brillant piece of film making, Mr. Guiness was just brillant as Smiley as was the rest of a very talented cast.  A job very well done! Ted Bundy may of been likable, but he was still scum of the earth. I beg to differ in that this film showed him to be the ruthless thug that he was. I especially like the ending , where instead of the pity most films try project onto the condemmed. This film instead shows Ted to be the cowardly wimp that he was. Good Riddance is all I can say. A good solid film. I am so glad that some one got these mens story before the silent artillery of time silenced them. This is a great look at the Men who helped pulled the plug on some of the greatest evil to face our nation. I really like this film when you have some time on your hands. I frankly think its the last of the really big movies put out by the studios before they went under. The scale and expense of this film is just mind boggling! That and I think Rex Harrison really got into the spirit of what Julius Caesar must of been like. It is also obvious that the fire between Mr. Burton and Ms Taylor was real. As always the 1st season is usally the best and the rule applys here with a vengence. So if you want to walk down memory lane and have a couple of good belly laughs then think about getting this DVD. I was living in LA during this time and its hard to forget the fear that hit the city. This film helps recreate the fear caused by these barbarians. If anything ended the 60's it was this senseless killing. I recommended this film highly. If you really want to know the down and dirty about Homers tale, then you hit the jackpot. Mr. Wood in an obvious labor of love, goes forth in finding out if there really was a War on that windy hill in Western Asia Minor. The trail is a long and windy one from the Gold Fields of California, to Berlin and Greece. With a cast of characters that rivial a Chinese Opera. Altogether its well worth the money. I really doubt that the real Arthur will ever be found. But this film takes a good shot at it. I thought Excalibur was a better film than this one. But don't let me stop you from seeing King Arthur. It has some good moments like the battle at the frozen lake. It also gives one a good hint at what the beginning of the Dark Ages of Britain might of looked like.  A solid B+ film. My wife the RN of the family showed me this film and I am glad that she did. While the story of medical research might seem boring, this film over comes it with some good acting and script writing! Well worth the time to watch it! This is one of the best Movies that I ahve seen this year. The writing, photography, actors, sound and all the rest again show what Hollywood could do if it wanted to.  It showed Ray warts and all which makes it a stronger film. Face it the Mans early life was a mess but he got his act together and we are so much richer as a Nation because of it. Well done to all hands! I thought for the times that it was made in that this is one of the better Crime Movies. It was a real ground breaker in dealing with sexual deviantancy and the Monster that was the Boston Strangler. A good solid effort that looks back to the dawn of our current sad state of society. I am so glad that some one got these mens story before the silent artillery of time silenced them. This is a great look at the Men who helped pulled the plug on some of the greatest evil to face our nation. If this is your cup of tea i.e. ""The Natives are up and the Regiment marches at Dawn"". I think that you will be very happy with this film. I just wish that it would come out in DVD! I have always thought Ms Welsh was an underrated, underused actress and this small gem of a film with Bill Cosby is the main piece of evidence of my thesis. While its a true product of the 70's, its humor and charm still seems ring thru. I just wish they would make it into a DVD. She should also be seen in The 3 Musketeers. I do not know how to describe this show is it a comedy or an adventure or a drama? None the less I can highly recommend this series for those who like some really good light entertainment with an off beat but brillant cast!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3SD53AFOVP8DD," I like the color film documentaries and this one is very satisfying.  The footage is pretty good and includes many scenes I have never seen before.  If you're a fan of the color film documentaries of WWII, this one should be in your collection. I love Fawlty Towers and have been a dedicated fan for decades, but this DVD, with each episode re-mastered is simply a must-have for any Fawlty Towers fan.  The re-mastering makes the episodes look great and of course, this is some of the best comedy to ever emerge from England.  A fantastic DVD that would be a great addition to any fan's collection! This is yet another series titled ""WWII in color"" but of the many labeled that way, this is the least interesting.  The feel you get with this DVD is that someone saw all the series titled that way and threw something together to get on the band wagon.  Kind of dissappointing, not cohsive at all, and a lot of rehashed video. I am a real Dilbert fan and the animated series is a load of laughs - this DVD brings you more than you will ever need of our favorite nerd and his adventures through a crazy business world, that often seems too close to reality!  I strongly recommend this DVD. Although the original Tremors movie was funny and a great production, the sequels that followed took the series to a place it didn't have to go - that is, they are pretty stupid when the worms morph into other strange creatures - still, this is the entire collection in one package and in that, its worth having in your collection if you liked the original. Fairly lame movie that is made only worse by the acting.  Of course anything with Shannen Doherty in it is Dead on Arrival and in this, she is her usual untalented ""how did this person ever get any role"" mode. This series provides a fantastic view of ""what happened after"" WWII and how many strived to bring the Nazi's to justice.  What I liked about this is that it does not focus only on Adolf Eichmann which so many similar series to - his story is there - but there is much more detail as to how the Jews and many others worked hard to catch the animals that were the Nazi's. As dissappointing as Jackson's interpretation of the Hobbit is (not even close to the book), this DVD is the best you can own if you want to add this to  your JRR Tolkein collection. This performance by Take That includes Robbie Williams on many of the performances, but there is also plenty of Gary, Howard, Mark and Jason too.  Great show captured in Manchester, with an incredible stage production.  Well worth the money! Although this is no screen burner, its a pretty good and believable story.  Depp is okay in his role, but the supporting actors are very good.  This one is worth seeing, especially if you don't have to pay for it. The seller of this series provided a great price, delivery and service - but the collection itself is a bit lacking.  Its not bad, just not overwhelmingly good.  There are a number of series titled ""WWII in Color"" and this is NOT the Television series which was so good.  This series is great but a bit disjuncted - its more like they built the series around the footage they had instead of a cohesive front to back story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2," IF I'M WRONG I'LL APOLOGIZE, AFTER LEARNING HOW TO OBTAIN CLOSED CAPTIONED. My TV set has never failed to display CC or English Titles, but on this DVD it doesn't. There is no ""language"" set-up option. This is not the typical Audrey Hepburn movie.   I heard that Ms. Hepburn took ballet lessons but was too tall to get taken seriously. In ""Funny Face"" she dances with Fred Astaire and one can see the ballet moves.   I'd much rather see Fred Astaire dance with Rita Hayworth, but gave it a four star for the dancing. Set in France just prior to the French Revolution, Glenn Close, Michelle Pfeiffer,and Uma Thurman do the very best to allure the French Nobility to their doom. The settings and costumes are magnificent. The screen writing is witty and lively. This DVD is definitely worth the discounted price, of excellent quality, and belongs in every collection. This World War II film focuses on the success of a counter intelligence scheme. Clifton Webb plays a senior British officer and Gloria Grahame the innocent woman that unconsciously causes the scheme to work.   Well worth seeing. This is a story about a New York City police detective (Gene Hackman) and his partner (Roy Scheider) and their relentless pursuit to discover a drug source. The high speed chase scenes take them far outside the city limits and get deadly when an attempt is made to kill Gene Hackman's character (""Popeye"" Doyle).  This is good police drama and quite entertaining. The five stars I gave this movie is all Rita Hayworth's.   The acting, settings and plot is typically older, but when Fred Astaire starts twirling Rita Hayworth, she goes everywhere but around his fingers.   A great musical. Roger Moore sports two Bond Girls; Maud Adams and Kristina Wayborn, in this non-stop, action packed race that only James Bond can manage.  ""Octopussy"" marks the changing James Bond character, from Sean Connery's sober and imperfect 007 to Daniel Craig's 'man of steel' imagery. Roger Moore is suave, romantic, yet manages to walk the line between violence and necessity.  Good old fashion Bond entertainment. John Cleese leads the way with humor and it's all fun.   Set in an English hotel run by Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) and his wife where nothing goes right but always ends well.   The twelve episodes still work today, and was translated into just about every language and rerun many times on the BBC.   This communicates a universal popularity.   You'll love it. ""Fatal Instinct"" focuses on spoofing ""Body Heat"", Double Indemnity"", and Basic Instinct."" The humor moves well under the direction of Carl Reiner. Sean Young plays the central female role. The features included in the making of... are very entertaining. This is the fourth in the Bond series and the place where action-hero begins getting really outrageous.   The fact that the NATO Air Force lost two nuclear bombs gets put aside while the actors pack the action to the hilt. The scope is grand and one wonders where the writers will go from here. Yet, sixteen additional Bond movies follow.   The DVD is excellent quality. Although a must for Goldie fans, this 1973 film does little to arouse the senses. Even this well-planned bank robbery is much too light-headed to offset the serious acting talent of Gert Frobe (of Goldfinger fame).  More power to Goldie for the leg up this flick provided. Otherwise, there is little else to say, except that if not a Goldie fan, the film can be avoided. One of the last of the older World War II movies that depicts the tension between men at war and a cowardly company commander. If one remembers Jack Palance, he's the protagonist. Lee Marvin goes on to become a very successful actor I really don't think the movie is worth fifteen bucks. The Big Easy is a romantic and humorous melodrama.  The players (a family of cops) are involved in mostly petty police corruption, the district attorney (Helen Barkin) investigates as fresh murders are being credited to rival gang turf battles. As the murders get closer and closer, the suspense leads to an action packed climax and some surprises.  This film is set in New Orleans in the Cajun tradition and definitely worth the price. In the Raymond Chandler tradition, Jack Nicholson portrays an excellent spin-off character of that era.  While investigating misaligned marriages, the private eye stumbles onto murder and mass corruption at the Los Angeles' water and power company. John Huston plays the top dog; as family head and the influence under the silent partnerships that motivate murder. Faye Dunaway provides the romantic lure angle.  Good entertainment value for this genre. From a confused ambiance of dreams and realities, Grace (played by Nicole Kidman) develops a tension-filled atmosphere of suspense, as unfolding events remain confined to psychologically frightening spaces; within this macabre and diabolical tale of horror.  ""The Others"" is the greatest ghost-story ever told and stands as the best in its class. Ghost-story lovers, believe me, you have not seen a ghost story quite like this.  ""The Others"" is a must-see. Set in Panama just after the fall of Noriega, the plotting finds the country in disarray. Noriega is gone but the drug trades and corruption still exist. So, instead of sending in James Bond, MI6 sends in a second chance agent (played by Pierce Bronson).   It is obvious to the viewer that Pierce Bronson had a lot of fun making the movie and you will too watching it. A swashbuckling storyline with all the trimmings of a romantic, high seas adventure.  The story includes rivalry between the powers that be, regarding the same girl (Keira Knightley). Johnny Depp plays the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow and adds greatly to the mystery and spirit of high seas drama. The movie was good, with an interesting plot about a painting that held secrets. As people get murdered, the suspense builds.  In the lead role, Kate Beckinsale is definitely worth seeing; outstanding without the usual support.  OVERALL, THE MOVIE WAS VERY ENTERTAINING, AN ENJOYABLE MYSTERY, AND I RECOMMEND IT. This 1938 black and white shows just how humorous Edward G. Robinson can be. Four years afterward he made Larceny,Inc., another great comedy. The story centers around gangsters that go straight but can't quite make the transition. I recommend this DVD. The writing contained too much misdirection that frustrated the expectation of things to come. It overall moved very slowly like a soap and that doesn't mean others aren't going to like it, just that I did not. The plot is thin and lacks intrigue. There are four episodes on two discs and plenty of viewing time. Jericho is introduced as a television/cop public hero, and that kind of explains his deficiency as a detective. He plays hunches that make no sense and his fellow cops think he is a genius.  The stories almost lack romance and suspense.  But overall, Jericho is entertaining.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AQBN8L3UN50TO," Even though this was filmed quite a while ago, it picked up on issues that are still issues today.  Concern for the environment, teenage angst combined with feelings of alienation.  I think this film is just as entertaining as when it first came out - the casting was great and the performances most excellent.  A great watch for any horror fan. Yeah, they died.  They all died.  The old salt had warned them the berries were poison and to never eat them.  The toddler ate them first - then mom and dad decided to eat some to - so they could all go together.  Now a sequel where the toddler who ate the poisonous berries DIDN'T die.  Boo! This wasn't the best action/adventure flick, not by a long shot.  It did have a pretty good story line and some good action and fighting.  It lost me toward the end with the toy-helicopter flying around shooting real rounds and killing by-standers but always missing the real targets. This film would have got 4-stars from me but for that cheesy ending. I thought the cast was pretty much perfect and their performances were great.  I just didn't think the story was very orginal and it was too easy to guess what was going to happen next.  Still, I enjoyed it and would recommend it, although it was really nothing special or exciting. I haven't read this Wilkie Collins story, but I found it intriguing and for the most part enjoyed it.  The one problem I had was with Christian Slater.  I am a big fan of Slater but this was a terrible miscast.  Instead of a turn-of-the-century English man, he was obviously a modern American.  Just didn't work - that surprised me.  I think anyone who enjoys period-piece dramas will enjoy this film, though. Horrocks is a wonder!  Why isn't she famous here in America?  I hope her amazing talent is appreciated in the UK.  In many ways this movie reminded me of old-fashioned musical romances - but with many modern twists keeping it from being predictable. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. This is a wonderful story.  THe production, casting, everything about this is absolutely perfect.  There is nothing that could have been done to make this better.  A good family film, teaching an important value, I highly recommend this film. This is probably the best pirate movie I have ever seen.  It is hard to tell if it is gered toward kids but adults can like it too, or vice-versa.  Mr. Depp makes the quintessential anti-heroe.  They need to make a sequel all about Jack Sparrow, forget the subplots!! I watched this expecting to see the same old scares with the same old serial killer.  I was startled.  This is not your typical slasher flick.  It is low-budget, but it comes across as something much more. I thought this family movie was really good.  It is basically about an older woman of faith reaching out to a teenager in trouble.  Her gentle compassion touches and changes him.  I thought all the actors and actresses were perfectly cast - they all did a wonderful job.  Aside from a few cuss words (which she gently discourages), this is a great movie for families and children. I would recommend it to anyone. This action-packed thrill-a-minute spy story is based on the excellent book by Robert Ludlum (he's still the best).  This adaptation is excellent.  It starts out fast and keeps the pace right up to the end, which is very satisfying.  I can't wait to see the sequel The Bourne Supremacy.  I know Damon is back, I hope the woman is back too.  They had excellent chemistry.  Over-all, one of the best spy-movies I have ever seen. I've enjoyed this film every time I have seen it.  Taking a completely different look at a end-of-the-world scenario, this movie makes it look fun (without addressing grim facts like what happens when the food runs out, these youngster have no medical knowledge or experience, etc).  I guess these concerns will resolve themselves since they are all so cute and have a sense of humor. This was a very different kind of western. It starts out with immediate violence but without an explanation.  It actually takes a long time for you to begin to understand why one man is relentlessly tracking another.  There is no clear good guy/bad guy - but if you hang in there, it becomes very rewarding.  Over all, I enjoyed this film. Really boring film.  It is nothing but Hollywood insider humor (and most of that is nothing but petty bitchery) and cameos.  If you like to see ""stars"" sitting around talking (blah, blah, blah) and think that is funny, by all means - this is the film for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AT3NIL6Q0G44I," It as a nice movie to watch as it showed how it could have been like if there had been a nuclear war.  It would be nice if they would do a remake of it.  The bad bad part about it was that it was a low budget movie. It was nice for an old science fiction movie was it kept you guessing what would happen next.  I would to see how they would do a remake of it now. I gave this movie as it as great as those made in Japan.  It is nice to see Americans starting in this type of movie.  I just love the action scenes.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves old science fictions movies. It is a good movie to watch if you like fantasy movies.  I like it was it was funny and great to watch.  It makes a great movie for kids to watch. This series was great to watch.  I like anime that keeps my attention, and there was plenty of action. I ready did not like the song at the start.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves Japanese anime. It was a great series to love as I could not stop watching it.  The bad thing is that it was on for one season.  I wish that it could have run for far longer as it was fun to watch. It is a great series for those who like science fiction as it keeps you wondering what was going to happen.  It helps you understand what happen during the early years of Star Fleet and helps you understand some of the things that happen in the original Star Trek. It is a great movie to watch as it is full of action and it keeps you on the edge of your seat as your wonder what is going to happen next. The series keeps getting interesting as it grows.  You never know what will happen after each scene  It is also keeps your attention as you watch now the characters interact with each other. It was a  great movie that kept you glued to you seat.  It could have had more special effects.  They could have had some better kid actors in the supporting roles.  Over all this was a great movie to watch. The Blue Gender: the Complete Series did meet all of my expectations, but not the movie as it was bits and pieces of the series.  They would have done a better job if they had just pasted the parts of the series together to form the movie.  I do not see the reason they made the movie as the series as much better. I gave it this rating as it had some great action screens and it kept you interested in the movie.  It has you waiting for the next movie to come out to see what happens. i gave this rating as it was a wonderful movie.  I think that it was better than the ""Lord of the Rings.  What I liked about it that it did not have so many hobbits running around in it.  I would recommand it to everyone. Prometheus was too munch like Alien to really enjoy.  Too many of the screens copied those of Alien to be ready enjoyed.  I think that hey would have come up with something better. I gave it this rating as it is full of action and you are kept ot the edge of your seat as you ever know what is going to happen next. It was an alright movie to watch if there is nothing else on.  It plays a little out a little slow but you can follow the main idea of the movie.  It was a good ""B"" movie if you do not main reading a lot of sub titles. It was a great movie to watch as it lived up to the other movies in the series.  The only thing I did not like that some of the major characters were killed during the battle. I just love the Resident Evil series, and this has to be one of the best of the series.  I would recommend it to those who like these types of movies. I really enjoyed the movie but I do not think that is was not as great as the book.  It has he hoping that they will make another movie from the EWnder series of books. It was a great movie as I did enjoyed it very much.  It was not was not what I expected as I thought that it was about a land battle, but it was a sea battle.  That was alright as it had a lot of action in it.  I was somewhat surprise with the design of the ships as they had flat decks. It was an alright film collection as it had some very good movies in it.  There some that where not so great.  There where only two that was where a waste of time. It was a great movie to watch as it had a lot of action and it kept you wondering what was going to happen next.  I did not care for the ending, and you should not let young children watch it because of some of the language that was use. It was a great movie to watch as it lived up to the other movies in the series.  The only thing I did not like that some of the major characters were killed during the battle. This series is great to watch as it has a lot of action that keeps your attention.  The only thing wrong with it is the theme song as you get tried of it as you wait to each episode to start. It was all right movie but they could spent a little bit more money on the makeup.  A lot of the zombies look like they were wearing masks and were bald.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1KJC1J89UCTRA," Good special effects for this period, decent action, and more than adequate acting (with the exception of Ulysses' wife).  I do question whether Kirk Douglas was old enough to grow a beard when this was filmed, but who cares.  A decent rendition of a classic tale. This sort of makes it as a historical drama, and sort of makes it as an action flick.  The acting is OK, but worthy of note.  Decent entertainment, no real faults, no real strong points. Decent story line, better than average acting and filming.  Special effects good for that point in time.  All add up to a better than average historical drama with a good bit of action thrown in. If you want some entertainment with no real meaning of anything of special note, here it is.  The acting is OK, the story is OK, the battles are OK, the filming is OK. The film follows history closely--- Genghis was born, he died, he was a Mongol.  Woody Strode looks more Mongol than any of the rest of the cast.  Oh well, the scenery is good, the battles rather well done, the acting-----------well, we won't talk about that. Captures a place and time long ago and far away.  The filming is excellent, the acting good, and the story solid.  What's not to like.  The complaint is that it is difficult to follow the historical significance of the Scots (high landers as opposed to low landers as opposed to English).  Maybe I need to read the book again. It is clear from these films why Flynn was a super star.  He doesn't show any exceptional acting, but he does turn in solid performances in a variety of roles.  He has an undeniable 'presence'.  The series also shows progression of war films as the War progressed.  Those too young to remember the War could benefit from giving some thought to this as they view these; in sequence, please. I guess these films were considered pretty racy when released.  Not so now.  Neither film has much plot, they rely on photography, and a lot of shots of near-naked attractive young human bodies.  Nothing wrong with that. As long as you don't try to bestow any subtle meaning to any of this, you can enjoy the films for what they are. I far preferred the earlier version, although Ronald Coleman was not a convincing swordsman.  Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was a perfect Rudy, and really made this version.  In the second version Stewart Granger was more convincing than Coleman, but but James Mason was simply dreadful as Rudy.  The first version's supporting cast were far more engaging than the same cast in the second. El Dorado, and Katie Elder are OK John Wayne flics.  If they'd been replaced by ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" you'd have the 3 all-time best John Wayne westerns, and the reason the man deserved a couple Oscars, at the least.  Searchers and Shootist are not just great westerns, they are great movies.  They belong in everyone's film library. Flynn at his swashbuckling best.  If you want classic Errol Flynn, this will not disappoint.  It is obvious why Flynn was a popular star.  Try to imagine a present day star who could do this sort of action.  And how many would be willing to perform in tights.  These are classical action films.  Enjoy. If you liked the first season, you'll like the second.  Lots of gore and sex, and nasty Roman's.  I found the gallons of blood a bit tedious.  Sloshing around more than the human body contains when only a minor wound is inflicted seems rather unnecessary. Painted Desert and High Sierra are above average flics of that era.  The other two are OK entertainment, but totally unnoteworthy.  Desert and Sierra are desirable additions to a Bogart collection, displaying the range of his talent.  The stories are quite good, but the screenplay rather uninspired.  The car chase in Sierra was quite good, and thankfully did not have any of the now required flaming crashes.  As usual for this era, nobody knew how to handle a firearm. This DVD gives some useful information about the experience of serving in a bomber flying night missions over Germany in WWII.  It is, however mostly just fluff.  It could have explained where the different crew members were stationed, and explained their duties.  It did show some of the tail gunners problems, but that was about it. Why this movie was highly touted is beyond me.  If you want to see sex, see Spartacus.  If you want a story about admirable people, see American Sniper.  OK, the acting is OK.  The plot is OK, so I can give it a couple stars.  Who wants to buy my copy?  I won't watch it again. The 'plot' is disjointed and makes little sense.  The acting is poor.  Laura Geyser doesn't even try to act.  Then the mish-mash of sub-mediocrity takes a time out for pure XXX porn.  That isn't very well done either. An OK movie with decent plot and acting.  Brosnan is a good villan.  Jovovich seems to have trouble being a normal person instead of Alice.  Sometimes she's awesome, sometimes almost inept.  The director was not really on the ball or she would probably have been consistent  in fighting abilities. While not the best of the Jesse Stone series, it still rates 5 stars.  Select and his supporting actors are, as always absolutely excellent..  The plot and characters are pretty much up to par.  It is a great pity that further episodes can't be cranked out on a weekly basis. Rather well acted and filmed, but the sound was lousy.  It did not have subtitles, and it needed them.  Without understandable dialog the main sea battle was nearly impossible to follow. My copy had problems and one of the action scenes was not viewable.  By and large this is a mediocre rah, rah wartime film with low budget and no big names.  It does, however feature our armored force, and the difficulties faced battling the Germans. This 4 pack is worth a couple viewings.  John Malkovitch, and the gal who was the looney nun in Agnes turn in good performances. Mila Jovovitch does well for that stage in her career.  Various bit actors do quite a nice job.  The only really obnoxious aspects were Jane Fonda prancing around in designer rags smoking cigarettes instead of acting, and the whole pretense that ;Pact of Silence' was an art film by virtue of a lot a staring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A101L4HF0IZ33C," Peter Sellers outdoes himself in this masterpiece of Kubricks. Takes an incredibly serious subject and by satire makes a take a hard look at how close we came.  My only suggestion as a companion piece purchase ""Fail-Safe"". This is a very, very good film. If you enjoy this and have no aversion to subtitles, do a director credit search. I recommend ""Z""; ""State of Siege"" and lastly ""The Confession."" This was more a purchase for my wife then I. She and I both followed the news story as it was happening. It leaves unanswered questions to this day. Jeromy Irons is as always superb. ...be prepared for the poor quality of transfer of vhs to dvd. If you remember actually seeing this on television when it was originally broadcast. Enjoy your memories and buy one of the excellent books on the subject. An excellent adaptation of Orwells classic. Overall gray with is perfect for this film. There is a 1956 version good but not as powerful. Keep in mind this was Burtons last film. Ok I'm the first to admit, not every film is a gem. If you want the best, take the time and read the book, it's worth it. But I grew up with this series so it works for me. Story drives the first two films not CG effects like the newer versions. I expected more, perhaps in depth facts from the history channel. So this was disappointing for me. For someone in Jr. high with a report due, this maybe more interesting then a dry text. I watched this on broadcast before I made the purchase, so I knew what to expect. This episode is interesting, keeps the viewers interest and shows the betrayal of Lincoln's legacy. American Experience remains one of the best programs on television. This episode adds to their reputation. If you need or want a primer on Hamilton, without picking up Ron C.'s book, this is the thing for you ! I was late coming to this show, Began watching it on cable and then binged. Had to have the entire set. Sort of a gritty ""Hill St. Blues"" for those that remember and appreciate ensemble casts. Since I didn't get the chance to see this is the theaters I bought this when it came out. My god this is a terrible film. two hours of my life I'm never getting back.  If you already have the original, don't waste your money on this atrocious dvd. I originally was purchasing the blu-ray of ""Sweeny Todd"" when I saw this two pack for the less then the price of just ""Todd"". Even if you're not a fan of ""Sleepy Hollow"" save your money, buy this and give the other as a gift to someone who is. I love this series, so it became a must to purchase as soon as it was released. I only wish the manufacturer would lower their price and keep the digital (cloud) copy in another edition for those that appreciate and want that feature. If you like 007, you have to have this set. Bought this as a gift to myself, and now every-time my 6 year old grandson is over, the first thing out of his mouth is ""Grampie can we watch Bond?""  Sure the effects in the early Bond films can be almost laughable by todays cgi effects but damn they still are great films! This series started with so much potential and then, through various writers, directors etc, each successive year became a bit more like a comic strip. But I'm a collector so once I'm invested in a series I like to see it through. The best thing, besides the lack of commercials, is the lack of censorship when it comes to the language. Not or watching with the kids but heck this is not supposed to be a pg series, So sit back, get involved and enjoy it. What can I say, well restored, great music, classic film and of course the Fab Four. I have the earlier silver edition but knowing the quality of Criterion this was a must have addition for my Beatle collection. Hoping they can get their hands on the rights for ""Let it be"" since all the versions I've seen are of inferior quality. This series started with so much potential and then, through various writers, directors etc, each successive year became a bit more like a comic strip. But I'm a collector so once I'm invested in a series I like to see it through. I'm a huge Kinks/Ray Davies fan and had ""Return to Waterloo"" on vhs with no vhs player. Copy was good, but as I said quite dated. still acceptable for rabid fans like myself. The book that this film was based on was better. However, if any viewers, don't know this is about the children of The Rosenbergs, the film might be of interest to how the children might have been affected. I have four versions of JC. I so wanted to see this while it was touring, however the producers found the production costs v ticket revenues unsustainable. It would have been an experience.  Of all of the versions I have this however is my lease favorite. The actor playing Judas is the weakest I've ever seen , and since he's the main player it distracts from the performance. The other actors are adequate, with no stand out performances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2JVSNULPMEVOA," I love Whitney Houston and to make the cast a multi-national group was ingenious.  Brandy's eye makeup in one scene is too heavy and they corrected it in another but other than that a thoroughly enjoyable addition to my classics to pass on to the next generation. I grew up with this version, I get a kick out of the commercial break areas that they left the commercials off... it's a wonderful classic that brings back the memories when the family would gather Sunday night as a whole to watch Disney, or Hallmark, or anything Musical.  I think the dress for Cinderella in this film is so much more beautiful and flowing than the one done in Whitney Houston's rendition.  Just enchanting! After watching the movie Julie Julia I got the DVD's and plan on making this challenge myself.  I got both her original books and very easy reads.  The DVD's are fabulous...I love it when she makes bread and beats the stew out of the dough..even my son got a charge out of watching her. this was my first drive in movie to see as a kid...Ok I told my age but this classic never goes out of style and the acting/story/dancing are fabulous Wonderful memory and had to have in my collection Good work out.  You either like her or you don't.  Injured my back doing P90 so I've not been able to do this video in a while.  I like working out in the privacy of my home.  I can go fast or slow but for now I'm doing my Total Gym until my abs are stronger to support my torso. this was my first drive in movie to see as a kid...Ok I told my age but this classic never goes out of style and the acting/story/dancing are fabulous Wonderful memory and had to have in my collection Good work out.

I can go fast or slow but for now I'm doing my Total Gym until my abs are stronger to support my torso. At first I couldn't stand the movie or get in  it....then one day I guess God said it was time to watch it.  Faith has to real, deep and faith needs needs to be like being able to ""feel it, smell, injest it, live it....  This movie is about that.  Definitely listen to the commentaries in the extras.  Well worth the purchase and true story... Love the movie, acting, story line....And the guys - YUMMY on several!  Lead Actress is excellent.  Once had a boss like her and she was/is a mini dymo on wheels.  Both the same height but a power cruncher.  EXCELLENT Movie. I saw this horse run his Triple Crown.  This movie is as wonderful as this horse.  Man O' War was my favorite until Secretariat.  Both of them ""Big Red"" horses.  The acting is superb.  Get ""Life"" magazine on Secretariat.  It compliments this movie.  This movie is very good! Ok so Lincoln as a vampire hunter and wife a strong woman showing her strength in the end.  Loved it for the fun and the superhero fantasy that it was.  Well scripted with a lot of imagination.  To take one of our greatest Presidents and give him some mysterious alter ego was fun! Once again Hallmark makes an evening at home worth the time to relax, laugh, regroup, and smile.  Cute movie, Clean, loved the pranks....reminds me of my Navy days when we'd prank the Air Force...more like irritate them :o) but then the Army didn't like my sign on their recruiting door, ""step carefully doggy crossing"" that was up all weekend.  All in good fun!  Good Family movie...sensitive, caring, fun, irritating well written. Again watching another series on Amazon has been incredible.  The price is right and the shows are the best.  Years ago I wanted to be a officer of the law; my other choice was to join the Navy during Nam.  I went Navy but always respected and admired officers in law enforcement.  Thoroughly enjoying watching the dynamics and the quality of the show and getting it WITHOUT commercial interruptions. I heard people say it wasn't very good.  It's a mythological character and the film is pretty good.  Not the best but I thoroughly enjoy it as another mythological movie and I loved the action. Excellent more realistic than the original Hollywood version of Tarzan w/Johnny Weissmuller but seemed more realistic in animal, human behavior.  Well done and worth owning for action, adventure, and the English stiff upper lip!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AX8KBZ2DPPS1A," I really enjoyed watching the ""Monolith Monsters"" movie on VHS. I would love to buy the DVD version of this movie. I also would love to see a remake of this movie. This movie ""The Void"" keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is about the arrogance of ignoring the warnings regarding the safety of new equipment designed to create a new source of energy, the lengths some would go to prevent those concerns being brought to the knowledge of the government and those who find themselves preventing a great disaster at the risk of their own lives. This show ""Ghost Hunters"" is one educational show. It shows that, while there at times are natural explanations for some things, there are times when this group finds that spirits do exist at a place. I greatly enjoyed watching ""Saludos Amigos/The Three Caballeros"" DVD. I have never laughed so hard watching those two cartoons. It was also very educational in that there was a lot of Spanish words used during each cartoon. I would love to see an updated version of these cartoons from Disney in the near future.

I am so glad that I was able to obtain the DVDs of this show. It is one show that I would love to see renewed sometime in the near future. I am so glad that I was able to obtain DVDs of this show. It is a new take of the Sherlock Holmes saga and one that I would love to see continued in the near future. This movie is a sci-fi murder mystery where a former doctor and an F.B.I. agent join forces to find out how people are being turned to stone only to find out there is a much bigger threat to come. This movie ""Wishcraft"" keeps you on the edge of your seat. It bases its main theme on the old saying ""Be careful for what you wish for"" and the consequences coming from not being careful of what wished for. I really enjoyed watching this movie. It showed the consequences of letting revenge consume one's life. I especially liked the ending where the mystic tells the others that there are consequences when using something for evil as it will lead to one's destruction. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. I also highly recommend this seller to anyone. I just LOVE this DVD. I just wonder if they, Cartoon Network, could do the same episode combinations for Season 1, 2 and 3. I am looking forward to when Cartoon Network puts the complete (all 10 episodes) Ben 10 Omniverse Season 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 all out on DVD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AHPZM2KVOXRXS," I thought I had seen all the war movies there were.  I missed this one-and I am sure glad I found it!  This is a moving story of 3 servicemen coming home after WW II.  The coming home is the great part-the being back home is the hard part!!  I saw a side of the post war era I had never thought of before!!A GREAT FILM!! This is one of the most inspirational movies I have ever seen!, the true story of a young girl who grew up in poverty and became the nations best singers!  The cast is outstanding and do a very great job!  You will not regret getting this movie!! I am glad it finally came to DVD!  I have been wanting to watch this movie for years!  It was what I expected it to be-a good, old, cheap horror film!  I enjoyed it very much!  Glad I bought it! The war buff must add this film to their collection!  This is a true story and follows a British ship from beginning to end!  A really good film you will enjoy watching over again! The silence of the lambs was a twisted movie, with a lot of gore and horror!  This sequel is just like the first!  Full of gore and horror.  Anthony Hopkins is at his best, but Starling is not as good.  If you enjoyed the first you must see this one too! This is a must see for the lover of WW II movies!  This is a true tell of some of the most daring adventures of naval history!  A very good film of very brave men!! This was a classic show when it began to air many years ago!! It has just gotten better with age!!  The stories are all well written with many great actors in each episode!!  I remember waiting for every 3rd Sunday night to roll around so I could watch columbo, as the show rotated with 2 other mystery shows!  It is great to be able to view them again!! A very good black and white movie of a terror filled time in English history!  The mystery has never been solved and that leads to the wonder of this awful crime spree!! My father was stationed on the Antitiem when this film was filmed!  He told me about the movie and I had to look awhile for it!  We watched it at Christmas time and we both really enjoyed it!  Many real war footage was used in the film!  A must have for the war buff! I stumbled upon this film by accident!  It was a real good war picture!  The plot, acting, and history was quite interesting!  I would highly recommend it to the war buff!! This was a nice film-just not what I expected!  This goes into the defense of the emperor of japan after the war is over!  I thought it would have more to do with General MacArthur!  All in all-still a good film! This is a story that is worth telling!  To see the courage of this dear man and all he went thru to save his crew from danger is moving!!  You will not be able to stop once you start this film!  It starts off fast and picks up steam as it goes!!  The best part is it is based on a true story! This was a very good movie about the life of a larger than life man!  John Goodman does an outstanding job of relaying his character to the audience!  You will enjoy this film about old, southern politics! This movie is a moving study of the yet to be solved mystery of the ripper.  This happened during one of the most terrorizing times in English history.  A good film!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AA9BZ5Q8O22RL," I saw this on TV and decided to get it to show the family every Thanksgiving.  It has great acting and it is very realistic in it's approach to the journey to America.  I will show it at school as well. My two year old loves Big Bird!  I like that I can put him on at any time. The story line is cute but I would like more instruction to be able to follow it.  Great for toddlers! I wanted my grand daughter to see this but after previewing it, I think I will wait until she is at least 10 years old and has heard about Martin Luther King and others who changed things for African Americans.  She is only four.  The acting is superb but the reality of the unfair treatment is too mature for a small child. I am a teacher.  I would show it to 4th grade and over. I was disappointed in all the talking and disjointed clips of Michael.  I wanted my grand daughter to see what a fabulous dancer he was but this DVD was in pieces and parts and not enough dancing.  I feel like I wasted my money.  I totally agree with the other one star review. I like this DVD because it is slow and relaxing.  The ocean waves make it easy to relax and the instructor's voice is easy to listen to.  The exercises are just what I needed for my back pain. I am 65.  It saved me a lot of money since the co pay on phyisical therapy was more than I could pay. Thank you. I loved the costumes and settings but the characters were not engaging.  Elizabeth wasn't passionate enough for me and her lover/friend was old and worn out.  I didn't feel a connection to this movie and I have seen every one I can about Elizabeth.  The blood and torture scenes got most of the director's attention.........I had to look away many times. Too much talking and not enough music.  I prefer the ones with lots of music that uplifts and calms you.  This one had a lot of conversation and repeated phrases.  Sorry. This movie was disjointed, poorly acted, confusing and unbelievable.  The scenery was realistic but the action was disconnected and just plain weird!  It reminded me of the classes I taught in Middle School Drama............only not as good as some of the plays we put on with 12 year olds.  We went to sleep half way through it. Again, a DVD that was put together from clips of musicals I knew and some even Michael struggled with.  Don't bother with this one if you want to see his best dances and best songs. Jane Fonda is not afraid to admit that aging changes your body and exercises need to change too.  She looks great and still inspires me to keep working out at my own pace! This would be a great family night movie.  The characters are so unique and the plot is complicated enough to hold your interest. The special effects are great and the giants are huge and gross and really add to the fun of it! This would be a great family night movie.  The characters are so unique and the plot is complicated enough to hold your interest. The special effects are great and the giants are huge and gross and really add to the fun of it! Love the new Sherlock!  The stories are complicated with lots of twists and turns.  the characters are amazing and soooooooo real! The only thing I don't like is that they sometimes mumble and with the English accent you might have to go back and listen again. Of course you will hang on every word and be left amazed at how things work out! I thought this movie was exciting and full of great symbolism.  I loved all of the characters but I was a little confused by the weird people of the city at first.  The main character was believable and the plot was complex enough to hold my interest.  I want to see the first one now. This is a great little CD.  It was actually my second so I knew it was good.  We gave the first one away and replaced it with a used one that skipped and had major problems.  I should have bought another new one.  I would recommend it for ages 3-5!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AOHYZBTBQ5PN4," One of my all-time favorite legal venue films, the single best performance was delivered by Wilford Brimley, during the short but climactic ""Inquiry Scene.""  All actors rendered very creditable performances, and there were certainly no weak links.  Perhaps the classic ""getting even"" film! Many parts of the film were very good, while others bordered on the preposterous.  I liked Eastwood's character and performance, and Telly Savalas was predictably excellent.  But Donald Sutherland's role took away much of reality of the story, as he was an obvious anachronism - an out-of-time-and-place ""hippie"" who would not have been found in the Army.  Perhaps the most truly entertaining aspect of the film is Mike Curb's rendition of the theme. You cannot own and watch this delightful film without also owning and enjoying its companion story, ""On Moonlight Bay!""  These are thoroughly charming and is also eminently ""fit to watch"" - a rare commodity nowadays - films, and for those of us who are considered to be ""really old,"" and products of the Fifties, the nostalgia of the early part of the 20th century will bring some tears and some great dreams.  Enjoy to the fullest! This is probably my favorite of all the Agatha Christie films, and it has taken a long time to get it.  It has been well worth the wait, so it will reside among several other of my favorite dramas of all time, such as Laura, Witness for the Prosecution, and so on. This is an excellent film, especially for Agatha Christie fans.  While occasionally slow-moving, it still encourages the viewer to focus on the developing plot, in attempting to determine the eventual outcome.  As is the case with all Christie stories, this is the ""thinking person's novel and is well-worth the price, and the visual qualities are excellent. This film, despite its age and a little amplification of some facts, is just terrific.  I consider it to be a Stewart Classic, in every sense of the word.  I simply would not be without it. This was just another great nostalgia trip!  Considering the time that lapsed between their musical origins and successes, and the time the concert was performed, the Everly Brothers were almost as dynamic as when they began.  The vocal quality was very surprising, and they stayed within their contemporary ranges to maintain their legendary harmony.  This DVD was well worh waiting for, and some numbers raised goose-bumps. It took years to find this rare Richard Widmark adventure, and to find it to be in visually flawless condition, a great pleasure!  The story is perhaps a mild takeoff on the famous story, ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" but it is certainly ""its own story,"" and is well worth owning for Widmark fans.  Being able to find this one, and ""The Last Wagon,"" almost rounds out my favorite Widmark films. One of my all-time favorite James Stewart films, this is a very touching, exciting, tragic yet loving story about the evolution of the FBI, as told through the eyes and experiences of an agent (Stewart) who was a part of the entire development of the agency, from its very rough beginnings through its Cold War successes.  An excellent film that I am pleased to add to my collection. This DVD was beyond expectations, in terms of the quality of the product, and the customer service experienced.  I have been a fan of the Booth Brothers since I first watched them on the Bill Gaither Canadian Homecoming program, and the selections performed on this DVD simply reinforced my affection for these young men, whose harmony is just extraordinary.  All three of them have wonderful voices, and stage presence. While some of the acting in the film was quite ordinary, this fact-based film biography of Audie Murphy, the most highly-decorated soldier in US history, and portrayed by himself, is essential to the serious war film collector.  Murphy insisted that the scenarios presented in the film were factual, while some were, of course, dramatically enhanced for Hollywood consumption.  It is a fast-moving story and definitely enjoyable. I am a terrible ""nostalgic,"" and looked for this film for ages.  Featuring Jeff Chandler in the continuing role of the great Apache Chief Cochise, it is a sequel. Of sorts to the great western, Broken Arrow, that starred James Stewart and Chandler.  Though not quite as dramatic as Broken Arrow, it is still a good film for westerns fans, is in great condition, and well worth the money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2K53OYO4JJO28," Every has visons of Christmas morning - waking up, opening presents, But in 1776 Washington and te Continental Army crossed a nearly frozen Delaware River. This is that story. But this story goes into some personality traits and some of his men.  Highly recommended at a time when it has become chick to belittle our foundng father. A suspence story with a lot of interesting stories that make up the larger one. Unfortunately this film was overlooked by both the critics and public. Kathy Bates delivers a great perfrorance. When doesn't she? THIS COVERS THE APOLLO PROGRAM FROM THE PLANNING STAGE TO EACH FLIGHT INDIVIDUALLY AND A SPECIAL ON THE ASTRONAUTS WIVES. iNTERESTS NOT ONLY FOR THOSE INTO SPACE BUT ALSO THOSE THOSE WHO LOOK AT IT FROM A HISTORICAL VIEWPOINT. I did't know anything about this movie when I saw it and was quite surprised. It had an original concept and the characters were well played. I found it to be enjoyable and entertaining. Bogie is not often seen in comedies. This is a story that happens at Chrismas that becmes a form of a Chrismas story. Unusual situations lead to humorous  situations. Bogart, Ray and Ustinov bring unusal life into their characterizatons. A non-typical story of a man with four kids, 3 of whom weren't his, but his wife's by previsous marriages. But she has a wonderlust and keeps taking off with other men leaving a very busy man to juggle the time required for his job and taking care of the kids. It is a Kramer v Kramer time 4. The forgotten story of those left behind but  sweat out missions in their own stressful way. The story of the lonely  position of command and responsibiity that only the commander suffers -the lonliest job in the world Eating Raoul takes you on a trail never seen before. The most unlikely characters form a team to create a diffrent kind of comedy that is not only amusing, but funny This is a movie that made no sense to me. A man and his wife live in a desolae area with workmen completing work on the place. For no given reason, they attack the couple and violence encurs. This movie came from a period wihen Hollywood was rampant with movies from North Africa and India and this is one of the best. The story is two-fold. The first is of three brothers leaving England to avoid a theft. The second is the battle for survial, not aganst the Arabs, but against the leadership of their Foreign Legion leadership. The only movie I have seen that covered the start of the Korean War accurately. By way of newsreel footage, it shows the atrocities committed on captured U.S. soliders by the North Koreans. It gives the reason for the seemingly inhuman treatement of the refugees streaming south. The rest of the film is Hollywood in realistic but unconvining manner. Still enjoyable and entertaining. Men aren't supposed to like ""girlie"" movies. But I loved this one. Perhaps the man that CaryGrant plays is a man that most men would like to be. Ths is more than a love story - it is a story of real romance. As many times as I've seen it, I have tears in my eyes  in the last five minutes I find this 1956 verion surpeior to the the newer edition. Alexnder the Great tells the story of Alexnder fairy accurately and does so with a good story and character development. Unlike thenewer version, does not depend on special effects, but the story, cinema, an performances carry the day. Great story written to fit the clssic Tennisn poem, ""Charge of the Light Brigade."" Plenty of action with the requiste romance element, but not in the usual sence. The charge only makes up the few moments of the fllm highlihted by a voiceover of the reading of the poem while  you are watchingi it. A lawyer is successful because of the unethical practices of his law firm usually ripping off genuine victims. It takes a shot in the head which leads to rehabilitation for him to find his ethics. A story about the Boxer Rebelion in the early 1900's. Chinese Boxers lays seige on the internation commuity in order to force all whites from China. Good and realistic acton. Great costuming an intestng inside stories within the basic story. This version of Doctor Doolittle is more in line with the storys by Hugh Lofting. The special effects were in ine with the story and did not take ove the move. The work with the animals is fantaastic. An unuual story of a tank and it's crew. A tank commander is killed and the new tank commnder is a hard leader and interested only in resullts. The story is about the melding of the crew as they carry out their mission. Although race turns out to be the the impetus of the film, the film is not about race. It is a mystery. A diabled WW II veteran comes o town and stumbes upon a town secret. In order to forefll the reason he came to town, he uncovers the town secret. Outstanding performances by Spencr Tracy, Robert Ryan, Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Water Brennan and Dean Jagger. I cannot recommend this movie high enough This musical brought from teh Broadway stage - of George B. Shaw's ""Pygmalion"" is absolutely great. The plot has become familiar. But the costumes, songs and performances are fantastic. Watch Audrey Hepburn's treatment as her accent slowly evolves from a London street woman to an elegant sophisticated woman. Really a good movie with a good blend of Brithih and American humor. Excellnt cast and the move got good reviews. But for one reason or another, it didn't catch my fancy. Stil I recommend a viewing and make up your own  mind. Reeves best peformance since Speed. goverment project goes awry under the direction of the operatng head of the project. Reeves and another person becomes aware of the situation and tries to stop it. The overall head of the project (Morgan Freemam) orders the halt to the project but to no avail. This historic event is depicted fairly accurately,  base on accounts I have read and a documentary on the Military History Channel.  Great location and enough suspense to keep you in the story. One error in the movie is that the movie gives the impression that the succesful operaion ended the German project. It did not. Still that not detract from this very  good movie. The 1950's was the birth era of the true sci-fi - in all classics. This was one of them, I believe this was Steve McQueen's first movie - or at least his first starring role This film is not for everyone but is aimed primarily for the pre and early teens. A great movie for them. No foul language, nothing suggestive and only humor very appropriate for the pre and eary teens. Really a good movie with a good blend of Brithih and American humor. Excellnt cast and the move got good reviews. But for one reason or another, it didn't catch my fancy. Stil I recommend a viewing and make up your own  mind. I found this movie not only to entertaiing but an interestng presentaion on the life of Christ. The senery was excllent as wa the costumig which both could have been overdone, but the simpliciy was in tune with the story. I watch this every Easter Here is the story of the first successful submarine attack that occurred during the Civil War. Add to the fact that Hunley was refloated and is now on display in Charleston, South Carolina. A cross between sci-fi and space. The action is adequate and the story line is week. The squences on Mars is tinted red like Rocketship XM IN 1952. Still, all in all it is entertainig movie An OK movie to just sit back and watch and kill an hour and a half. No surprises, the Magnificient Seven theme has been done to death. But there are worse movies. Eating Raoul takes you on a trail never seen before. The most unlikely characters form a team to create a diffrent kind of comedy that is not only amusing, but funny Using known geological science, topography and fault lines, the movie then hypothesizes a very improbable, yet very possible scenario. of a quake involveing the interaction between fault lines running from the State of Washingto to California experiencing a 10.5 quake which threatens breaking the entire west coast either in two or into the ocean. In this particular volume, I had seen one before and the other three were as entertaining as I expected. These are the kind of mysteries I grew up with. No unnecessary useless violence and foul language - but still great entertainment. It i difficult to evaluate several movies under one umbrella. I have the whole series, and every one generally has a good entry, a notso good entry and the rest aveage entries. This s one of best because it contains a Basil Rathbon Sherlock Holmes Like all the offerings of the Mytery series,  volume7 is difficult to rate as evey volume usually has one good movie, one not so good and he rest in the middle range. If you enjoy the early myterys devoid of special effects, foul language, unnecessary violance and blood, you can't go wrong on any of the Mystery series. The movis in the Mystery Classics bring home my chilhood movie going and early TV. This volume is features the Bulldog Drummond series, whch was also a radio show. Typical formt for the period and I found this volume very entertainig. Murder without gore and violence. Fun mois This movie about a giant earthquake on the West Coast that is so huge that it affects all the fault lines from Washington State to California. Although improbable, geologically, it is entirely possible. Makes one wonder. Ultimate satire that equals the Naked Gun series. Classic sight and verbal gags that will keep you in stitces. Charlie Sheen has joined Leslie Nielsen and Lloyd Bridges as the kings of satire. The Micael Shayne series is not up to the other series, but stll enjoyable and entertaining. Although well acted, there is something misising in the story line. I can't put my finger on it. But if  you are a mystery fan,  you will like the series An interesteing twist of man fooling with nature theme. The concept is good but the  this time man messes with marine biology i search of a new type of weapon. Entrtaining. If I remember correctly, This is the first of the mystery series. This series is interestig as in many cases, they start off some actors who later become big names in thiends inthe industry. Ths volume is remarkable in that it is the only volume to have an episode of ""The Shadow."" Nice revisits to the movies we usd to see at our loca neighbood movis and early TV. Simplistc and sometimes forseeable plot, but stll entertaining without excessive blood, violence, rough language and revealing of the human body. Again, the difficullty of evaluating one of the mystery series is difficlult because most of the time the selections are diffeent. Some straight mystery, some on the verge of horror, and some wit a comic twist. The story was about a real person, but I was disapointed in the movies lack relationship to the social sttuation in Spain at time. The scenes and color were excellent and peformances were what we've come to expect frm the featued actors. Undoubtedly, all all the films are really good - as is normal for a compilation - but growing up with Charlie Chan and being a big fan - I could not in good conscience rate it any lower.

Undoubtedly, all all the films are really good - as is normal for a compilation - but growing up with Charlie Chan and being a big fan - I could not in good conscience rate it any lower. An unusual look at the litte knon afects of being a prisoner of war. Presened at a time when these psychological effects were relatively unknown. Outstanding mvie about a difficult subject. An OK movie. Not as good as I had anticipated. Frankly I didn't know what to expect. Perhaps it was true to life - perhaps not. But I felt let down by the movie I love the Charlie Chan series - both wit Warner Oland and Sidney Toler. There isa distinct difference with the Toler seres having a bit more comedic touch. For me,  you can't go wrong wih Charlie Chan. Abbtt And Costello movies can be divied itnto three classes - great, average and not so good. ""It Ain't Hey"" is in the middle of average. It is the antics of Costello that keeps the weak script alive. But throught all this, it is a movie where you can just sit back and enjoy. This collection is primarily for those of us who remember the series from Saturday at the neighborood theater and later from TV. Seen from time to tme on TCM. Being a collection, there some good movies and some just average. Stil, everyone provides an excuse to just lay back and enjoy and be entertained. Some movies not the best of quality but decent presentation. I a disappointed in the fact no schedule of the movis ar given. You don't know what movies are on what disc. Very irritating. I must admit I was somewhat disappointed in this movie. Having seen (and own) the orginal TV movie, ""TheTuskeege Aiman), I found Red Tails lackluster and I had difficulty keeping my attntion on the movie. Perhaps it would be a more effective for someone who is not familir with the group. A good collecton of the Falcon series,some of which is occassionaly seen on TCM. The series is ably planned to include an explanation of the change of ""Falcons"" in ""The Falcon's Brother"" which introduces the ""inoming Falcon."" Stories are very interesting which I will watch where there is nothing on TV (most of the time). This collecton contaned three of my favorite Bogart films. One in particular is so little known and yet is chock-full of acton. Two others are seen infrequently onTV and the fourth, although not one my favorites, it typcal ""Boggi."" An outstanding eductional tool for young kids. Yet the colors an animation will be so enjoyable to young kids that won't realize they are learning. Ol' Ben Franklin hits a mental block and a warward mouse helps him invent things like the Franklin Stove, bifocals, ec. Without realizing it, they are finding out about some of Ben' inventions Like all compilations, there is a range of movies from good to not so good. Probably contains some you never heard of. Like the range, the quality also veries from movie to movie. Still, it OK for the price",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2TY359PR45ATP," ""I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me."" Philippians 4:13  That is an actual quote from Bethany Hamilton (played by AnnaSophia Robb) the young championship surfer, who lost an arm to a shark and made a remarkable, near miraculous comeback to compete again...at the championship level.  This is an inspiring, heartwarming story of faith for all ages. This is Charlie Chaplin's classic satire of Hitler and Mussolini.  Truly a historic film as it was the first one to seriously address Hitler's plan of conquest...including his planned extermination of the Jews.  Plenty of dark humor, and some parts are outrageously funny...but the overall message is deadly serious. I had all three of these films in the old video cassette format; but wanted to update them in BluRay format.  This package of the Matrix Trilogy is superb...exactly what I was looking for. All Astaire/Rogers musicals are magical and this package includes their best.  Watch as Rogers matures as an actress and a dancer...Astaire was always outstanding, from his first film to his last.  My highest recommendation! I love Westerns, and I had not seen any of these three classics.  What a joy it was to watch them...especially ""The Gunfighter"", which is not only a fine Western, it is an outstanding movie in any genre. I love Westerns, and I had not seen any of these three classics.  What a joy it was to watch them...especially ""The Gunfighter"", which is not only a fine Western, it is an outstanding movie in any genre. The one word to describe this film: PHENOMENAL. Every aspect of The Kings Speech was beautiful. The score perfectly sets the mood. The casting was perfect. Colin Firth was astounding! He more than deserved his Academy Award! The period costumes and architecture were striking and impressive. Firth and Rush's portrayal of an old-fashioned bromance was entertaining and touching. The build-up to the climax was suspenseful. Every shot was a work of art. Fantastic movie. This is an enjoyable science fiction actioner, with a fairly plausible plot for this type movie.  It also has excellent acting, both the live actors and the voice acting for the Transformer robots.  Only beef is that it's language makes it inappropriate for tweens and pre-teens.  Overall, excellent for adults and recommended. What an incredible treat for silent movie fans, and what a great introduction to the medium for those who've never watched a silent movie. The director, writers and actors obviously love the genre, and they do it proud - loved every minute of this movie. And Uggy - even if the rest of the movie was only mediocre, it would be worth seeing just for the charm and charisma of the dog. Wonderful film! I love both these films and it has long been a tradition in our family to watch each one every holiday season.  Having them both on DVD in one package just makes the viewing experience easier.  Love it!! Starts slow but builds to a great cliffhanger. Highclere Castle provides a stunning backdrop to the series. Great performances from Dame Maggie, Hugh Bonneville, Penelope Wilton and Brendan Coyle, as usual. Creator Julian Fellowes is quickly becoming my favorite ""content provider"". Can't wait for the next series which begins filming in January. There has been some criticism that it recycles storylines from Upstairs, Downstairs, but as I haven't seen it...doesn't bother me. Season 3 of the series continues the excellence established in the first two seasons.  I buy very few TV series DVD, preferring to rent most rather than buy; but I've made an exception for this one as I expect to enjoy repeat viewings of this one. These are B-production films and mostly film noir.  But just because they are low budget, doesn't mean they are not good.  Here you'll get a chance to see Robert Mitchum early in his career and Glenn Ford, who is almost always good.  The individual ratings for the films range between 3 and 4 stars; but I give the package and overall 4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A30WFYKC1210LA," A really great movie that keeps you riveted.  Does a great job at depicting just how ragged and ill Washington's troops were by this point in the war.  When you see just how close the entire endeavor was to defeat it makes you astounded that we sit here now 50 states strong.  With this one offensive Washington truly snatched victory out of the mouth of defeat. I absolutely love all four of these Maragaret Rutherford as Miss Marple movies.  She is the best actress to ever play the roll.  The supporting cast in each movie is top notch also with lots of twists and turns.  Finally, the score written for the movies is great.  I bought all four of these on DVD, then had to get them again on instant video so I could watch them on my phone. I video recorded this series many years ago when PBS broadcast it and was looking forward to the release on DVD.  Its clearly the best of the ""house"" series public television did.  But $147.00 for a series nearly 19 yrs old is ridiculous!  I think $50.00 would be much more fair price.  Even though the picture is not nearly as good as DVD, I will have stick with my old VHS tapes. These movies are classic who-dunnits where all the suspects are gathered together at the end so the detective can make his grand summation of how the crime was committed and by whom.  They are really fun and you'll recognize lots of old Hollywood stars in them.  My problem is I have read all of Agatha Christie's books so I already know who did it.  I still like them anyway. Buy this video if you are one of those Very coordinated people who have had years of dance classes.  Otherwise, this is difficult and a bit too hyper for most people.  The moves change so rapidly that its actually WORK trying to keep up and it just gets frustrating. I bought this for my adult son's birthday.  He loved the series so much on Youtube that he wanted the boxed set.  This one was MUCH less expensive than the US version and he has had no problems watching it on his computer.  He has not tried it on his DVD player. I bought these for my Dad since he is hooked on this series, but now of course, after paying all that money for Series 1-4 all of them came out on Netflix & Hulu!!!  Figures. The last of the series, and some say the least quality of the four, but I really like it.  The actor who plays the captain, Lionel Jeffries, I think his name is, really adds a comic touch to the whole thing.  I wish they had made more of these b/c she was the best Miss Marple ever. Bought these for my grandkids and it was a hit.  These are the old classics from when I was a kid and to be honest, I wanted them for myself too. Its great to have this beautiful video in the background as I study.  You can choose music or natural bubbly ocean sounds.  The coral scenes change regularly so you never tire of the view.  Its a little pricey but worth every penny. Bought these for my grandkids and it was a hit.  These are the old classics from when I was a kid and to be honest, I wanted them for myself too.

It has a very interesting and compelling story that is a mystery, science fiction, thriller, and family movie.  It does have some scary scenes that I would not let anyone under 14 or 15 view.  If you liked such films as Close Encounters of the Third Kind or E.T., you will like this. Bought these for my grandkids and it was a hit.

A37PPLULHT6CFQ," No close captions! No subtilies! pissing me off still.. end up gave that dvd to my mom. I love this movie.. I remember when I saw it on television once... man! freaking pissing me off when found out has no captions! I think this movie should and probably will be one of the classic movies in several years later. Its one of the greatest movie... Im totally Final Fantasy fan. Played every one of FF games... It is awesome movie. Very good movie, you would like it if your guys are fan of fantasy. Im glad that I finally own this movie, Its always better to have hard, real thing than download movies and save in computer file. I have all seasons... all good... this one is special case because you can hear it everytime you press certain spot on case... it make a sounds. Good shows... funny... with endless laughs. I used to watch this anime when I was young, always fantasizing that I had some kind of supernatural power like Yu yu has. Its funny and awesome anime which packed with comedy and actions also not to mention dramatic too. I own all four season of yu yu haksuo. Good anime. Great... subtitles work good, graphic is all good. nothing wrong with it. Own all seasons... great shows... about a genius kid were kidnapped and worked/live at some kind of think tank company... and forced to solves things for the company until ran away and help people while searching for parents. Good shows. I have those old bulky dvd box set of 3rd rock sun shows but one.. Season 6... haven't got it... it is way smaller and simpler than those old dvd sets.. but still it is pretty much same and has all 6 disc? or 5 whatever it said on page.. it has everything. It is good price. I like it. Show are great.. always hilarious... you will die from laughing too much. Very good movie! I cant help but keep laughing. Robert De niro and Ben stiller work together very well. Normally I don't really like ben stiller but whatever... It is good movie...hope for more sequels. But I think this is it. SO funny and dramatic movie just same as first and second movie. WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!!!! So good anime. Love it... wonderful storyline, and characters building. But still I expected some point it should be better than what it was showed though... but still all good. As I said on subject line... Manga are defiantly way more better than anime. You would want to watch anime first before reading.. that what I did... it made it more interested. I rather not to explains things in details but one thing I could say it is a super anime. Its something unquie and enjoyable. the story are good. plot are twisted and interesting. IT has subtitles and it runs good. So funny, quirky, cute, a lot of humors in it. I rather enjoyed this anime when I feel down.  nice package, come with 4 discs... nice cover. Looking good. Arrived on timely. Its all good. Really good thriller movie. I own all series from 1 to 6, and saw this and bought it! so exicited to put on my dvd collection. Anyways the story are pretty same but still different as other each series... but fabulous, just fabulous... good movie. Cant help but loving this anime. It is definatly so different than usual anime... this generic couldn't fit in general types... It has it own unique sets...tales...wonderful characters. Very brilliant developmental. Im serious it is really brilliant combine of interact myths, money and fights into one story. Very good anime! Other than that... the artbox was wonderful desgined... I was glad that I bought this than completed set. Awesome anime. Made my heart tender. the end of anime is alright, but from beginning to few espiodes before the end was totally good, smooth plots, great lovey dovey sences. Really good shows. COLLECTION SET! Oh great...its better than having a part sets. I cant wait for three and rests. I really like fiary tale, its funny and wonderful anime. A lot of humors along with fights and good characters developmental. I love how they made it out as collections... now I am waiting for collection # three. I think this is more better than buying inivdual parts of chapters rather than all into one collection set. Beside that... it is great and funny also wonderful magical anime! Got it for brother's Christmas. He already had one... I bought it in two month advance before Christmas... but he has it... so now he has two...he say it was good show, one of his favorite show. TOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH $$$$$$ for piece of crap dvd case! no art box! BUT LOVE THE EXTRA AND DVDS AND STUFF IN IT just no artbox! that is so mess up! hope second part is better and have artbox for both! AND I won't buy this from this amazon! ill recommend you all buy at rightstuff.com they have better deals only with preorder stuff at great prices... however older or recently relases animes..recommend buy them through amazon... for better price! Its nice hentai. Enjoyable... I like either live action or hentai either way. But its very good show. Its about mother n daughter and her tutor... and end up getting into fight about guy and eventually got into sharing him. I didn't ever seen this show before I bought it... but the reviews and synpso piqued my curious. So I bought it and end up love this show. Great and added up to my collection. Artbox and other stuff are awesome! So funny... after first season and I had to watch second! so funny still.... I wish they have more espiodes... I cant tell which is more funnier first season or second... I just love both! very good shows... a lot parts are unanswered questions however I'm hoping there will be other season of it. It is pretty unique and different than usual fantasy anime. It is well made anime. I like the characters develops and I also like a idea how they develop the storylines. I LOVE THIS MOVIES... HOWEVER!!!! I'm uncertain of worthy to purchase this... due to mishap of # hours cramming in three disc along it said ""all unrated."" SO... I am waiting for proper reviews from others about this...if it was good as it claimed then I will purchase this. This is great show...but first one was better tho. there are a lot of missing when it come to last exile.. I really need to read light novels but unforuately its in all Japanese. So there are no English version yet... But this show is great... has subtitles. Its okay show... a lot a lot of sexs... the story line is okay... not really make sense at some point. but don't care because there are too many sex scenes...and its all fun to watch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2DO7HZPV0RGB8," I'm so happy a friend of mine told me these DVD's of Mae West were available on Amazon :) I'd forgotten how much I love her movies. Mae West was so ahead of her time.  She was an amazing woman. I'm so glad new generations will get to watch her work! this movie will not win any awards but it does give you a perspective of how we can cause a lot of our own problems from not allowing people to help us and take counsel from others. It shows us that woman still have a very high mountain to climb when it comes to being treated as equals with men. This movie could have been so much more, they really missed it here. I bought it because I want to see every film that Kris Holden-Ried has acted in but if you have no reason to purchase this film don't. I bought this for my husband because he became a big fan of 24 late in its production.  He absolutely loves the set and is in the process of watching it from the beginning.  He said it made some things make more sense to him that are in the show today.  I definitely recommend this set to anyone looking for a gift for someone or if you yourself like 24 and want to understand the show better. Story of the people staying at a seedy motel. Some of them you care about some of them you don't. I believe the were trying to be funny in places but it really didn't make it. You did feel empathy for a few of the people and others you wanted to smack. It is not an academy award winner by any stretch but it is a good movie for a day you've nothing better to do. I loved this movie. It definitely tugged at my heart strings. Well acted and well written. It shows what price was paid by some to save others and gave you a better understanding of the trials, turmoils and heart break these people who lived through the horror and what their families now have to live through and with.

So glad I ordered this set; I've watched all three and totally enjoyed them. Was a little worried I wouldn't like the original since I watch and like the Murdoch Mysteries done now in TO, but was pleasantly surprised to find I like the original as much as the recent ones. Peter Outerbridge played the role of Murdoch very well and the other actors fit the roles they played. A great movie to have on hand at Christmas time to keep the kids busy. Acting was good, plot was typical. Not going to win any awards but enjoyable to watch. I really like this version of this story. Not as grandiose as the original, but in my opinion that is what made it better.  I liked the fact that it happened in Jerusalem and not in Rome. I think the actors who were in this version made you feel more for the characters they portrayed and you felt you knew them better. I definitely recommend your buying. Season 2 of Lost Girl was not as good as Season 1 but it still has some really good episodes. If you are a Lost Girl Fan then don't hesitate to buy it. If you have never seen Lost Girl before then I recommend you purchase and watch Season 1 first. I love this show. It gives you a glimpse of how things were in the 1800's and how the world was progressing towards what is is today. My husband enjoys watching Murdoch trying to work with new discoveries and ideas in his police work. I can't wait until seasons 5-8 are available in a set. This is an awesome fun show! I am so glad they released it on DVD so those of us in the USA can see it. It made me sad when I heard that the 6th and finally season is now showing in Canada. I can't wait until the DVD of S6 is available so I can buy it :) I own S1 - S5 Great movie, well made and well acted.  If you like biblical stories on film you will love this one. Great directing and whoever picked the locations for filming did an awesome job. You feel like you are there with them in the Holy Land watching the story unfold. I know I will watch this film many times over and share it with my family and friends also. Why they changed the name from Textuality I haven't a clue. Sexting does not really fit. The sex was in person not on sexting on the phone. Texting is just used to hook up. It was a fun movie for an afternoon when you have some time to kill. If you like Kris Holden-Ried you will like his part in the movie.  He plays Colin really well, and you get to see a lot of him ;)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A173UMTWFAN2DV," This is a great, dark, film noir, with Griffin Dunne and Rosanna Arquette.  An unwitting guy leaves an unfulfilling job, enjoys a book, and then takes a girl's offer hook, line, and sinker.  Not exactly predictable.  :-) I've always loved this movie ever since I first discovered it.  Glad to see it made it onto DVD at some point.  :-)  Humorous & entertaining, unique, good music, and I think Yahoo Serious was perfect for the part.  :-) This is a creepy story, which I had no idea where it was heading in the beginning, or middle... and pretty much not until the end.  Like I said... a bit creepy.  Things don't work out for the original criminal, the way he might think they will.  And the homeowner who the bad guy invades?  Hmmm..... rather interesting himself.  ;-) This is a rather bizarre (yet entirely entertaining) older moive.  There's very little dialogue.  What minimal words there are, are in French.  It's about a guy (Hulot) who goes to a small beach resort for a holiday (i.e.; vacation), and all the assorted situtations he finds himself in.  Hard to put it all into words.  If you're into old-screen humorous entertainment, this might suit your fancy.  :-) Randy Quaid always adds a certain essence to the movies he's in; a bit of odd-ball humor.  Since he's one of the main characters in this one, the movie is definitely altered by his presence.  It's a little 'dark' and a little unsettling - or at least would be if it were happening to you!  (How could it be otherwise when you're trying to sell a dead dog?).  But nonetheless, dark, humorous, and entertaining. Okay... I'm probably the last person to have not seen ""The Ring"" yet... but I really enjoyed it.  It's a bit different than your average scary movie... having some obscure stuff in it, some cool sound effects, and a plot which is both cheap & childish, and yet scary and effective.  And I have to admit I'm a sucker for the ""scary effects""  :-) This is an excellent 1950's sci-fi flick by Jules Verne... where a few people vie for being first to descend to the center of the Earth.  Mystery, intrigue, sabotage, etc.  Very good special effects for that era... Great, though somewhat quiet & bizarre movie.  Not a very verbose movie... and often rather quiet... but at the same time sometimes rather violent.  Haven't quite figured it out yet... some of it seems rather surreal.  To some extent, the context has to do with Pagans vs. Christians. This is a great, modern action/drama flick.  LOTS of action; lots of things getting blown up.  Fast-action car chase scenes, etc....  I generally like Denzel Washington's movies, and this is no exception.  Saw it a number of times on the large cinema screen when it first came out. I love movies like this, which are a bit dark... and don't necessarily have a happy Hollywood ending every time.  This one takes place up in the great white north (Alaska, I believe), and shows weak men and strong men pitted against nature and wild animals, and focuses on the attempt of both parties to survive. I've given this a full 5-star rating.  Not that these are the best movies in the world... but they're fairly unique, and give some good/interesting insight into the drug/free-spirited culture of the 1960's.  I'd say they're worthwhile, if nothing else.  :-)  The on-line purchase experience was excellent.  :-)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ARYWKFOWV7BFD," I have always enjoyed this picture, World War II PT Boat crews at the onset of the War. Great action, very Patriotic in theme despite highlighting how ill prepared US servicemen were basically left on their own as the Japanese invaded. This is a mini-series detailing the birth of, (with all the formidable difficulties encountered), and the amazing exploits of the very first United States Olympic Team! If you love the Olympics you will love this all the more! A very young Don Johnson shines as Vic, wandering a post apocalyptic America with his Dog, who talks to him and is the intelligent one! Tim McIntire voices the dog, Blood!  suspenseful and clever story with some very humorous moments! A long time favorite! Caught this one on Cable as I was scanning channels. A love story develops between two young ladies, one from a more traditional upbringing(On the surface.) despite having divorced parents, the other from a Lesbian household. Quirky but fun. I love this movie, which I learned later did not do well at all in the theaters which is sad. It so obviously suffered severly at the hands of whomsoever editied it. I have long wished that they would come out with an extended version of this movie. It has the kernel of a truly wonderful movie within it! A great cast, a nice story about a bunch of late twenty-early thirty somethings from a smallish town getting together for their 10th year High School reunion. A great role for very young Natalie Portman, as always. History is very often skewed by the teller. This story is among the very best of Walt Disney's versions of American History! Not wrong, never completely correct, but I grew up on it and have always loved it, if anything this is the type of history that will fire your childrens imagination and get them reading further! I love her in this movie!!!!!  She always plays a strong woman and this picture is not an exception, but in this one she shows a bit of vulnerability that was very endearing and makes you want to pick her up and give her a hug! A very young Don Johnson shines as Vic, wandering a post apocalyptic America with his Dog, who talks to him and is the intelligent one! Tim McIntire voices the dog, Blood!  suspenseful and clever story with some very humorous moments! A long time favorite! This movie was a Staten Island story filmed in Staten Island, the characters could have been the people we who live here all knew when growing up, they were like our parents and their friends. An unlikely love develops between a married man and a woman who gives birth to an African American baby, in that era of course frowned upon. I love this movie....I love people who follow their hearts and dreams despite what others may think. This is one instance where I do not really wish to try and put into words my feelings about a show. The reason is simply this, nothing I or anyone can really do justice by this production with mere words. I had to have it after seeing it, I watch it over and over. A great telling of a pivotal period in American and European history, as related by those who experienced it. Wonderful! Maybe the Greatest Mini Series ever!!! Loved the book, loved the mini series! Clavell provides a window into Asia and the Asian mind in every book he wrote and I read them all. Some of the other movie treatments of his works suffered, but not Shogun! I loved it! Whether you are a Boy Scout or not, you will love this movie. It is what America and Boy Scouting should be! Disney at his BEST!   I also, after years of loving this movie, tracked down and read the book, upon which the story is based, by MacKinlay Kantor. It is available under two names, the movie title, and its original title, ""God and My Country."" I found this a wonderful read which enriched the movie experience for me. One of those movies where I find I enjoy the sequel even more than the original.........despite the lip synching which is not really noticeable....I  wish these guys were a real band, I love the music and had to track it all down! Another excellent story from HBO about a fascinating Founding Father. I love another window into American Revolutionary history. While I might have enjoyed more scope of some of the events, the point of view telling of the story, which was primarily told through the eyes of John and his wife Abigail, was a very interesting way to tell this story!

A2F2HASXLTX9ER," SO many people have done great reviews.  My heart goes out to the soilders who were freezing, had no food or shoes. If one stops and thinks about the sacrifices of 1700's americans, it makes you appreciate more than ever all your blessings. I admire the revolutionary generation (more than anyother generation)for their bravery and laying ground for americans 200yrs later. it made me see just what indiviualist we americans are.  Like, a  lovable loose cannon that can inflict pain if necessary.  TCM ROBERT OSBORN SAID THIS WAS A TRUE STORY. a movie well worth watching. GREAT ACTORS. i have had massages, chiropratic adjustments for tight(spasm) and painful muscles.  i bought kathys STRETCH vhs at Thrift Store, it does the trick, after doing the entire tape my muscles feel relax and the pain is gone.  these exercises can be done by almost anyone and  any age they are so simple and gentle.  For Me, these exercises are as effective as a neuromuscular massage. This is a great- mini movie, it rates up there with War and Peace. The Winds of War is equally good.  They are long and i enjoyed every moment watching them. what i got from UNITED 93 is...TO DO NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION FOR THE WESTERN WORLD.  the people on united 93 are an inspiration and i am so thankful to them for fighting the sons of the devil terrorist. DEA agents risk their lives,some are killed,their sacrifice is  swept under the rug by Mexican and American Gov....mexico owes american banks billions of dollars, pay banks millions in interest, this is the reason American president and gov. in 1985 wanted the  focus on domestic drugs not foreign because america does not want to upset foreign gov.....guess the same goes for Americas unsecured borders......... COULD PASS FOR A TRUE SOUTHERN WOMAN.(I HAVE LIVED IN DEEP SOUTH ALL  MY LIFE..EXCELLENT ACTING. ALL ACTORS PLAYED THEIR PARTS SO CONVINCING  IT WAS AS THOUGH YOU WERE IN 1864.  GREAT DIRECTING/CINEMATOGRAPHY/MUSIC.  THE SEX SCENES ARE VERY GRAPHIC. i enjoyed this movie, tells a warm felt story of everyday americans' struggles, such as, being a preacher whose wife left him and her three yr. old little girl, this little girl finds her a friend (dog who is clearly an excellent actor)  at supermarket and calls him winn dixie, together they bond with small community, funny, sad and truthful....on a scale of 1-10, this is a sure 9...........LOVED IT..... matt damon is a great actor and brings realism to any role he plays. the mexican prisons were bare and gritty,the land is barren beauty. The movie  depicts the wild rough and tough west.  There were enough love scenes with  ms. cruz to soften things for  women viewer .  i gave movie  a  high score because i enjoyed movie and thought it was a good western. i am a female who loves and have watched many western movies. THIS VIDEO IS EASY TO FOLLOW.  I HAVE 2 DOG TRAINING VIDEOS BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE, COMMAND PERFORMANCE IS THE MOST SIMPLE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND, ANYONE CAN TRAIN A DOG WITH THESE VISUAL DIRECTIONS....EXCELLENT. i am a senior citizen with back pain. as soon as i received my dvd i started my tia chi dvd and with the warm up my back pain eased.  easy instructions, however i also have vhs tai chi for health by life style (amazon), a great step by step video. the feet and hand movements are shown front, side, back and step by step. both videos have helped me feel better. i am 71yrs and recommend both videos. I think the Actors do a very good job in bringing viewer into movie, i found myself very envlolved with how i feel about the different subjects they were discussing;  many deep and emotional subjects such as atheist/believers, morality/money/immorality/capitalism/communism and etc.  i enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. call and mcrae (actors) were faithful to tommy lee jones and robert duvalls method of acting, the characters in comanche moon and lonesome dove stayed very true and it was like watching call and mcare when they were young and old. excellent actors and movie... had a very real air to the movie, enjoyed watching, I think this is the best lonesome dove movie to date and too me all the Lonesome Dove movies were very good.

WHY WOULD HOLLOWOOD MAKE  AN AUTHENTIC MOVIE OF WWII GERMANS AND USE ACTORS WHO SPEAK WITH AMERICAN(TOM C.)&ENGLISH ACCENTS??? CRAZY.  STALINGRAD =GERMAN/RUSSIAN  WAS A MOVIE THAT ACTORS SPOKE GERMAN& RUSSIAN, MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO A MOVIE BUFF. by doing am yoga with rodney.  this is an easy yoga session, lots of good muscle stretches.  has helped relieve my back pain and i feel better. Video is well worth few dollars i paid. there are already  numerous,good  descriptive reviews of Savage Pampas, This movie is filled with action, from the bandits, indians, women , army and  the desserters.  A good movie that is  free of curse words, a movie  the entire family can enjoy. it has received some very good descriptive reviews already.  i bought my copy at Goodwill, it is not rated, yet, Gods name was defamed several times.  the f-word i can handle.....but, i continued to watch the entire movie. It makes one stop and think before going to a foreign country.  espcially one like russia or iran. i have vcrs and dvds, i am so glad i have vcr as i tapped cockleshell heroes on vcr. guess that is why movie companies want us to have dvd. a very good wwii movie. Many people have done great reviews on this movie.  good actors, beautiful scenery. i enjoyed this movie and actors, authenic scenery, director followed the Bible. the music is great, whoever she is , has a great voice, one can learn a lot about God from this movie. I enjoyed the looks people gave each other, said a lot..allows one to think. I  learned the actors are not actors but everyday people of Morocco. I was impressed with the entire movie, have watched quite a few times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3DPLF1J3ILMTO," When I tried to play this DVD on my bluray machine it says ""DuD"" When I tried to play on another combo DVD/VHS machine it says ""Incorrect Disc"" When I play it on anohter combo DVD/VHS machine it plays. This should play on all machines. It says it is ""enhanced"" so you would think it would play on my newest machine and not on the oldest. Disjointed, silly and hard to follow. Once again, how did this win all those oscars? My wife (a member of SAG) and I had trouble even watching this to the end. I loved the musical when it first came out. I looked forward to the film release. I can't say how disappointed I was in the result. Why do directors so often think they can make a better story than the author intended? I loved the musical when it first came out. I looked forward to the film release. I can't say how disappointed I was in the result. Why do directors so often think they can make a better story than the author intended? One item missed by the reviewers concerns why my hackles always rise when the topic are the so-called ""Christian"" academies. These schools were established in the 50s and 60s to avoid school integration. Notice how few minority faces are in the student body and the faculty. A number of reviewers here have done an excellent job in noting the strengths and weaknesses of the series. The historical inaccuracies and baises are unfortunate and avoidable. One more is just before the attack on Ticonderoga. An English soldier concerned about his fate is reciting the Lords Prayer. He uses the Roman Catholic version at a time when Catholics were not allowed to serve in the army. This was very disturbing to watch the growth of what can only be called theofascism in America. It was interesting to see Rev Haggard in Colorado Springs denounce homosexuals before he was caught with his own pants down. If the young Levi with his long hair was around when I was his age the strict conservatives of the time would have mocked him and probably shaved his head. To these people I say: Ich weiss genau was Ihr seid. I agree with the other reviewers that this was not a very good adaptation of GMF's work and poorly cast, at least the Harry Flashman role. One point that has not been mentioned: there is no ending. The end is just left hanging in the air!! The end of the book is side splitting but simple. Elspeth simply asks Harry after all his adventures, ""what did you bring me back from the continent?"" The blu ray version is not user friendly. You cannot go to the menu by pressing the menu key. At least, unlike the DVD versions, the no subtitle is the default, selection of the episode you want is very frustrating. To stop an episode and go on you have to shut it off, reload and then go back to the main selections. I still can't figure out how to get to any selection other than the first. I always loved this film.  I do wonder though why one of the most profound of Shaw's lines was cut from this film.  The centurion tells Livinia that her death will mean nothing. She answers ""then, why kill me"".  Not in the film. I remember watching this film when it first came out.  Delightful Mark Twain story well acted by Gregory Peck with excellent supporting cast. Good to see a film with a purpose and without excessive CGI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1ECB0HP9W99K6," This movie was well made, but had too much swearing in it. I understand that they were soldiers, but George Washington was a Christian and would not have spoken with so many profane words. We were only interested in the historical content of the film, but would only watch it once. I have loved this movie since I was a kid. I used to watch it on Disney channel every 4th of July. They always played it for America's birthday. I am sad my kids cannot watch it on Disney channel anymore, but they can watch it whenever they want now. Great story line. This is a great family film. I watched it as a kid, and now I am showing it to my 5 and 7 year olds. They love it! Toby doesn't feel wanted and useful at home- so goes out to make money to be a better help for his home. He finds out about true responsibility and how much family means to him. I was very skeptical at first to do a fitness program with weights. I thought my body couldn't take it. This program is GREAT for beginners and can be done with or without weights. I have recommended it to MANY friends. They have also purchased this video and loved it. I was surprised to sometimes combine the 3 mile walk with a 1 mile walk to go 4 miles. This video is nice to do any amount of miles. Combining walking with a fitness band is just plain smart! It is amazing how the inches come off when you couple the two together. Way to go AGAIN Leslie! Leslie Sansone's walk DVD's helped me to love to exercise and slim down. These four miles are fast, but you can still tailor them to your own needs. I like that. Leslie says that every exercise gadget that is ""new"" in her video is her favorite. The fact is that they are all good and helpful in toning and weight loss. I have recommended these videos to my friends. Leslie says that every exercise gadget that is ""new"" in her video is her favorite. The fact is that they are all good and helpful in toning and weight loss. I have recommended these videos to my friends. This is a good, clean & fun series. I like how they put the characters in a modern twist. I hope they intend to make a season 2.  I first saw it on the Dove Channel, but now purchased the season so I can watch it again & again. The movie is set in ""theatrical play"" style. It has a set stage and is a bit dated, but my children and I enjoyed it a lot. It has good actors and a nice flow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3DWO5RJDA430F," I purchased this DVD after seeing it on TV. It goes into detail on the true crossing of the Delaware by Washington and his troops during the crucial battle of Trenton, a turning point in the revolutionary war. There is a lot of bloodshed shown -just as it was in real life-.  This DVD may be more instructive than any history book, to a young person wishing to learn more about the revolutionary war. This is a little-known movie. Due to the studio's financial problems, it released four years after it was made. Jessica Lange and Tommy Lee Jones give great performances here. That alone is enough of a reason to watch this movie. Scott's acting is the main reason to watch this movie. Even General Patton's relatives applauded his portrayal of the real General Patton. It is unfortunate that the transfer to DVD was so poor. It looked just like a VHS transfer to DVD, it was flat, little contrast, and it had an overall ""muddy"" look to it. I am sure the theatrical release was very good, back in 1985. It was a pleasure watching the second season of Once and Again, right after I finished watching the first season. This show a=was very well done, good acting and very good production values from the producer. As the first season, it has funny moments, sad moments, as well as poignant moments that will bring you to tears. The DVD quality is excellent. This set of episodes from the first season bring back a lot of memories from those days in the 1980's when Robert Wagner and Stephanie Powers would strut their stuff every week, to solve mysteries/crimes in the space of 45 minutes. The DVD's are of excellent quality. I was eager to get these DVD's (3) and watch old TV commercials. The quality of the commercials is poor, even of the more recent commercials. The price was very low for all of these oldtime commercials, but I am still glad I ordered them. It's still a nostalgic trip down memory lane. I was very glad to see the great quality of these DVD's, much, much better than other low priced set of ""One Step Beyond"". The quality is, I suspect, better than when they were originally seen in 1959. An excellent choice!  Update 03/04/2014: The only thing missing in this 3 DVD set is a sheet summarizing each of the episodes. You have to look at each of the specific DVD's to find out the plot of each episode. An intelligent, mature look to the positive and negative aspects of having affairs. The actors are average looking, one of them even obese. Even though there was little nudity, the sexiness of the affair was titillating. Great cast, intelligent script and wonderful photography. The bulk of this movie's budget must have gone half for the computer effects, half for the stars' bloated salaries. DiCaprio is not, and never will be near the caliber of Redford. Mulligan is not the Daisy described in the novel. Mia Farrow was perfect. F. Scott Fitzgerald must be rolling in his grave seeing this cartoonish version of his masterpiece. These videos are of high caliber. First of all, having Walter Cronkite as the host already gives it credibility. This video will appeal not only to baby boomers, but it would be of interest to ypung people who were not around in 1969.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AE2SDFQQCDLED," ""Someday, you will write the story of our family."" The father tells his son in this film. That was a call to all of us to somehow record who and what we are--the story of your family. In the case of this family, a ""river ran through it."" What is it for you and your family? A deeply thoughtful, quietly inspiring film. The love story--predictable, not engaging, almost boring. The story of the ship? Powerfully engaging, beautifully depicted. Buy/watch this for the history, the ship, the costume, the characters--several of whom were real people. Watch it for most of the songs. Elvis and Ann Margret have great chemistry. Four stars for the majority of the songs. The movie, frankly, is terrible--more in the one to two star category. Great film! Once you get into studying the Battle of Gettysburg you realize there was so much going on in many different places, and this film covers only the main elements. But I can't fault it for that--what it covers it portrays very effectively. I have to give this film only three stars. My daughter is a horse expert and finds substantial fault in the film: the way the girls handle their horses in the beginning, some of the methods the ""Whisperer"" uses, especially exhausting the horse as a means of training, the quick resolution.  Montana looks beautiful--the film is beautifully photographed. Makes me want to go there (in the summer!). Great story, weaving American history with intrigue, puzzles, and a race around some of our most notable historic landmarks. Watch it before you go to DC, New York, or Philadelphia. This movie feels like an amusement park ride. Great fun! One (probably of several) historical inaccuracy: John Carroll was a Catholic; he certainly would not have been a Mason. OK, so it's stupid in parts. But hey, it's funny! It celebrates the ""common man,"" or kid in this case. Everyone has something that matters to him or her, and that's the point of this movie. Get it, don't think too hard about it, and just watch it. You may find yourself truly enjoying it! Creative; original even while adapting older songs from other eras and purposes. Great writing, acting, planning, singing. A very enjoyable telling of the Jesus story. Who was this man who changed the world? He rose from the dead? What does that mean? Fun to watch! Join this family as an immigrant mom and her daughter work with them for a time. We all have our quirks, but we are seeking the same thing: happiness, goodness, peace in our lives. I bought this on the recommendation of a friend. I see what all the hype is about. The show does a great job of drawing the viewer in. Character development is slow, but eventually they do become like friends to the viewer. The show is a product of its times--the anti-terror efforts after 9-11, and it fits well into that context. A different kind of movie--an aging widower father tries to reconnect with his adult children by visiting them in their various places, while searching for one of them that has gone missing. This film illustrates what we all know--life can be messy. I won't give away the ending, but I will say I didn't stay dry-eyed. Everyone knows that nearly all of Elvis's movies were pretty bad. This one, however, actually has a somewhat believable story. And it has charming qualities that others did not--an engaging child character as Elvis's sidekick, Ursula Andress, fresh from her Bond experience, and beautiful scenery in Mexico. A plus is the Latin-themed music, which seems to work well for Elvis, who of course is in great voice. A fun movie! If you like history, if you like Civil War history, you will LOVE this miniseries. Engaging, factual, human, touching. Beautifully put together. The music is also wonderful. As another review noted, you will laugh, you will cry. You will want to know more about this haunting, defining period of American history. SPOILERS FOLLOW. I feel bad giving this episode only three stars. My family and I are huge Sherlock fans. The 1895 mystery was introduced well; it was intriguing and even a little scary. Then it was wrapped up rather too easily by Holmes. The interplay between modern day and the 19th century was confusing and developed nothing in the way of the current series. Great story, weaving American history with intrigue, puzzles, and a race around some of our most notable historic landmarks. Watch it before you go to DC, New York, or Philadelphia. This movie feels like an amusement park ride. Great fun! One (probably of several) historical inaccuracy: John Carroll was a Catholic; he certainly would not have been a Mason. It's a made for TV movie, so have low expectations. It was fun to watch as a family and laugh at the character foibles, the predictable plot, and the utter lack of character development. There were a few fun, quirky things, such as the lead male's affinity for speaking Italian, and one of the love interest's lactose intolerance. It looked like everyone involved was having fun, which made it at least tolerable to watch. I'm a big fan of JFK, but I never really knew the story of the PT 109. I do now. This tells JFK's story alongside the story of searching for the boat. Very engaging and worthwhile. Robert Ballard is a good guide--so much of what he does I find interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3F2JUHM6C9RZ9," Disappointing, to say the least.  Unfortunately the filmmakers have chosen to turn President Ford into some sort of cinematic action hero when the opportunity was there to do a thorough examination of his mishandling of Watergate.  Shame, shame... Superstar Neil Diamond ignites the screen as the charismatic son of a disapproving cantor, (Laurence Olivier, in a near-perfect performance), who has a way with a song in this rocking update of the Al Jolson classic.  Luci Arnaz is on hand as the sexy talent agent who supports Diamond in his quest for the rock'n'roll footlights.  Unfortunately, motion pictures of this calibre are rare, and as such, the film remains the last great Hollywood musical. In the years since it's initial pressing, Natalie Cole's UNFORGIVEN has not only been acknowledged as one of the greatest pop albums ever made, it's also become an unforgettable flashpoint in the landscape of modern popular culture, a beacon to a tempest full of bitter naysayers who refuse to believe that love ultimately conquers all. First Supergirl picture is still the best, with superior special effects and stylish direction by the great Jeannot Szwarc.  A major influence on such later action hits as ""The Golden Child"" and the original ""Terminator."" In a rare performance as the heavy, funnyman Robin Williams disguises himself as an old Scottish bitty to throw fruit at James Bond.  Meandering ""high-concept"" picture goes on too long, but nonetheless thrilled 007 fans from Seattle to Shang-hai. First A-TEAM feature remains one of the best, offering a meaty storyline and the spot-on casting of Neeson as B.A. Baracus among its chief virtues.  This special Unrated Extended Cut means there's more A-TEAM to love than ever before, making it one of the ""go to"" favourites of super-adrenalized cinema.  This isn't any old team; these guys are bigger, bolder, and more bad ass than any of their competitors in the action arena -- they're the A-TEAM. Absorbing chronicle of a guy from out of town who learns he can fly.  Things get kinky when he develops a taste for tights.  The effects are dated, but the tights hold up, even today. This movie purports to tell the ""truth"" about cats and dogs, but I'm pretty sure there are still some things they're not telling us.  Amiable comedy earns high marks for its sly wit and adorable assortment of furry co-stars, plus Janeane Garofalo looks surprisingly hot in a thong bikini. Bloated, misguided attempt by George ""Moneybags"" Lucas to recapture the magic of his original STAR WARS trilogy.  Strictly for the crayon set, who likely will have nodded off before the end of the opening titles scroll.  The only thing the film has going for it is the delightful Jar Jar Binks, a character who sounds like Regis Philbin but looks like Seinfeld's Kramer. This film is a mess on dvd, with dirt and frequent artifacting marring the image. By no means a classic, but a film of this size and scope from the Eighties should look a heck of a lot better than this. Sturdy performances elevate director Hyams' lunar HIGH NOON. One of the series' best finds the ""Everyman handyman"" in love and on the run from a vicious band of jewel thieves.  It's great to see Ernest in such an exotic setting. I don't know what the previous reviewer was on when he critiqued this film, but it must have been powerful stuff!  CHARLIE CHAN & THE CURSE OF THE DRAGON QUEEN is remembered as the last truly great CHAN film, with Ustinov effortlessly effective in his commanding performance as the Asian Sherlock Holmes.  Who-done-it's just don't come any better, and if they did, well, that would be criminal! It's the future, and an evil genius named Magneto controls the fate of mankind.  The only ones standing in his way are the X-MEN, a superhuman group of wayward transexuals in black spandex catsuits who rail against the messengers of doom and injustice.  A rollercoaster ride from start to finish, X-MEN is the perfect panacea for a world ripe with bigotry and intolerance.  A must-see. Far and away the most disappointing cinematic experience I've had since Far And Away (1992).  How a film can promise so much and deliver so little is one for the Ages. Surprisingly warm and sentimental sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"" finds everyone's favourite serial killer setting up shop as the curator of a posh European art museum, while simultaneously falling in love with FBI agent Starling from the earlier film!  Nicely complemented by some of Celine Dion's prettiest songs, this bullseye sequel is sure to rekindle magical memories of first love.  Hopkins is compelling as the museum curator. It took nearly twenty years, but this winning sequel is a worthy successor to 1981's mythological masterpiece, CLASH OF THE TITANS.  If u own the first one, u gotta get this one, too. Second Elmo feature is pleasant enough, but should have been much better.  Many of the elements that made the earlier ST. ELMO'S FIRE such a kick are here, but unfortunately innovation and originality are not among them.  One or two songs stand out, but really folks, this is just a pale shadow of the mindblowing original.  The ertswhile star does contribute a commentary track, at least... Standard Clint Eastwood potboiler benefits from a strong supporting cast that includes TWIN PEAKS' Lara Flynn Boyle, the always reliable Tom Skerritt (POISON IVY, the original ALIEN), and villains Raul Julia and Sonia Braga.  Some good stunt sequences, but otherwise a routine cop programmer. Yet another excrutiatingly painful concert film from Macca, except this one's probably his MOST painful.  Solid performances by the band are constantly undermined by poor picture quality and prickly backstage cut-aways.  Just AWFUL. I'm afraid I must take exception with Ryan Piekenbrock's review of this sorry mess!  Far from Sherlock's best, CASE OF EVIL is closer to CONAN THE BARBARIAN than CONAN DOYLE.  Piekenbrock's review is rife with pithy and pretentious posturing in a sorry attempt to paint a Picasso with little more than good intentions and a pail of panda piss; the only mystery with CASE OF EVIL is why anyone would bother watching the thing... Frank Miller's legendary heroine explodes onto the screen with spectacular action and a surprising pathos.  Sexy Jennifer Garner impresses as the martial artist with a vengeful chip on her shoulder, and Terence Stamp proves once again that he's simply one of the finest character actors working today.  Forget FANTASTIC 4 -- ELEKTRA is the must-see comic book movie of the year! Arguably Jackson's best film, MISS CAST AWAY & THE ISLAND GIRLS is a high-octane action comedy that will thrill fans of all ages. A great gift idea for the young and young-at-heart, though die-hards may want to wait for the blu-ray to avoid double dipping.

The excitement never flags from the first episode to the last, so join Greene and his ""rag-tag, fugitive fleet"" for an adventure beyond all comprehension!!! No chain-saws, no hockey masks, just a good old-fashioned horror movie! Solid performances and beautifully atomospheric photography and soundtrack combine with make-up master Rick Baker's remarkable prosthetics to make this WOLFMAN an absolute treat for fans of the Universal monster classic! Fans of the classic tv show will have no complaints about this thrilling, action-packed update!  Fiennes and Thurman make Steed and Peel their own, while Sean Connery is at his scenery chewing best in a rare villainous turn.  Top notch production values and a witty, colourful script make this one irresistible to young and old alike. This review actually pertains to the movie HAMLET 2, which I've reviewed a number of times and for whatever reason the good people at Amazon.com continually refuse to publish.  And yes, HAMLET 2 is that rare sequel that actually improves upon the original. Ricky Gervais' outrageously funny satire of the human condition proved too bitter and cynical for mainstream audiences, but anyone who has ever found themselves on the outside looking in will find much to appreciate here. ""The Sermon of the Pizza Boxes"" is a comic gem!!! I was looking forward to revisiting this childhood favourite but the copy I received was covered in scratches and my doorstep has yet to see the promised replacement from Amazon.com.  If I receive a disc in good working order I will revise this review. One or two legitimate moments of suspense do not a thriller make, and anyway, the obtrusive and relentlessly cheery song and dance numbers make this play like a claustrophobic GUYS AND DOLLS. The major problem facing the producers of THIS IS IT is the dearth of any recent hits by Jackson, meaning the songs performed here are all very dated and fail to engage the audience in any meaningful manner. By now, the ""Step Up"" movies have transcended mere film lore to become a permanent fixture of the cultural landscape. Truly inspiring, STEP UP 4: MIAMI HEAT will rock your world, and the piping hot soundtrack will kick you in the front seat and kick you in the back seat for a good hour-and-a-half at least, and often at the same time!!! This 1990 all-star action blockbuster sparked a resurgence in the Captain America legend, returning the comic strip character to social prominence and launching a movie franchise that shows no signs of box-office fatigue. Stylishly directed by Albert Pyun, the film is a triumph of eye-popping visuals and unabashed patriotism, and Matt Sallinger's earnest and dynamic performance remains the definitive screen portrayal of the Marvel Comics icon. Beware full-frame video transfers! Audrey Hepburn is irresistible in this frothy adaptation of the Truman Capote novella. An immediate box-office smash, the film was followed up a scant three hours after its premiere by the sequel, LUNCH AT TIFFANY'S. Fans of the classic tv show will have no complaints about this thrilling, action-packed update!  Fiennes and Thurman make Steed and Peel their own, while Sean Connery is at his scenery chewing best in a rare villainous turn.  Top notch production values and a witty, colourful script make this one irresistible to young and old alike. In choosing to ignore this movie the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ignited a cultural firestorm leading to calls for more diversity among its Oscar hopefuls.  As such, FIFTY SHADES OF BLACK will be remembered as one of the most important and influential films of the 21st Century, deservedly so.  Soon to be available on blu-ray, this is a picture that not only entertains but also educates; it imparts a lesson to us all. The absolute low point (to date, that is), of the STAR TREK franchise, VOYAGER is nothing more than Gilligan's Island in space.  Unfortunately, they forgot to bring along Ginger and Mary-Ann... I loved the original, and this sequel doesn't disappoint. Indeed, it was Sandler's remarkable performance as Jill in the first film that caught the attention of the people behind the new ""Friends"" reboot, winning him the coveted role of Janis in the hotly anticipated re-up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A21GGD9JZ189H0, Great classic 80's kick butt action  movie one of  Patrick Swayze's best movies. and it looks great on Blu-ray great picture and great sound and the sound is in 5.1 surround sound. If you like Patrick Swayze and good old 80's action movies you may want to add this one to your Blu-ray library. Still a great movie after all these years. good set for the price. you get all 3 movies And with the first robocop movie you get some special features like the making of robocop with the first  movie. And with this new blu-ray set. The picture and sound has been cleaned up. on all 3 films. Awesome  looks great on Blu-ray  the picture looks  great and it sound great too. And with this Blu-ray you get 2 VERSIONS of the film  theatrical & extended cut. on one disc. I really liked this movie. You can really see the difference. This 4k transfer looks really great and the sound it great. If your starting a 4k blu-ray collection and you liked transformers  you might want to pick this up. To this day this movie is still a awsome classic. With this Blu-Ray you get 2 versions of the film  the theatrical and the extended  edition.  And it looks great and sounds great on blu-ray you get loads of special features. If you a terminator fan. And you like good old fashioned action  movie with practical special effects. and some CGI you may want to check this movie out for your self.  Great 90's classic movie Rented this directors cut of daredevil sucks. It is extremely slow moving  boring compared to the PG-13 version which I feel is much better and I had a much more detailed story line  Do yourself a favor skip this one and just see the PG-13 version of this movie.  The PG-13 version moves along much faster  and has better action sequences  then  this one. Brought these movies to replace my DVD'S copies for the price you can't go wrong. It's both movies on one Blu-ray disc. And yes both movies are in widescreen. the first one is the my favorite the second one is OK but for the price you can't go wrong. I like this movie and it looks great and sound great. In 4k it's a step up from the blu-ray. if you liked the fries transformers movie you might want to check this out for your self. Not as good as batman begins or the dark knight. But it is  nice to have to add to my 4k collection. the picture and sound have been cleaned up even more I do like these movies. But the blu-rays are crap  they did not remastered  or even clean up the sound.  Or picture my dvd copy that is 10 years old looks a hole lot better then these blu-rays want tell they really remastered these  before you buy. I rented this movie Not worth the time or money movie to dark during battle scenes just Like the other reviews had said. And slow  not enough action Skip this one. Worth a look this movie was good. but I felt like it was drawn out this movie was a lot longer the it needed to be. but at least I did not buy this movie I rented it. The movies sucked it was just a rip off The Lawnmower Man witch was done in (1992) except the lawnmower man was better. thank god I only rented this movie. it was still a waste of time. wish Hollywood would stop ripping off old movies. And the movie was slow moving too. stay away from this one. I rented this movie and it sucked I don't write reviews often but I feel this one had to be written this movie had some  good special-effects like the other reviews said but it just moved slow in spots. The movie twister moved along much better and made more sense. Hollywood needs to stop recycling there movies. You see the best stuff in the movie trailer. Great action movie good gun fight scenes good storyline.  And it looks and sounds great on Blu-ray anyone interested in action films should at least check this one out I can't wait for the sequel bottom line of this  movie you don't mess with John wick.  If you're going to see the sequel see this one first. I rented this movie. It was so boring I kept losing interest couldn't wait For it to be over. It is a extremely slow moving movie. If I can give it zero stars I would. They show the best scenes in the preview not worth the time or money. I do like the blade movies but the Blu-ray transfer looks like crap on this Blu-ray set. And on Blade Trinity you get the unrated version with I did not care for I found it slow moving compared to the theatrical version. With is more fast passed. And you do not get the  theatrical version of Blade Trinity on this Blu-ray set.  I liked the theatrical version of Blade Trinity  better then the unrated one. This movie is worth the upgrade to Blu-ray. The picture and sound have both been remastered in HD.  And this movie definitely definitely looks better on Blu-ray sounds better on Blu-ray then it did with my old DVD copy. On this Blu-ray  you get both versions of this show censored and uncensored  Love it watching this I laughed so hard I was crying. I think with each Blu-ray release Jeff Dunham gets better and better with his act. the uncensored  is hilarious. if you like Jeff Dunham you may want to check out this Blu-ray. And it looks great and sound great on Blu-ray. I rented this movie and it's not a good. The movie I felt was slow moving too dark in some scenes to see what was going on in the movie . and for me it was a boring movie. and the ending sucked. Save you money. This is a very good movie. From start to finish. had some great one liners in it. And at least for me it had a good pace to it. I am glad I added this movie to my Blu-ray collection. Rented this movie and boy did it suck very slow moving. And boring. In the previews it look  like a ok movie but it was just a dumb movie. Hollywood is getting worse at making movies. I rented this one all I can say is skip this one. the first 15 min. was all right. but the rest of the was really really slow moving.  If you want to see this movie wait for it to come to cable TV. This was not a good movie. For me I felt this movie was slow moving And not as good as the  avengers movies. You may want to skip this one. Save your money. This is an excellent 4K Blu-ray. You get both versions of the foam on the  4K desk. Picture and sound in 4K is excellent if you have a 4K player and a 4K TV or projector you may want to upgrade to the 4K and a receiver that can handle 4K you may want to upgrade. This movie was terrible. The acting was horrible the special effects are OK but the storyline just doesn't fit it's been too many years since the first Independence Day don't waste your time on this.  The first one was much much much better than this crap don't waste your time or money.  Wasn't even worth the money I paid to rent it. BOTTEM LINE IT'S A BORNG MOVIE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AFDAOEYSGRUAQ," Everybody enjoys a ""feel good"" movie and this one definitely fills the bill in that category! Entertaining, funny, moving & very good acting by the entire cast. Hector Elizondo is a class-act and we just don't see enough of him ('Last Man Standing') !! Watch it & you'll be glad you did. Yes.....men, too, will enjoy this flick ! Bon appetite !! Good flick ! Very good acting all around the cast ! Don't let the western country locale  give you a sense of calm ! This film is loaded with action & not intended for the squeamish ! Hold on & enjoy the ride !! Good flick ! Very good acting all around the cast ! Don't let the western country locale  give you a sense of calm ! This film is loaded with action & not intended for the squeamish ! Hold on & enjoy the ride !! Bateman is typically good with comedic roles.....but this movie could not be saved regardless of his normal success with this type of silly humor ! The other actors missed the mark altogether.....& Anniston's role/character was overdone & dripping wetwith ""crude"" !! Save your money on this dud ! Decent flick but get your dictionary ready if you're into understanding certain financial terms you likely are not familiar with unless a student of the financial world. Spacey is such a good actor & he doesn't disappoint in this film one iota. Provides certain insight into the world of mega-finances! The movie does not star Matt Damon (Jason Bourne) but it does reflect on him and provides some necessary clarification in several areas. My wife & I both enjoyed the movie as it was well written and directed with very good performances by both Jeremy Renner(as Aaron Cross) and Rachel Weisz. Very entertaining overall, filled with action from start to finish and definitely recommended! We're hoping for more of the same in the future out of Hollywood! Enjoy! Ben Affleck did a superb job with this suspenseful tale of the CIA's dealing with U.S. Embassy employees trying to escape from Iran during the 1979-1980 Iran hostage crises. It will keep you intrigued throughout right to the suspenseful conclusion !! Make it a ""MUST SEE"" !!

This movie lives up to Ryan's reputation and won't disappoint. Enjoy! Just an all-round ""feel good"" movie !! Really enjoyed it but be sure to watch the original version first ('The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) for a truer appreciation and understanding of the sequel. Enjoy !

A2DJYERRIH5C8T," This is a good action movie.  Terrorists highjack the Presidents plane with the President still on it.  He is a former marine and fights back.  HarrisonFord iis excellent as always.  Gary Oldman as the head villain is as well.  If you like action movies you will like this. This is a different type movie.  On purpose.  It is Arnold Schwarzennegger mocking himself as an action hero.  I actually think this is one of his best movies.  It has plenty of action, humor cameos a little bit of everything.  And it's entertaining and a good way to kill two hours. This came out I think around the time time as Top Gun.  And was overshadowed by it.  You just have to watch the movie.  It's good on it's ow.  You just have to tell yourself it's just a movie.  Because most of the plot is unbelievable,  The acting by Lou Gossett Jr. is good.  And I just watched Executive Decision yesterday.  And David Suchet is a good as a terrorist. I love this movie.  It's about a hi-tech helicopter that the L.A. police department is going to us for the 1984 Olympics against terrorism.  It stars Roy Scheider who I always thought was under rated.  Check out his filmography.  He was in several Best Picture nominations.  And I think this was Warren Oates last movie.  It is well acted and has a ton of action. This is a pretty good movie.  Woody Harrelson and Kiefer Sutherland play two rodeo cowboys who go to New York City to help  a friend find his missing daughter.  It's sort of a buddy McCloud movie.  Woody Harrelson has the best scenes which include ordering a steak at a five star restaurant.  Then ordering a popsycle for dessert.  There is plenty of laughs and action to go around in this. Sylvester Stallone will never get past his two iconic roles of Rocky and Rambo.  No matter what else he does.  This might be his best movie since the original Rocky.  There is an explosion in a tunnel beneath the Hudson river and he tires to rescue the victems out of the tunnel.  There is plenty of action, and suspense in this one.  A disaster/action move.  That could have been made in the '70s when disaster movies were the rage. Everybody knows John Wayne won an Oscar for playing Rooster Cogburn in True Grit.  Six years later he Played him again in this.  He and Katherine Hepburn as a Preachers daughter to find the men who killer her Father,  It's a pretty good story.  And they make a good team. I saw this at the theater with my parents.  It brings back good memories.  I don't know anybody who hasn't seen this.  And everytime I watch it.  It brings back the same emotions.  Anyone who has ever owned a pet has gone through what happens at the end.  This is one of the all time classic movies. Schwarzenegger had taken some time off when this came out.  This is just as action packed as anything he had done before.  Although maybe he was getting older because it seemed like his character was getting hurt more.  This is a good action movie with explosions and gunfights.  And people faking their deaths.  And James Caan is a very good villain. Paul Newman had one of the most successful careers ever.  Multiple Oscar nominations.  One win plus an honorary one.  Signature roles like Butch Cassidy and The Sting.  And this.  He plays a prisoner on a chain gang.  A rebel who won't break.  He brings the right amount of coolness and swagger to the role.  And for me when I think about a Paul Newman role this is what I think of. This is an excellent family movie.  Although there are a couple of scenes one with horses and one with dogs that my not be right for younger kids.  But the rest of the movie is terrific.  It basically is about two bear hunters.  A grown bear that they are hunting and an orphan bear cub.  It is the kind of movie that you can watch and then turn around and watch again. This is a very good action movie.  This is tied with The Score as my favorite Robert DeNiro movie.  There is a lot of good action.  Including gun fights in the street.  And an even better car chase then Bullitt.  An excellent movie that is just as good no matter how many times you've seen it. I think this is the best comedic western I have seen since Cat Ballou.  Tom Berenger plays a a 1920sh era big screen cowboy.  Who is naive but also smart and witty.  He stays one step ahead of everybody because the same things always happen in all of his movies. That sums this movie up.  You have to watch it yourself to really get it. John Wayne played against type in this.  Not playing in a western or a military movie.  He does rather well as a big game hunter who goes to Africa to catch animals for zoos and circuses.  Red Buttons steals the scenes he is in.  And a baby elephant steals the whole movie. This is a pretty good movie on it's own.  The biggest problem is.  It is the sequel to Romancing The Stone and it just cant top it.  Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner are great together.  The character Joan Wilder is more famous then the character Jack Colter who is known as Mr. Joan Wilder..  This movie has a lot of action and romance like Romancing The Stone did too. This is my favorite Arnold movie.  It is pretty none stop action.  Killing and explosions.  And a lot great lines.  This Is My Weak Arm.  Remember When I Promised To Kill You Last.  Let Off Some Steam.  My Friend Is Dead Tired.  . Chevy Chase comes back as Fletch this time to a plantation in Louisiana.  This movie is pretty good.  It has a lot to live up too.  If they had made this one first and then not made a second one it would have worked better.  It's just not quite as good as the original. Patrick Swayze basically plays a hillbilly cop who's brother gets killed by mobsters in Chicago.  So he comes to Chicago to investigate.  It is a pretty good action movie.  That also has a young Ben Stiller and Liam Neeson.  And features a mean bow and arrow. This movie is alright.  I saw it at the theater when I was 13.  Robert Blake plays a motorcycle police officer investigating a murder.  He is the established law man.  Who identifies more with the anti establishment.  This ranks as one of Blake's  best performances along with In Cold Blood.  But the ending is a real bummer. The thing about this movie is it is okay on it's  own.  I haven't heard anybody else say.  But it reminds me of The Dirty Dozen.  It isn't too realistic.  None of the cast especially Donald Sutherland look like they are in the Army.  Te story is Some G.I.s are stealing Nazi gold bars.  It's okay.  And Don Rickles in a none comedic role did well. For awhile Stallone tried doing some comedy's.  And I don't think any of them were hits.  This is my favorite.  And it's pretty good.  A comedy about gangster's would be kind of hard to make anyway.  Stallone does pretty good and so does Marisa Tomei  who has an accent that will drive you crazy. This is my favorite Robin Hood movie.  I have not seen a lot of the early ones though.  But for me it would be hard to top this.  Kevin Costner is excellent as is the rest of the cast.  And it's fun to see Alan Rickman get it in the end. This is a pretty good movie.  Based on true events.  The Americans, Canadians and English form a special unit in WWII.  They are mostly misfits who don't get along with each other.  William Holden and Cliff Robertson are both excellent.  I always thought Cliff Robertson despite being an Oscar winner was very under rated.  And there are some pretty intense battle scenes. I like Robert Redford.  He always adds a little class to everything he does.  And he is the best thing about this movie.  It has a good story about not giving up on your dreams.  But there is just something about this to me that it just doesn't quite work.  They tried to make it too larger then life. This is a pretty good movie. Eddie Murphy plays a con man who runs for Congress when a Congressman who has the same name has him dies in office.  He uses the name to basically win the election.  Although he only runs for the money.  Being a con man he fits right in in Washington. I didn't know that much about the character of Elvira.  She shows up every year at Halloween in beer commercials.  But wearing that wig and that dress how can you not love her.  In this she flaunts what she has.  Makes some really bad jokes.  And everybody either thinks she's really funny or really offensive.  I was surprised how really hot and sexy in a stripper sort of way she is.  This movie is certainly not for kids. This is a good family movie with Christina Ricci.  I never did watch the Casper cartoons much.  It seems like there was always something else on on Saturday's at the same time.  But I liked it when I did watch it.  The movie has a lot of cameos in with Clint Eastwood among others. This is a hard movie to review.  It's something you have to see for yourself.  It involves a transvestite and a serial killer among other things who are mixed up with each other on Christmas Eve,  Steve Martin gets top billing but the cast also includes Adam Sandler and Madeline Kahn.  It's funny and a movie that you can watch anytime of year. This is a good family movie.  I was never an Elizabeth Taylor fan.  She was about 12 years old when she made this.  And she does very good as a girl who trains a horse to run in the Grand National.  Mickey Rooney as her trainer does well also.  And it was kind of fun to also see a very young Angela Lansbury too. .I've always liked mountain men movies.  There is something about giving up everything and living in the mountains.  But this movie isn't as good as say Jeremiah Johnson or the very under rated Sacred Ground.  It is o.k.  An the acting is good.  It just seems to me it is not very involving. Don Knotts does pretty good in this.  His nuerotic nervousness works well as a dentist who goes West to open up a practice.  He gets married to a woman who is really an outlaw and they get into one mess after another.  With her and her guns usually getting them out of it.  This is a movie that's not bad.  But something you don't want to see everyday. This is a pretty good movie.  I think it was the movie Keanu Reeves made after Speed and he was beginning to become a high profile story.  The story and the acting by everyone in this is good. This is a pretty good movie.  It is always fun to watch Eddie Murphy when he plays multiple roles.  And the scene at the dinner table is worth watching the movie for.  I was never a big fan of Jerry Lewis.  And I like this movie better then the original. This is a pretty good Disney movie.  A good family movie that kids always like watching. Rick Moranis plays an inventor who invents a machine that shrinks things,  His kids and some neighbor kids shrink themselves and then have to travel across the yard.  Trying to avoid bees and ants and lawnmowers. I don't think this is one of John Wayne's best movies.  He hires 11 school boys to go on a cattle drive with him.  They learn the harsh reality of life.  And come back as seasoned cowboys.  Bruce Dern as the head baddie gets the most out of his role.  Nobody made westerns quite like John Wayne.  Again I don't think mthis is one of his best.  Buut it wouldn't have been the same without him. Hard To Kill is my favorite Steven Seagal movie. And then this is next.  He plays an EPA agent who is sent to Kentucky to investigate some toxic waste from abandoned mines being dumped into the water.  It has a bunch of country music stars like Randy Travis,Kris Kristofferson and Mark Collie.  Marg Helgenberger and Stephen Lang are good also. This is a very good family movie.  Bridgette Anderson is feeling unloved and runs away.  She hides out in a car that two criminals have stolen.  And the next thing you know they start caring and looking out for her.  I did not know until a few years ago that Bridgette Andersen died of an over dose.  She should have grown up and been a big name star.  But instead turned out to be a True Hollyood story. This is a pretty good action movie.  Mixed in with a little Sci/Fi.  Bruce Willis Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler all give great performances.  Billy bob Thorton and Steve Buscemi and Will Patton do to in supporting roles.  They play roguhnecks who are sent into space to blow up an meteor headed for Earth.  It is pretty much none stop action and is fun to watch on a big screen t.v. This is a good movie.  It's an updated modern day version of A Christmas Carol.  I think this is one of Bill Murray's best roles.  Along with What About Bob.  And Carol Kane is excellent.  If you didn't know.  The scene where they are standing outside the door.  Watching them play Trivial Pursuit.  The dog barking is Buck from Married With Children. This movie has a few things going for it.  Halle Berry and Sharon Stone.  But the problem is you mention Catwoman and you think of Batman.  This is totally different.  It is her own character.  And I don't know what the problem really is.  But the movie doesn't work. A giant crocodile is living in a lake in New York  It is eating people and animals.  This movie is done in an over the top kind of way  It's a good movie and it works. I cant think of anything that would be scarier then to be attacked by a crocodile.  And Betty White is great. This is a good true story.  Cuba Gooding Jr.  plays the charector of the black to become a Navy diver.  He over comes all kinds of racism and other obstacles.  Robert DeNiro and Hal Holbrook are nearly as good.  As  two of the officers who are doing everything they can to keep him from succeeding.  And Charlize Theron in a small role as DeNiro's wife is beautiful.  This is a good inspiring movie. I guess it's only natural to start comparing movies when thy go on and make multiple sequels.  Everyone seems to think that this is the worst of the Jurassic Park movies.  I don't think it's that bad.  And really don't think it's that much different then the first two.  And there is a totally unique scene of having to dig through dinosaur poop to find a phone. This is my favorite George Clooney movie.  He and other fellow inmates are still chained together as they escape prison.  Then they have one adventure after another.  Which includes running along for a while with another criminal who likes to shoot cows,  And getting banned from Woolworth's.  And it also has a great soundtrack. This is a good Disney movie.  Anne Hathaway is amazing as an awkward teen age girl who finds out she is heir to the throne of a European Country.  And as she transforms into a Princess.  I think that this was her first movie.  And you get the feeling that she was going to be a big star.  This is a good movie that the whole family will probably like. Mostly I bought this because of Angelina Jolie.  She was probably at the peak of her popularity when this came out.  And she looks great in that costume.  The movie did big box office.  It is a good action adventure.  Based on a video game.  The movie works well on it's own  With a lot of action and good special effects. Mel Gibson plays a priest who has lost his faith after his wife dies in a car wreck.  He wakes up one morning  to a crop circle on his farm.  Then after hearing similar things are going on all over the world the world realizes it is being invaded by aliens.  The movie is very suspensfull.  Although to me it becomes anti climatic.  It's a good movie to watch once. This is the second Charlie's Angels movie.  It has Bernie Mac instead of Bill Murray.  Bernie Mac is too uptight.  And it has Demi Moore and Cameron Diaz trying to out do each other.  It has some skits like singing and dancing that come off like MTV videos.  It is a continuation of the first movie.  And is good on it's own.  But I didn't think either one was as good as the t.v. show. The story of this is that a terrorist is threatening to blow up the world.  A group of superheroes band together to try to stop him.  The leader is Allan Quartermain along with The Invisible Man and Dr. Jeckyll among others.  The movie is ambitious with good performances.  It's better then I thought it would be. Reese Witherspoon is as good in this.  As she was in the first one.  The movie over all isn't as good.  But it is still good on it's own.  It doesn't seem as fresh or whatever as the first one. This is a pretty good disaster movie.  About climate change and the effects it has.  You watch basically America try to avoid going through another ice age.  The acting and the special effects are good. Spiderman 3 is okay.  This time he is kind of having a hard time with his own image.  The acting is good.  And the story is okay.  And I think that these first three spiderman movies were the best ones.  But it was time to not make any more of them. This is a good family movie.  It is basically about a scientist who discovers a cure for dog allergies.  So the cast want to try and reverse it.  The dogs and cats can talk and build machines and do anything pretty much that people can do.  And that is pretty much the plot. This is a hard movie to review.  It's something you have to see for yourself.  It involves a transvestite and a serial killer among other things who are mixed up with each other on Christmas Eve,  Steve Martin gets top billing but the cast also includes Adam Sandler and Madeline Kahn.  It's funny and a movie that you can watch anytime of year. Bandits is a really good movie.  Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thorton and Cate Blanchett work well together.  Especially Billy Bob who plays a hypochondriac.  And in one especially inspire scene thinks he has a brain tumor.  There is action, romance suspense and comedy in this.  And you are  rooting for them.  And thhis is easily the type of movie that you don't have to wait too long to watch again. I was still young enough to remember on Saturday mornings when I would sit watching cartoons all morning.  But I never did watch this.  But this is a pretty good movie.  And it works.  It's great for kids.  Although there is a little bit too much humor about breaking wind.  And it's pretty good for adults too.  Who doesn't love Sarah Michelle Gellar and the rest of the cast pulls this off very well. The second Austin Powers movie should have been the last one.  It was running out of steam.  This is even worse.  It's good enough to watch more then once.  But that's about it.  Mike Myers to me made a movie career out of three characters.  Wayne, Austin Powers and Shrek.  Do you wonder why you don't see him much anymore. This movie reminded me a lot of Armageddon.  Except that I thought this was better.  The Earth has stopped rotating and scientists have got to get it going again so they go to the core to set off a nuclear explosion.  The movie is tense.  The special effects are pretty good.  This is the kind of movie that you can watch every once in awhile. Quentin Tarantino has s wn stule of directing.  Which like no one else.  This is sort of a modern day spaghetti none western.  It is violent and has dark humor.  And the charactors don't have names.  You have to see to see vo1 and vol 2 for this to work. Eddie Murphy made this after a string of movies that flopped.  It's a Disney movie.  He plays a real estate agent living in a haunted house.  The special effects are good. The movie is less then an hour and a half long.  But it is one of his better movies. Robert Downey Jr. makes a good Sherlock Holmes and Jude Law who always seems to bring most of the movies he's in down a notch.  Make a good team.  I's a good story a good mystery that all comes together at the end.  And Rachel McAdams is always good. I think this is a better movie then the John Wayne one.  Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett is the star.  And as Charlie Daniels would say a pretty mean fiddle player. His death scene I thought was a  little over the top. But Dennis Quaid as Sam  Houston is also excellent.  It shows how much trouble he had holding his men together.  And he gives a rather fired up speech before the battle of San Jacinto. This is a pretty good movie.  About a group of fire fighters in Baltimore  Dealing with fires.  How they work together and depend on each other and deal with their personal lives also.  I thought John Travolta should have got top billing. This is a good movie.  It may not be a classic.  And it isn't the first movie you think of at Christmas.  But it is a good and funny Christmas movie. I bought the Precious Memories cd for my Mom.  She liked it And then when this dvd came out I bought it too.  Its good.  I grew up in  a Baptist Church and was saved in 1997  I knew most of these songs.  He does them in a very easy going laid back kind of Don Williams style. This is a very good family movie.  Bridgette Anderson is feeling unloved and runs away.  She hides out in a car that two criminals have stolen.  And the next thing you know they start caring and looking out for her.  I did not know until a few years ago that Bridgette Andersen died of an over dose.  She should have grown up and been a big name star.  But instead turned out to be a True Hollyood story. Mostly I bought this because of Angelina Jolie.  She was probably at the peak of her popularity when this came out.  And she looks great in that costume.  The movie did big box office.  It is a good action adventure.  Based on a video game.  The movie works well on it's own  With a lot of action and good special effects. Rocky is now over 60 years old.  And looks it.  But accepts a fight against the reigning  heavy weight champ.  There are a lot of flash backs to the other movies.  And some of the characters from the earlier movies show up in this.  It is time for Rocky to retire. This movie has everything.  Action adventure romance comedy.  I thought it was going to be a horror movie.  But it is more of an Indiana Jones type movie.  Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz and the rest of the cast is excellent. This movie has everything.  Action adventure romance comedy.  I thought it was going to be a horror movie.  But it is more of an Indiana Jones type movie.  Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz and the rest of the cast is excellent. This movie has everything.  Action adventure romance comedy.  I thought it was going to be a horror movie.  But it is more of an Indiana Jones type movie.  Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz and the rest of the cast is excellent. Red stands for retired extremely dangerous.  Bruce Willis Morgan Freeman and John Malkovich play retired CIA agents who are drawn back into action.  But Helen Mirron steals the movie for me when she comes off as probably the baddest one of any of them.  And Mary Louse Parker is very good also.  I always liked her.  And I don't think she is in enough movies.  This is a good action/comedy movie. This is a good movie.  It is based on a true story.  It has good performances.  It is tense and exciting and violent.  It reminds me as sort of a cross between Heat with Al Pacino and The Bank Job. This is the best of the three Dark Knight movies.  Tom Hardy as the villain Bane I think is the most menacing villain Batman has gone up against in any of the movies.  The movie itself has a lot of action.  But it is still too long.  And there are some terribly slow parts in it.  Anne Hathaway as Cat Woman is also excellent.  She makes more then just the Dark Knight rise. This is a pretty good movie.  Ed O'Neill plays a father picking up his son from military school for the holidays.  Ed O'Neill plays an adult who is more of a kid then his hon.  And his son.  And his son played by Ethan Randall is a spoiled brat who doesn't want to go home.  And who knows martial arts so his dad cant rally do anything about it.  It's a fun movie to watch. The original Die Hard is one of my favorite movies.  And probably my favorite movie  from the eighties.  But they keep making these.  And it is running out of steam.  This time it's John McClane and his son batteling Russian terrorists.  The first movie was realistic.  And these now are getting impossible.  I will always love the first movie.  But it is time to give it a rest. This is an excellent movie.  Four big name magicians get together putting on shows.  Which include taking money from banks.  And from bank accounts.  And putting it into audience members accounts.  Is it real or not. Who knows what and who doesn't. The whole movie is filled with twists and surprises.  And an ending that I didn't see coming. This is a series that the whole series needs to be put on dvd.  This is a six dvd set with the entire season two.  With highlights like Robbery:48 hours and Captain Hook.  Although each episode is good. The third Naked Gun is still just as good.  With people like Anna Nicole Smith and Pia Zadora.  People who you don't really think about being in comedies.  Listen to the names of the list of best pictures at the Academy Awards in this.  And If you didn't know what kind of movie this was already.  You will then. This is a pretty good concert dvd.  I think this was originally on hbo.  It features some of his classic songs like Sweet Caroline and I Am...I Said.  And one of my favorites the country Forever In Bluejeans.  Although he doesn't do the whole song.  That is pretty much the only complaint I have. To me nobody else could do the kind of comedy Rodney Dangerfield could do.  This role is perfect for him.  He plays a Jerry Springer type talk show host.  There is one particular funny scene involving a drunk horse.  But the whole movie is one funny situation after another.  this is my favorite Dangerfield moovie. This is a true story of a New York City Police Officer who won't take bribes.  When he goes to his superiors they even encourage him to.  As you get more into the story he becomes more of an outcast.  As he lives a hippie lifestyle and seems like the only honest cop on the police force.  This movie is slow at times.  But it always makes you feel what he is going through. This is better then part two.  But it doesn't come close to the original.  There is one good thing.  Thomas Ian Griffith brigs the perfect amount of sleaze in his role of a trainer taking who is just setting Daniel up.  And one really dumb thing.  Martin Kove seeming coming back from the dead as part of that set up. The movie all in all is good.  But it doesn't work like the first one. This is a pretty good movie.  Weird Al takes over a UHF t.v. station and through experiments and good luck turns it into the city's number one station.  He parady's everything from Rambo and Indiana Jones.  It's just a good movie.  It helps if you have the right kind of sense of humor.  Which I have always had. This is a pretty good football movie.  Scott Bakula plays a 39 something college quarterback.  It is a typical sports movie  A group of underdogs fighting to earn respect.  Kathy Ireland does pretty good as a female kicker on the team.  The performances are good all around.  This is a pretty good feel good movie. Chevy Chase does well  in this.  He becomes invisible through a botched government experiment.  Then has to go on the run when the government tries to cover it up.  The special effects are very good.  Its a big improvement from the fifties.  Daryl Hannah and the rest of the cast do well also. For me this movie was more about who was in it then anything else.  Anything with Christina Applegate is worth watching.  And she's been in some things like Kiss Of Fire that if she hadn't been in I wouldn't have watched at all.  And this was made in 1988 at the height of her and also  Alyssa Milano's 80s ishness.  What else do you you need. This is alright.  I watch a lot more movies then I read books.  And from what I have heard most Joseph Wambaugh books don make as good of movies.  The acting in this is good with George C. Scott as the veteran cop and James Keach as the young one.  But the movie seems to be a story about what a bummer it is to be a cop. This is more of a traditional western then The Cheyenne Social Club.  James Stewart plays a peaceful farmer who is also Sheriff with a home made badge his kids made him.  Henry Fonda plays the leader of a gang that rides into town and starts bullying everybody.  When Stewart finally decides to take a stand.  It is kind of slow.  The final showdown is pretty good.  But it takes a long time to get to. This is a pretty good movie on its ' own.  But it isn't as good as the first Major League.  Most of the cast from the first one is in this.  Except Rene Russo and Wesley  Snipes who was a bigger star this time around then he was in the first one.  They brought in some new faces  fo this one like Omar Epps and David Keith who do well. John Candy plays a middle age policeman who never got married.  And Maureen O'Hara who hadn't made a movie since  I think 1971,  Plays his over bearing over protective Mother.  He meets Ally Sheedy who is also single and has here won hangups.  Basically they fall in love but cant escape the shadow of his Mother.  It is a very good romantic comedy. This is a good romantic comedy.  Michael Keaton and Geena Davis are good opposite each other.  As speech writers for politicians who are running against each other.  Every one is good in this.  And it is a good comedy also. This movie is o.k.  It's a spoof mostly of the Lethal Weapon movies.  With a lot of other stuff thrown in too.  My favorite scene is probably when Estevez and Kathy Ireland are comparing all their scars.  And William Shatner is always good at making fun of himself. This is a pretty good action movie.  I think it is better then the original Under Seige.  It's on a train this time.  There is plenty of action.  And good villains.  And you get a pretty good idea about the way things are going to end.  But it still is suspensful.  This and Hard To Kill I think are the best two movies Steven Seagal ever did. This came out in 1930.  It shows how much comedy has changed.  As well as everything else over the years.  This dvd was given to me by a friend.  It;s alright.  There is one scene of them changing a tire that is pretty funny.  If you like Laurel and Hardy and the Three Stooges this is kind of the same type humor. James Stewart always brought a laid back style to his movies.  This is a good western that may not be as well known as some of his other movies.  He and Walter Brennan  play partners trying to sell a herd of cattle during the Alaskan gold rush.  Stewart is tougher in this then he is a lot of times.  And the acting buy him and the rest of the cast is good. The best thing about this movie is Joan Severance.  She plays a crime fighter.  Sort of a female Batman.  She wears a costume that shows a lot of skin.  And she has got a great car.  What else does she need. This tries to pick up 15 years after The Munster's went off t.v.  Even with the three original leads it doesn't work.  You have to be a fan.  The movie isn't bad.  Again it just doesn;t work. Mel Gibson plays a wealthy executive who's son gets kidnapped.  Rather then pay a ransom he goes on t.v. with the money spread out in front of him and puts a bounty on the head of the kidnappers.  Very intense stuff.  The police and everybody involved including his wife thinks he did the wrong thing.  And there is also a very good performance by Gary Sinise. Dennis Quaid and Kathleen Turner are both excellent as a husband and wife spy team.  And Stanley Tucci as a villain right out of th Apple Dumpling Gang is great.  The movie has a lot of comedy and some action and some twists and turns.  The movie to me isn't one of those that is as good as the first time you see it.  But it is good enough to watch more then one anyway.  And it's always fun. Willie Nelson is pretty good in this.  He plays a Preacher who's wife leaves him for another man.  He then goes on a rampage killing everybody.  Then after trying to settle down.  Roayl Dano and his sons won't leave him alone .  So there is more killing.  Amazon shows that they have this dvd for 190 dollars.  I have never seen it on dvd.  It needs to be released for a decent price. This is a pretty good movie.  The kind of movie Eddie Murphy does best an action/comedy.  It is very under rated.  He plays a hostage negotiator.  And Michael Rapaport who is also very under rated is very good in this.  It is set in San Francisco.  Which also is where Bullitt was set.  Has a great car chase in it like Bullitt.  This is a movie that is just as good no matter how many times you watch it. These are good t.v. movies.  I used to watch this series every week.  Darren McGavin played a news reporter who was always uncovering some mystery.  And the police were always contradicting him.  These are two seperate movies.  One about a vampire and one kind of a Jeckyll and Hyde type story.  The series  was only on for two years.  Bu it is available on dvd. This is a pretty good movie.  I think one ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
f the best movies of James Garner's career.  Especially later in his career.  He uses a tank to get his son out of jail after trumped up drug charges and already having made enemies with the local sheriff.  It's just an overall good movie. I thought this was a step down from the first two Major League movies.  Especially the first one.  Most of the cast was gone from this one.  Although there were still a few of them around.  But the freshness was wearing off and this one just wasn't the same.  It is till okay on it's own. I wanted to see this when it came out.  I remember it pretty much tanked when it came out.  Lloyd Bridges looks tired and looks like he has better things to do.  The one thing it has going for it is Christina Applegate.  Who has been in her share of flops.  But still always looks great.  She plays the President of the United States which is probably all you need to know about this. This is a pretty good murder/mystery action movie.  A good cast with Mark Harmon and Sean Connery who's characters don't really get along.  And Mark Harmon dating Meg Ryan who is Sean Connery's daughter doesn't help.  I think this is one of the better movies by everyone who is in it. If you see who is in this movie before you watch it/  Christina Applegate is featured on the cover of the dvd.  But has a real small role.  She was the reason I wanted to watch this.  Other then that it's not bad.  But it's one of those thar once I saw it.  I don't really want to watch it again. I had never heard of this movie.  The cover shows Christina Applegate in pink lace pole dancing.  Which happens in about the first 30 seconds of the movie. The rest of the movie long slow drawn out and boring.  Wichita Falls Texas is mentioned in the move.  And that's about it. What is it about this movie.  The original Godzilla.  I first saw on t.v.  I don't know how old I was.  And I don't know how many times over the years I have seen this.  Mostly what you have is somebody in a lizard suit going around stomping on models.  Exciting stuff for kids in it's day.  But even watching it now.  Knowing how cheesy it is.  It is still fun to watch. This is a not bad movie.  Steve McQueen was a star but not the superstar he would become later.  And Jackie Gleason does well as someone McQueen idolizes.  And they make a surprisingly good team.  Tuesday Weld  plays a young girl who mostly gets what she wants and her and Gleason are kind of an odd couple.  She refers to him as her fat Randolph Scott.  It's a comedy/drama with a depressing ending. Except for the fact that when this movie came out it was so hyped up because it had Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts Both in it.  I have never really been a fan of either one of them.  Although I think Julia Roberts is alright when she is not the main star like in Valentines Day.  As far as the movie.  I think it is o.k as an action comedy romance movie.  But nothing really stands out about it. This isn't as good as the first Scary Movie.  This time it's a parody of movies like House On Haunted Hill.  Anna Faris is back and she is good in this kind of stuff.  And even for a comedy Chris Elliott is pretty creepy.  And the cast looks like they are having fun. This is a movie about about taping a country music t.v. show.  Thhe highlight is Johnny Cash with the Carter Family singing Were You There.  This was clearly in his pill popping days.  He looks like death warmed over.  This is worth watching if you like country music. This is a parody of horror movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream.  It is probably pretty offensive.  It ha a lot of sexual and drug humor.  And Carmen Electra running through sprinklers in her under wear and Shannon Elizabeth too. I was a teenager when this was on during the '70s  And I used to watch this every week.  This  season also has the pilot movie that explains what happened to him and he got his bionics.  It's pretty good.  This is the only season I bought of the dvd.  I enjoyed watching it once.  But it is not something I wuld really care about watching over again. This is the type of movie.  I have to be in the right kind of mood to watch.  It is funny and raunchy.  The dog steals the movie.  And I have never looked at pastry quite the same. This is one of those movies that's a parody of a lot of the teen movies.  There are some funny parts.  And there are some parts that don't work.  It's okay to watch every once in awhile. This is a pretty good sequel.  Maybe just as good as the firs Spiderman.  Tobey MacGuire and Kirsten Dunst both came back and are just as good.  Most of the cast from the first movie like Cliff Robertson came back for this one.  And Doc Ock as the villain is better in this. I bought this for the Davy Crockett movie.  Which is still one of the best ;live action Disney movies.  The extra's in this like the t.v. show are alright.  But it just so happens that they came with the movie.  I wouldn't have gotten them otherwise. While in Las Vegas for an Elvis Impersonator convention.  A gang of thieves rob a casino dressed like Elvis impersonators.  Then try and get a way.  The movie is pretty violent.  And Kevin Costner is someone to not mess around with.  Kurt Russell does look a lot like Elvis.  This is  a good movie that is worth watching every once in awhile. Randy Travis was a big deal in the beginning of his career for being more  traditional.  I thought he was okay.  With an occasional great song like Forever And Ever Amen.  Which is included here.  But to be honest I am more of a fan of the  pop/country artists like Shania.  This is a good live concert dvd with songs like On The Other Hand,Deeper Than The Holler and Diggin' Up Bones. It seemed to me that before this.  Liv Tyler always played the wide eyed naive innocent girl.  Like In That Thing You Do.  Her sexy side busted out in this one.  As she played a girl that everybody wanted to be with.  This is a very funny movie.  It has action, comedy.  A little bit of everything.  And the moral is the girl that you want is not always the girl that you want. This is a pretty good concert.  It features hits like Queen Of Hearts and The Sweetest Thing.  And some new songs at the time.  I didn't realize at the time.  Ori  just didn't catch that this was done live the night before the  terrorist attacks of 9/11.  So everything changed the very next day.  The highlight to me is the closing song It's Late.  Her band is good.  It is a tight well done energetic concert. Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro play two cops who are chosen to be on a Cops like reality show.  DeNiro is the serious no nonsense cop who just wants to do his job and thinks all the cameras get in the way.  And Eddie Murphy is the ham who loves the attention.  They both play their roles well.  And it doesn't seem like they are acting.  This is a pretty good cop/buddy movie. Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal are good together in this.  This is probably my favorite Streisand move.  It is a romantic comedy.  Ryan O'Neal plays a  has been boxer trying to make a comeback and she  becomes his manager.  And doesn't know anything about boxing.  This isn't Rocky.  But it's pretty good. This is a good concert dvd.  To me more then anything it shows how he can do any kind of music.  And how especially good he can do 50s type music.  He has so many songs he can not possibly do them all even as a medley.  He also does standards like My Funny Valentine.  And his own songs like Smoky Mountain Rain.  I think you don't even have to be a big Ronnie Milsap fan to enjoy this. This dvd does have the cast talking about some of the skits they did.  But it just shows some clips from some of the skits not the whole thing.  They have put some of the complete shows on dvd now.  That would be better.  But I haven't gotten any of them. This is not really what I thought it was going to be.  I thought it was going to be a concert dvd.  When she performs live on stage  it's good.  And she does songs like This Kiss and Breathe.  But when she's not singing there is too behind the scenes stuff.  Someon needs to come out with just a concert dvd of her. This was t.v. movie.  About a secret service agent going after some terrorists who tried to kill the President.  Mariel Hemingway as the secret service agent is very good.  And the movie is pretty intense. I know they made at least one more of these.  And I watched it.  But this was the last Scary Movie that I bought.  It was running out of steam.  And really how often can you watch something like this.  This is mostly a parody of Signs and The Ring.  Leslie Neilson is  his over the top self as The President. There are two shows on this disc. The first one with George Jones Faron Young and Tammy Wynette.  Geogre sings White Lightnin'.  The second one also has Tammy Wynette and Merle Haggard who does Okie From Muskogee. I was a teenager when this was on during the '70s  And I used to watch this every week.  This  season also has the pilot movie that explains what happened to him and he got his bionics.  It's pretty good.  This is the only season I bought of the dvd.  I enjoyed watching it once.  But it is not something I wuld really care about watching over again. I have a few of these Hee Haw dvds.  I grew up watching it.  And still catch it in reruns when I can.  I bought this one for Barbi Benton.  Who at one time was a regular on the show.  She sings Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep.  And dolly Parton does her original version of I Will Always Love You.  And Love Is Like A Butterfly. These are two more complete Hee Haw shows.  The first one has Hank Williams Jr.  before his mountain climbing accident when he looked completely different.  And Dottie West.  Buck Owens does Charlie Brown.  He always did those kind of songs well.  The second show has Loretta Lynn and Merle Haggard who does I Take A Lot Of Pride In What I Am. I was glad to see this finally released on dvd.  Tony Curtis does very well as Ira Hayes a Pima Indian who was one of the flag raisers on Iwo Jima.  How he didn't quite fit in as a Marine.  And how he couldn't adjust back to civilian life after the war.  Very well done. This is a stand up comedy concert of Rich Little he does a lot of his famous impersonations.  And a impersonation of Dr. Phil that will leave you rolling n the floor. I have a few of these Hot body dvds.  They all are pretty much the same.  Girls dancing around stripping until they are totally nude.  This one has a girl named Cricket that will get your blood going.  I have different priorities now then I did when I got these. But you know what your getting if you get any of these. This is a pretty good dvd.  It is clips from Johnny Carson's tonight show.  Featuring country artists.  Which for me the highlight is The Judds doing Grandpa.  There are also sketches.  Like James Drury and Doug McClure in a bar room brawl.  It just isn't something you want to watch everyday. This is a pretty good movie.  I think everybody pretty much knew Hilary Duff.  But I didn't know Haylee.  Who I like better.  They play Hilton type sisters.  Heiresses to a family cosmetic fortune.  Who pretty much lose everything in a scandel involving  the company.  They fight back even though they pretty much don't have any skills of their own.  This isn't a bad movie.  There are some laughs.  And it's good to watch every once in awhile. This is a true story of a New York City Police Officer who won't take bribes.  When he goes to his superiors they even encourage him to.  As you get more into the story he becomes more of an outcast.  As he lives a hippie lifestyle and seems like the only honest cop on the police force.  This movie is slow at times.  But it always makes you feel what he is going through. This is a pretty good dvd.  Of Johnny Cash himself and some of his guests on his t.v. show.  There are a lot of artists on here.  From Bob Dylan, Creedence Cleaarwater Revival, James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt and Ray Charles.  To country guests like Glen Campbell and Merle Haggard.  Highlights are Johnny singing Daddy Sang Bass and Glen doing Wichita Lineman.  But just about every performance on here is good. This show  was always good,  And still is no matter how many times you watch it.  Season seven wasn't as good.  But season eight was better.  My favorites on disc one are Banking On Marcy and Take My Wife Please.  Disc two are Dancing With Weezie, Sofa So Good.  And on disc three Legend Of IronHead Haynes and Kelly Knows Something. This is a very good movie.  A group of MIT students led by one of their teacher's who recruits them.  Count cards and go to Las Vegas and come back with millions. But when the students start doing things there own way.  Things start going bad very quickly.  This is a very well done very well acted movie.  It is really intense.  And worth watching over again. The ninth season of this show was just as good as any of the rest of the seasons.  My favorite two episodes were each the two part I Want My Psycho Dad  and Ship Happens with a particularly annoying Gilbert Gottfried.  Tawny Kitaen and Keri Russell were also in episodes this season. This is a good movie.  And for all the movies that Tom Hanks ha made especially after this.  Things like Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan.  This is my favorite movie of his.  It probably helps if you love dogs.  Which I do.  He plays a detective who  pretty much inheriates a dog who is the only witness to his masters murder.  And it goes from there.  Just a all around good movie. When this was on.  I watched it every week.  It turned out to be one of those series that wasn't for everybody and they only made eight episodes.  I thought it was funny.  It's about intergalactic garbage men.  What else do you need to know.  Although her role was small it also had Misty Rowe in it. This is season 2 of Get Smart The Complete Series.  It is just as good as Season 1.  Would you believe it may be even better.  Again it is four discs with 30 episodes.  And a fifth disc with bonus stuff.  Don Adams is perfect as Maxwell smart.  He is sort of like Peter Sellers in The Pink Panther movies.  Except I think funnier. The Oak Ridge Boys got started in Gosphel music and put at least one Gosphel song on most of their albums.  I like to sing Gosphel music but I don't like listening to it that much.  I would rather that this had been a country concert.  But they do throw in Elvira and a few other country songs.  All in all this is a good concert. This  western is okay.  Robert Mitchum is good.  He plays a sheriff who's son got killed by an outlaw and he wants justice..  There is some moral questions in the movie about right and wrong and loyalty to your friends when you know they are wrong.  This movie is less then an hour and a half long.  It goes pretty fast. This is Season 3 of the Complete Series box set of Get Smart.  It has 4 discs of episodes and a fifth disc of bonus material.  There are 26 episodes and they are all funny.  This is still my all time favorite t.v. show. This is Season Four of The Complete Get Smart t.v. series box set.  Again there are four discs of episodes and one disc of bonus features.  It is great how Don Adams and all the rest of the actors can do this and not be able to crack up.  And it is just as good all these years later. The fifth season of Get Smart turned out to be the last season for it.  By now Smart and 99 were married.  She was still called 99.  This set is just like the others with four discs of episodes and one disc of extras.  AS far as I'm concerned this is still the funniest t.v. show of all time.  And even though this was the last season it was still just as good. This turned out to be the last season of Charlie's Angels.  Jaclyn Smith was the only Angel to be around for the whole run.  And there is no Farrah at all.  Tanya Roberts joined the cast.  But it seems like this was the second season without Kate Jackson and it never really recovered from that.  I was so glad when this was finally released to have all the seasons on dvd. I think I have probably seen the Statler Brothers live.  More times then anybody else.  Once with Lew and the other times with Jimmy,"  The only thing wrong  with this is.  That even while you are watching this.  You know this is their last concert.  They do a lot of their big songs. And some of their Gosphel songs too.  They went out with a bang. This is Kenny Rogers as The Gambler.  Based on the hit song.  Although the story of the movie is nothing like the song.  Kenny Rogers has a laid back acting style.  The movie is good.  Except for one part where the lady is shooting at the cowboys who are trying to keep The Gambler and hi friend form boarding the train.  Yeah right. Jeff Bridges as Wild Bill Hickock is over the top.  As he does everything from shooting a shot glass off the top of a dog's head looking backwards in a mirror.  To killing a man in a wheelchair in a gunfight.  I don't know how truthful this movie is.  But there is also Christina Applegate who I will watch anything she is in.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AACJUD2Y4DXWV," This like all the X-Men movies is a great watch and has great content and subject matter all through the movie ... if you're in axman fanatic you will like this movie ... I bought this movie for my kids when they were just little and now  one 37 and the other one is 35... we are planning to sit down and enjoy watching this one again at our new age of 30 years later This movie is first class all the way. From the actors to the plot, this movie will entertain you all the way with fine film work and theme all the way through.. There is nothing that I can say about this movie other than it is a classic... Superb acting great storyline and wonderful sets make this a fantastic movie to own especially in Blu-ray This is a pretty good action movie kind of different from Tom cruises usual role. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it was just a little slow in a couple places. This flick is first class all the way...Great sci-fy concept and some real thought about plot and stringing the movie into on piece...I would like to give it six stars if I could... It was fun to watch these old flicks that I had not seen since I was a kid. Quality is as good as could be expected as the media back then was not exactly Blu-Ray quality...Good investment if you want to add some oldies to your collection... I always enjoyed the originality and the spontaneity of the series. I am happy to recommend this to anyone and for me I am just adding this to complete the missing episodes of the series. I still feel that this is one of the best adventure movies I've ever seen... Superb acting great sets and wonderful photography and this for me was an upgrade to Blu-ray This is a great movie that I somehow missed in my life...So I bought it to watch the whole picture from stem to stern. Great cast and acting...Well worth the money... I still feel that this is one of the best adventure movies I've ever seen... Superb acting great sets and wonderful photography and this for me was an upgrade to Blu-ray This is a great movie that I somehow missed in my life...So I bought it to watch the whole picture from stem to stern. Great cast and acting...Well worth the money... I must admit this was a great purchase for me as I hadn't seen 2 of the three movies on this disk...Would recommend it to all of you that enjoy Stallone... I enjoyed watching this movie on TV enough that I bought one. This is not a perfect movie but is a nice movie to kick back launch on Saturday night with some sandwiches and a little conversation ... This movie brought the genius of the author of her book written by Ann Rand. Her prediction of the future was simply astounding, as we all can see we are there now as a society... Too much of "" Taken "". I expected much more out of Liam in this one...If they make Taken 3, it better really perform or they don't get my money. The movie isn't a bad movie, just a little boring... This in my opinion was a pretty good movie with lots of content and action ... The acting was pretty good from everyone involved and the storyline was involved with lots off detail... Well, I was wrong about Clint. I didn't think he had another good movie in his bones, but I would be very wrong. Buy this one folks for your library and you will watch it over and over again... Washington gave his usual exemplary performance as the seasoned actor that he is...I felt the emphasis on the drinking preoccupied the writers and degenerated the movie slightly...A little too much addiction... This movie is a very sweet and touching well-made movie and a great movie for the whole family. I was very pleased watching it and most women will have to bring the tear wipes with them.. This is a first class movie and drama...Nice to see somebody in Hollywood produce a good story line with out a bunch of boring sex scenes.(aren't you guys tired of all that slop) Good drama with a great cast... This movie made me realize that with some planing that a group of one world government worshipers could take the white house if our response time was that slow...Great plot and story line... Movie is worth buying for your collection...Not as good as the first two due to the sameness and lack of surprise content, but had some fun stuff in there...Hey, ya need this for your collection...Hope the next one knocks my socks off... This movie I give five stars for concept. The movie itself was a little slow in a few places, but is a really good flick and worth the money to get it... This was an excellent story with good storyline and fairly good acting... It is missing something and I just can't put my finger on it but otherwise it was worth the watch... Too much of "" Taken "". I expected much more out of Liam in this one...If they make Taken 3, it better really perform or they don't get my money. The movie isn't a bad movie, just a little boring... This is a superb movie about a true story and The Bravery of the men in this Coast Guard unit... this is a must-buy for all you folks who like to cry a tear and watch a great movie.... The movie did not disappoint and was every bit as good as the first two... The problem is is that I don't believe they're going to make anymore which is a shame... Too much historical content to put into one movie so movie kind of skips around. Acting was great but I was left with a bunch of empty parts that I know should be there but could not be in the movie because it would have made the movie too long. Movie was somewhat of a letdown and someways not is good as the first one ... this movie was totally dependent on CGI graphics and was a little predictable toward the end but was fun to watch ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ABVQ4VI0UHIK2," Violence and mayhem.  What ever the objective was of all the clandestine agents, the plot was lost on the horrific destruction of property and innocent lives as they pursued their quest.  It would be nice to see something where intellect prevails over brute force. Started out rather frivolous but was quite engaging.  Alan Rickman gave a stellar performance.  This great actor is truly missed.  The entire cast was well placed and everyone did a great job. Great Movie.  This film had substance, interest, and is far, far, superior to the trash being produced today.  No need to spoil it for the viewer.  A good watch and worth a repeat. Wonderful film about saving children.  One thing the film makers could have done was less time wasted on close-up facial expressions and more dialogue and a little more attention to detail and the true horrors of homelessness suffered by the orphans of war. This could have been a 6-star plus production if more time and effort had been put into the making of this film.  In any event, get the tissue box ready. Very predictable.  All the clues were so obvious.  Of course, this is an old film and there is no way somebody investigating an old murder case is going to share information with a reporter. Good plot, but overdone with way too much violence and unbelievable heroics.  Way too many innocent people killed.  Of course, never the hero of the film.  That all being said, it will break the boredom of a snowy afternoon. I would not call this a normal farm family.  They remind me of a bunch of squatters using up what is left of the place.  Everything needs repairs and a 10-year-old could tend to.  I hope people who live in cities do not think this is the way farm families really live.  We all pitch in and get the work done!!!  This place in this movie is a disgrace and so are the characters. This is about a Russian immigrant's son gone wrong, a father who is a bit of a low life, a mother dying of a brain tumor, a younger brother in awe of the brother gone wrong.  The ways of the criminally insane, incapable of remorse, are depicted in this film..  Heartless, cruel, depressing.  A waste of life all the way around. What is this supposed to be?  Plays out like a fairytale.  At 20:00 and injured soldier rides into camp to bring news of the deaths of husbands and sons and the women just let him lie on the ground suffering without lifting a hand to tend to his wounds? First off the gosh awful music at the beginning was a turn off.  The plot read like a morphine nightmare.  Not worth my time.  Others may like digesting it, but not for me. This one has to start out with two strangers coupling and making noises like they are constipated in the outhouse.  Tacky.  Probably no substance to this.  Just not worth my time to watch. Not a bad comedy.  If the travesty of mishaps were not to typical of what really can go wrong in our travels, it could have been a drama instead of a comedy.  I am sure most viewers can relate to this film.  Likeable characters. Five stars is not enough.  This is a masterpiece of production, story line, acting, and such a true realistic depiction of the human condition,  an orphanage where children grow up with love whether they ""get a home"" or not.  Also, the tragedy of human decisions gone wrong.  This leaves the viewer wanting a sequel on what happens to every precious little life in the orphanage as they become of age. Wiretapping expert he was.  Rational thinker not.  This guy was truly paranoid.  Will not reveal the plot, but the viewer keeps waiting for something profound.  There is a twist to this as the wiretapper misinterprets what he had heard.  Good enough watch until the end.  Great acting.  Looks like a bit part by Harrison Ford in his early days. Hard to watch.  Logic says there can be no drug trade unless there are people stupid enough to use it.  Our society has become so degenerate if it were not drugs, they would find something else to destroy themselves with.  The war on drugs has always been futile because of this. This is an excellent film with a profound message about respect for one another as human beings and respect for all of creation.  This is about a man who in the 1930s was born English but lived like an Indian in Canada.  He was a trapper later turned conservationist.  Please listen to the message in this film; it's never too late. A bit of a different spin on people who are desperate for a better life and the corruption that goes on with both sides of the border.  A sheriff uncovers corruption in his own family and some members of the border patrol.  This does have a somewhat happy ending.  Very good acting for the most part.  It's worth a watch. Lovely sweet story; however, disappointed in the film makers.  My goodness they kept hauling the manure spreader around trying to pretend they were doing field work with it.  There were a lot of fairy-tale concepts about farming.  All that being said, it was a nice film with a happy ending.  Great for city audiences who want a little taste of country with a heart-warming story woven in. Just the right amount of humor and romance to make this a must see.  These two find a hole in the future and the past so it spans the 19th to the 21st Century.  He from the past she from the future.  Happy ending.  Loved it. This is very difficult to watch.  I cried through so much of it.  It does reveal the horrors of war and what men went through.  Also, the devastation experienced by the civilians. Great story covering one woman's trials and brutality at the hands of her husband on a remote unfinished homestead in Canada in the 1850s.  One must watch this until completion as the story can get a bit confusing.  Great ending. Very painful story with twists and turns depicting the tragedy of human lives and the effect childhood horrors have on people in their later lives. Misdirected vengeance ensues.  It also shows how even children can be evil doers.  This film leaves a person feeling very disturbed. Movie about pitiful dysfunctional human beings.  If you enjoy watching misery, this is the movie for you.  Not to my liking.  I just wanted to get in there and clean up that horrible mess. Genocide in Rwanda fueled by hatred and ignorance.  This is a story of a few Tutsis who were spared through the tenacity, bravery, and intelligence of a hotel manager.  If you do not know the history, you need to see this film.  You will weep for mankind and wonder why history repeats itself over and over and over again. This is a movie about racism, lack of communication, people acting before they think, suspicion, language barriers, and people just acting like Neanderthals.  Some happy endings and some tragedies.  People packed into a society like sardines and everybody struggling to survive as best their mentality will take them. This film would have been better without some needy woman lurking around Oded.  The sex scenes were not necessary.  Why not just show somebody straining in the outhouse if film makers want to be realistic.  A lot of time wasted on nonsense.  Some of the plot is totally unbelievable as far as clandestine operatives are concerned.  Way too transparent.  Otherwise, not a bad watch for a rainy day. Slow moving, supposedly a romance movie.  Lacking in substance.  If you do not mind watching a bunch of dysfunctional people drink, smoke cigarettes, and takes pills, this is the film for you!  Very disappointed.  Unbelievable that somebody who has never been out of the country can jump on a plane to Paris on a whim.  Passport please? This was simply a precious story about a tough guy and a sweet little girl, his daughter, who softened his heart.  Won't spoil it by telling more.  It is a must see.  I consider it a classic. Big mistake on opening scene.  The courtyard was full of people when the robbers entered the bank.  When those outside heard the machine gun firing, they would have called authorities right away.  So, in the film maker's attempt to be dramatic, they lost credibility right off the bat with this scenario. Big mistake on opening scene.  The courtyard was full of people when the robbers entered the bank.  When those outside heard the machine gun firing, they would have called authorities right away.  So, in the film maker's attempt to be dramatic, they lost credibility right off the bat with this scenario. I suppose it is a good watch, but I truly detest films that start out with a morning kitchen scene with everybody late for something and not eating, rush, rush, rush.  So dysfunctional and boring to me.  So I clicked off.  I suppose the producers are trying to get the audience to identify with these scatter brains. Okay movie.  A lot more content could have been devoted to the scientific side of things instead of carnal displays.  I found myself googling the history during the entire film because more of it could have been included in the film. This is a must see for anyone who does not understand that innocent people just want to live.  No politics.  No religion.  Just live and love their families.  Very realistic; however, I would re-write the ending and give that surviving little boy a chance. This was simply a precious story about a tough guy and a sweet little girl, his daughter, who softened his heart.  Won't spoil it by telling more.  It is a must see.  I consider it a classic. Horrible the way young women are deceived in coming to this country for legitimate work only to be kidnapped into prostitution.  The scum of the earth are the men who use these girls for their perverted pleasures.  Interesting how criminals suffer indignation when another criminal steals their ill-gotten gains.  This is a must see with a just ending. Pretty horrible story about violent undeveloped minds of three kids from disadvantaged backgrounds thinking they can survive outside of society in the desert and committing all manner of atrocities.  No remorse for murder. As far as I am concerned this is a masterful production with good storyline, film, scenery, and acting.  I would even watch it again.  Honorable men truly exist among the dregs of the earth. I almost clicked this off because of the first few minutes showing a family of totally spoiled, materialistic, self-gratifying people.  I felt so sorry for the little body being treated like excess baggage, that I wanted to reach into the film and bring him to my home.  That being said, this turns out to be a good movie with great lessons, so don't give up on it even though you initially want to smack some sense into these people. This depicts just another human tragedy and the horrors of war people inflict on one another.  It is about a Japanese solider who returns home a quadriplegic with scars from burning and the nightmare he and his wife endure while she tries to care for him.  This movie ends in more tragedy and is extremely depressing. This is a classic movie about an Irish family who go to Australia during the potato famine as indentured servants, strike it rich, and then greed takes over.  An insight into the horrible treatment of the Australian natives.  Very sad.  But good movie with great photography and acting. Almost shut this one off, but gave it a go and it turned out to be pretty good.  Realistic, earthy, and good acting.  The story covers the human emotions of should have, could have, why me, had a person known, etc.  It ends well and there is hope.  Give this one a watch.  It starts off slow, but it will be worth your time.  The makeup artist could have gone easier on the eyebrows. Pretty good movie about financial crises between USA and Russia.  Jack Ryan, the Shadow Recruit, puts in a good performance.  Kevin, of course, good as always.  The movie starts out more believable than the ending.  Of course, don't we all wish we could perform super-human feats to achieve our goals.  Enjoyable watch and good ending. Kept waiting for some sort of plot.  Film seems to favor one child on their journey to.....I found this boring watching people stop at one fast foodie after another and children as in the dark as to what was happening I was. Films starts out with immoral couple discussing her posting nude for a porn magazine.  Her boyfriend shows up and her bedroom buffoon races out the back door with the boyfriend in pursuit.  I did not consider this worth my time as there I no way I could identify with any of the characters or empathize with whatever the outcome may be. Don't pass this one by about two mothers who lost their sons to malaria and what they did to help prevent more deaths in malaria.  This one is full of tears and compassion.  Get out the tissue and then don't forget to smile at the happy parts and thank God for all the  people who care about others. This film drags trying to get to the plot of it.  It runs as if the viewer is supposed to know what is and what has happened.  Did not finish this.  Found it boring and not worth the watch. To start with you cannot accidentally shoot someone thinking they are prey if you are following all the rules of hunting.  Plain and simple.  No such thing as an accident, just carelessness and stupidity.  If you do not see 100% of your target and what is behind and beside it, you do not shoot. I must be dense or something.  I really have no idea what this story was trying to tell.  Too many missing parts to draw any conclusion as to what it is supposed to be about.  The acting was great, but what? xxx This will keep you on your seat.  You will be ready to click off due to what you may consider a tragic ending.  Give this one your time until the end.  You will be glad you did. If you are tenderhearted, do not give up on this one.  It starts out a bit slowly, but really builds into something wonderful.  Great acting, and loved the slow unassuming pace of the main character. Outside of wanting somebody to comb that mother's hair for the first 30 minutes it was interesting.  The first half drags.  We are talking retroactive time travel here, which is an interesting concept.  Not a bad movie; however, I found myself fast forwarding the parts that were dragging.  More of Einstein's research could have been explored in this movie. This presentation should make us all realize that, if people are not given a chance before it is too late, their lives can be irrevocably broken.  God bless all the people who helped this young girl to see that it was not too late for her to grab that chance for herself and her baby. I loved this sensitive character whose job it was to find family of departed souls who had no recent contact with any relative.  It was a nice slow-moving story.  That being said, I was furious at the sad ending.  I would like to re-write it.  If you like happy endings, you can skip this one. 26-six minutes in and the man is still driving his call talking on the phone obviously trying to keep the audience in suspense as to what is going on.  Total Bore.  Clicked it off The plot is difficult to follow until the end.  Basically Dwight's father was an unfaithful lout.  The other husband found out and killed Dwight's parents.  He went to prison, got out and Dwight killed him and all his brothers and/or kids, who knows.  Dwight's half brother from his father's relationship killed him.  Then it ends.  Ye gads, what a depressing little flick. A three eco-minded persons thought their blowing up a dam would ""help save the environment.""  Their educated yet infantile minds could not grasp the ramifications of such an action.  Their elation at their success soon turned to life lost, hatred toward one another and their selves.  Basically, they had committed one criminal act after another.  The film leaves the the viewer to assume the fate of the two survivors.. Cannot even get into this.  Natural disaster strikes, tectonic plates shift, below freezing temperatures set in.  A spoiled American family on vacation in Egypt feel they are so darned important that all manner of conveyances are going to be at their disposal so they can go home while thousands around them suffer.  They are all so puffed up with self-importance it is pitiful.  The acting and plot stink to high heaven. This movie incorporates drama with a bit of humor, and includes pain and suffering caused by others.  If you have the patience for a very good watch with excellent cast and story line, sit back and enjoy. Thought provoking.  At what point do we allow people to suffer until the very end against their wishes?  We have seen it over and over again where the patient says DNR/DNI and the family decides to override the patient's wishes and prolong their misery with feeding tubes and artificial means simply because they cannot bear to see them go, and the eventuality is still there.  They increase their own misery right along with the terminal loved one's agony. Declined to watch due to all the references of the Song of Solomon.  Wow, the Biblical character was quite the womanizer, and since no man is worth sharing, decided not to view. Great movie about walking the middle line to success by trying to be up front, focused, and somewhat honest, while at the same time, jeopardizing the safety of others to do so.  Many issues are addressed in this film.  Well acted. Surprisingly well done about men's escape from prison and the quest for ill-gotten gold.  This film will keep your interest.  Some pretty rotten characters, but a person was still hoping they would straighten out.  The younger criminal had some redeeming qualities.  The acting was very good. This could have been a good movie, but the main actress and the producers were so obsessed with showing her mouth and teeth to the exclusion of everything else that it became mundane.  Also, the actress should have been showing a bit of fear instead of delight that her predictions were coming true.  This is a movie if a person has nothing better to do. Good acting, but sloppy detective procedure.  They talk to the press when they should not.  They stake out in front of houses and buildings without covering the back.  The outcome is usually predictable as are the prime suspects. This was barbaric and brutal showing a mentality that has not evolved for centuries.  I felt empathy for the fate of all concerned, especially the children who are victims of their parent's inability to progress beyond what they know. This movie will depend on your moral judgment.  I found it disrespectful to women and men obsessed with their bottom halves.  I did not consider it worth getting past the F words. This is very difficult to watch.  I cried through so much of it.  It does reveal the horrors of war and what men went through.  Also, the devastation experienced by the civilians. I may change my mind on this one, will see.  But when a film starts out with men professionally dressed and their female coworker clad in a tank top, I cannot help but wonder what the producers are thinking. Incredibly boring.  I gave this one 30 minutes, and all I could think of was that the writer could not even clean up the back yard with junk lying all over the place.  He may be been a writer, but quite the pansy out of place anywhere earthy.  I thought were it not for the wife, there would have been no story at all. I thought the scenery and horses were worth the watch.  Don't care much for the macho men sitting around drinking and smoking.  There could have been a better story told in this beautiful country setting. Could not get past the first few minutes.  Bunch of young fellas drinking, shooting guns, and up to no good.  Got off easy even though they had been in trouble before.  Typical Texas ""good old boys"" looking after their own in a small community where sins of the locals are overlooked. Starts out with some gal drying her polished nails with a hair dryer.  If you have 3 minutes to waste watching her do this, this film is for you.  Incredibly boring start.  I don't think it is worth my time to try to figure out what I am supposed to be watching.  May as well watch somebody straining on the stool. It is always the female that bears the ""shame"" of an error in judgment.  Males need to feel ashamed of themselves for their own lack of restraint and society needs to quit putting so much on the females and hunt down the males and make them share in the responsibility that comes with bad decisions. Guy went to prison, deserved it.  Got out.  Accomplice buddy who did not get caught into all sorts of low-life stuff.  Minutes, and minutes and minutes wasted watching 4 low-life individuals drink themselves into oblivion.  Pitiful.  A waste of time, clicked off. A person cannot help but want to re-write the script and shake some sense into the insufferable, insolent, spoiled rotten teenager.  If suppose the survival would have been easier without her stupidity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AN2W5U5RDCTL7," This one is a popcorn-chewer of the first order!  Terrific performances by Harrison Ford and the always astounding Gary Oldman head an excellent cast in this wonderful nail-biting trip on the President's plane!  The blu-ray is a fine program release. Pleasant Bing Crosby, STUNNING Rosemary Clooney and terpsichorean talents Vera-Ellen and brilliant comic actor Danny Kaye headline this wonderful Irving Berlin-tuned Christmas package.  I saw it in ""Vista-Vision, Motion Picture High Fidelity"" upon its release in 1954 and find it to be a continual pleasure year after year.  Watch for a young George Chakiris in Clooney's backup group in the ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"" number--- about 6 years before his Oscar-winning turn in ""West Side Story."" Walt himself was disappointed in the results of his decades-long quest to film ""Alice in Wonderland.""  Indeed, it's not so much ""Lewis Carroll"" as it might be but it's lots of colorful fun and remains a favorite of this ""big kid"" who was of target age upon its initial release!  Besides that-- it made me aware that mushrooms come in ALL sorts of varieties!!!  (LOL) A fascinating and fun film featuring superb performances from the highly underrated Fred Ward (producer as well), the young Alec Baldwin and the should-have-been-Oscar-nominated turn by Jennifer Jason Leigh, creating one of the most ""real"" characters I've ever encountered on film.  She is simply wonderful---- as is the highly off-beat movie!  Pick this one up for a movie night with friends who are DESPERATE for real Adult Entertainment....that is, a movie for grownups!! Excellent time-warp film.  Premise has Commander Kirk Douglas and company dealing in the late 70s with Japanese Zeros and a menacing task force-- of Japanese carriers, etc, on the way to--wait-- Pearl Harbor on December 6, 1941.  Fun, speculative film with dated special effects and first-class performances. Great fun film!!  Excellent blu-ray.  Ray Harryhausen's work is fabulous and the film is great G-rated entertainment!! The kids will love the Cyclops and the sword-fighting Skeleton!!  Amazing work from a master that does not grow old. As to casting, remember that it's a FANTASY STORY. Simply one of the greatest of films! Charlie and Jackie's interplay is delightful.  The restoration is astounding!  Though almost a century old, much of the film looks like it was shot yesterday-- with a real camera and film!  With an informative commentary and a wealth of extras, ""The Kid"" should be on the shelf any movie lover with a remote interest in the history of film. One of the finest adaptations of Shakespeare on film, ""Richard III"" comes to us in a beautiful Blu-ray release.  The restoration is magnificent; Technicolor photography is gorgeously reproduced.  And, of course, the performances from Olivier, Richardson, Bloom, Gielgud, et.al, are a continuous lesson for aspiring actors and an aural treat for viewers/listeners who love to hear our great English language greatly spoken!!  This is the way it should be done!  Criterion has outdone themselves with this Blu-ray release! One of the restorations of the year!!!!  This brilliantly restored film has not looked so great since its premiere in 1965.  I saw that initial engagement and, with THIS PARTICULAR RELEASE, the film looks just like it did in the Criterion Theatre on Broadway!! Excellent ""box"" presentation of the beautifully-done Jackson remake of the 30s classic.  Good points include technical wonders and a brilliant performance by the great Andy Serkis as Kong!  (Yes, folks, this amazing actor gives a REAL performance!!).  Bad points are an over-long theatrical version and a MORE over-long extended version.  We didn't need all the ""Lion King"" running through dinosaur legs. Interesting for work of leading actors--- but mediocre.  Not worth the time.  Title and lead characters are the only thing that are authentic.  The storyline is completely different from Doyle's original. Simply one of the greatest of films! Charlie and Jackie's interplay is delightful.  The restoration is astounding!  Though almost a century old, much of the film looks like it was shot yesterday-- with a real camera and film!  With an informative commentary and a wealth of extras, ""The Kid"" should be on the shelf any movie lover with a remote interest in the history of film. Wonderful collection of Dame Maggie's BBC appearances over the years.  Here she is as a young Portia, Shaw's hysterical ""Millionaress"" and more, including a hair-raising turn in Tennessee Williams' ""Suddenly Last Summer"" as  Violet Venable with the late Natasha Richardson as Catherine....who was on the beach with Sebastian when...... TV transfers look pretty good on this 3-disc collection and I recommend it to fans of Dame Maggie Smith without hesitation. No movie masterpieces here,  just loads of film fun featuring a good look at WWII-era ""entertaining"" films.  ""Tutti-Frutti""ed Carmen Miranda,, the great Vivienne Blaine and company provide some great times and a look at home-front distractions during the War. .

Watch for a young George Chakiris in Clooney's backup group in the ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"" number--- about 6 years before his Oscar-winning turn in ""West Side Story."" The genius who figured out and engineered this ""finale"" should have been given a special Oscar.  The film are loved by children but this one is very special to ANY ""grown kid"" who had at least one toy .  Keeping a box of tissue handy is a good idea!  LOL Stephen King calls it the best American horror film in years. As far as I'm concerned, add a copy of the Swedish original (""Let the Right One In"") and you will OWN the two best horror films in years.  Period. Hardly a great film, this one's a fun romp in 3-d.  I had enough fun with the 3-d ""show"" that I'm gifting one to another 3-d-at-home fan!!  That doesn't mean that it deserves more stars!!  It's a fun mess.  Leave it at that.  (Oh, Jovovich is the most untalented actress alive.  Good thing she's married to the director!!!) I'm a fan of director Baz Luhrman but I was afraid for this adaptation when I heard ""rap-k-rap"" music on the soundtrack of the commercials.  I skipped the film in the theatres. The 3-D presentation on blu-ray is excellent, the mostly-good, often-inappropriate background score doesn't detract too much.  What amazes me is WHY, WHY, WHY use anacronistic music in a film about THE JAZZ AGE!!!!!!??!  Doesn't compute, Baz! That Peter Pan kid surely had a number of interesting ""beginnings,"" or so public-domain allows!  But producers still see fit to channel  profits from projects involving Peter to the Children's Home in London to whom author Barrie left the rights.  This one is a colorful imagination that emerged as an entertaining mini-series a year or two back.  Good family entertainment attractively presented in a fine blu-ray release. The quality of the disc is superb with first-rate picture AND two equally effective sound tracks.  The performance is simply sublime.  This disc is not to be missed!  Excellent packaging and swift service! It's not the David Lean 1946 version, but what is?  Quite good for the most part but not really up to past versions.  Pretty well cast. Helena Bonaham Carter not quite up to Miss Haversham but Ralph Fiennes is superb as Magwitch.  Interesting casting for ""Pip""--- Jeremy Irvine (""War Horse"") is the elder Pip and his younger brother plays Pip as a boy.  Mike Newell directs.  Excellent blu-ray release. Nice combo pack featuring gorgeous blu-ray editions of three of Hitchcock's 1940s classics. I got it at a great price and am most pleased. Flimsy packaging but the innards are superb!! At last this colorful CinemaScope film is available on blu-ray.  Looks good but colors could be a bit more vivid.  Sound quality (2.0-1) is excellent, enhancing the wonderful music score.  Sophia Loren's American debut stunned.  Just note the first sequence and you will know why! A delightful, interesting production of the classic Tchaikovsky favorite by the Dutch National Ballet company.  Beautifully presented with excellent picture quality and a choice of lossless sound!  Best of all, the ""Lagniappe"" (something ""extra"" in New Orleanese)...... hours of excerpts from ballet and operatic releases on blu-ray by Arthaus Musik!  A great buy even if the promotional price isn't still there!! If it IS there, then this is the perfect stocking-stuffer for arts-minded youngsters next holiday! The tongue-in-cheek, satirical ""Demolition Man"" is why I bought this set at a great price!!  The 3-movie set offers good ride all around for Stallone (and Russel) fans.  Lots of fun at a bargain-basement price. The quality of the discs is fine. This collective set is superb, beautifully-boxed, easily manipulated and shelf-fitting with the rest. The content is simply  top-of-the-line, 25 years worth of vintage Christie thanks to all concerned, especially the Hercule Poirot of David Suchet whose characterization of the great Belgian detective is in a class with the Sherlock Holmes of Jeremy Brett. Absolutely superb bio of the mercurial Orson Welles.  Acting students should be tied to a chair and forced to listen to this MAGNIFICENT AMERICAN VOICE until they stop whispering on stage and film. Stunning new version of the Hardy novel.  Gorgeous photography and fine performances all around put this 2015 release right on my shelf next to the more-""epic"" Schlesinger/Christie/Bates/Stamp/Finch release from the 1970s.  Picture and sound quality are outstanding. Fascinating Canadian film-- it's first ""horror"" movie (according to on-disc comments).  It's a bit hokey in the story department, but the 3-D segments (""Put on the Mask!!"") are quite good and definitely bizarre!!  This is an astounding restoration!!!  Picture quality is, for the most part, excellent. Matt Damon, a fine supporting cast and a literate, adult-oriented script bring this first-rate speculative sci-fi film to home theatre via this teriffic 3-D blu-ray release, with fascinating extras and a just-as-good 2-D BR discs as well. Excellent ""box"" presentation of the beautifully-done Jackson remake of the 30s classic.  Good points include technical wonders and a brilliant performance by the great Andy Serkis as Kong!  (Yes, folks, this amazing actor gives a REAL performance!!).  Bad points are an over-long theatrical version and a MORE over-long extended version.  We didn't need all the ""Lion King"" running through dinosaur legs. Superb performances and production values are in evidence in the completion of the BBC project ""The Hollow Crown.""  Benedict Cumberbatch's ""Richard III"" tops the list of stellar performances. Disc quality is first rate. Thank God that Ol' Ted did NOT :colorize"" ""KANE.""  The innovative b&w classic is superbly rendered on this blu-ray release.  The bonus is the DVD of ""Ambersons,"" the saddest case of studio butchery in film history.  ""Ambersons"" is STILL teriffic, though. This performance from 2012 at Glyndebourne in England is simply superb!!  Reset In the mid-20th century, the concept works beautifully and the performance is tops from all concerned-- performers and orchestra alike! Gorgeous presentation on a perfect Blu-ray. Excellent upgrade from the dvd box set but, sadly, Warners did not see fit to include blu-ray remastering of two of the films from that original set--- ""Angels With Dirty Faces"" and ""The Roaring Twenties.""  Otherwise, a good-quality set Superb picture and sound on this compelling and stunningly performed presentation of the R. Strauss shocker!  Wonderful bonus -- hours of excerpts from other operatic and symphonic blu-ray releases.  It may be ""promotional,"" but the price is right, the promos are gorgeous-- and we've already raved about ELEKTRA!! Fleming is still at her best in this performance as is Sophie Koch. But it's Diana Damrau who astounds here!  What a voice-- and what a final trio!!  Beautiful, fairly traditional production without any directorial ""improvements.""  Kauffmann sings the interrupted tenor aria in Act 1 beautifully.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A20Z437RMKI47S," Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a children's story from Walt Disney with delightful songs and fun scenes such as animated armor from the museum repelling a German invasion of England during WWII.  It's quite suitable for children.  Our son loved it when he was 3 years old; he learned all the songs and would sing and dance along with the movie as the VHS tape played. The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of the greatest of the great classics of science fiction films, and this version is the best presentation I've seen of it.  It was great to see the film again with the picture and sound restored to their original theatrical glory. Mel Gibson is brilliant a Fletcher Christian in this lavish production of the tale of ill-fated last voyage of The Bounty.  This has always been my favorite rendition of the story, and to the best of my knowledge is the most historically accurate.  It's much more focused on the telling of the tale instead of just being a send-up for famous actors. I enjoyed every moment of this rendition of the C. S. Forester's tales of the career of Horatio Hornblower in the British navy.  The devotion to historical accuracy is most impressive, and Ioan Gruffudd's portrayal of Hornblower is precisely as I had imagined him while reading the novels. There is nothing here but political hate brainwashing aimed at the nave and the gullible.  The message is always the same:  ""Give us your money and we will feed your fantasy of feeling powerful and superior by licensing your hatred.""  If you really want to know what this thing is about, read the 1-star reviews. I was in high school when Hogan's Heroes first appeared on broadcast television, and looked forward to watching each of the new episodes as they came out.  It's just as fun today as it was back then. The Secret of Niimh is, of course, a funny-animals cartoon with a fantasy setting, and in that it does its job well and is lots of fun.  Production values are extremely high and maintained throughout.  It also has an underlying element of human warmth reflected in the comedic behavior of the cartoon characters--""Girls like sparklies!""--as well as no small measure of heroics.  Good stuff. Three homicidal maniacs murder two and kidnap three innocent people.  Then they drive around in a car for 90 minutes, along with the cameraman, for 90 minutes while the hostages beg for mercy.  Then the movie ends.  Hammy acting, absurd cinematography, zero plot development, and the bad guys win.  This is just about as bad as a movie can get. Syrup is a cerebral comedy with quite a bit of underlying insight into manipulative marketing techniques.  The humor seems to operate at least two levels throughout, one the obvious broad guffaw while beneath it is the thoughtful irony of how easily the human mind is manipulated by unscrupulous marketeers. From the misleading cover image through the inept script and weak plot, ""Testing Life"" drags on into the oblivion of best-forgotten Indie films.  This tale of an unscrupulous drug company taking advantage of the poor, defenseless hopeful heroine is completely implausible in the setting of 21st century Germany.  I could find no redeeming value at all to this one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AWYITJ9IUMYKH," Two Wolfgang Petersen directed films together in one package is all you could want, with fine picture quality and all the extras from the old DVDs.  ""Air Force One"" in particular is excellent. My Blu-ray arrived on time, and played fine. Must have been one of the early releases though, as it dates from 2006, same extras as the 2001 DVD.  ""The Fugitive"" is still an excellent film, one of the best  TV series adapted to film ever made. Fine HD Blu-ray upgrade from the old DVD  still only has the theatrical trailer, but much underrated film starring James Woods and Brain Dennehy is well worth watching. Released by Olive Films, Fine Blu-Ray upgrade from Kino Lorber of this action/Sci-fi tale is the sequel to ""The Land That Time Forgot"", and previously paired with it on the old Midnite Movies DVD. Contains a director commentary with Kevin Connor, as well as on-camera interviews with co-stars Sarah Douglas and Dana Gillespie. Fine film based on the real life escape of three Alcatraz prisoners looks fine on Blu-ray, though the lack of any extras(same as the DVD) is most disappointing. Still a worthwhile film. Good Kino Lorber  Blu-ray upgrade from the old DVD has fine picture quality, though the only extra is still the theatrical trailer. Exciting action picture with Charles Bronson in good form. Long overdue release of this British Sci-Fi/Horror film starring the legendary Peter Cushing bypasses DVD altogether and makes its digital debut via Scream Factory in a flawless HD picture, with the theatrical trailer and a feature commentary being the worthwhile extras. An afternoon TV viewing staple for years can now be seen once again. Watch out for those silicates! Long overdue(due to legal limbo reasons) DVD/Blu-ray combo release of this entertaining thriller from 1971 that became an unexpected hit, ""Willard""  (played by Bruce Davison) is presented here by Scream Factory contains both an interview and feature commentary with the actor that is most interesting and fun. Trailers, TV and Radio spots are also included, with a pristine HD picture making this a must have for fans. Fine Kino Lorber Blu-ray upgrade from the old DVD still has the original theatrical trailer, but now an extended one as well, plus a deleted final image that would have cast the ending in a new light...

Blu-ray upgrade from Kino Lorber  of this popular Hammer films prehistoric adventure starring Raquel Welch in her star-making role is released on a 2-disc set that contains the original U.S. version and the longer international cut. Both are presented in stunning new 4K transfers, with good extras, including the fine Tim Lucas commentary on the international version. Excellent HD upgrade of this seminal British Sci-fi horror film from Hammer studios comes replete with many new extras including a commentary track with director Val Guest and Hammer historian Marcus Hearn, and  a nice featurette with director/fan John Carpenter. Good Blu-ray stars Sylvester Stallone as a ""Dirty Harry"" like rogue cop contains nothing new from the DVD, but still has the old extras including director's commentary, and good HD transfer. Excellent HD Blu-ray upgrade from Scream Factory may not have a Commentary track, but does have two interesting on-camera interviews with stars Heather Menzies and Dirk Benedict, who is a real hoot here recounting his experiences making it. Effective horror tale as well, with a striking ending not easily forgotten. Good Blu-ray stars Sylvester Stallone as a ""Dirty Harry"" like rogue cop contains nothing new from the DVD, but still has the old extras including director's commentary, and good HD transfer. Excellent Blu-ray collection of the original ""Planet Of The Apes"" films, with all five looking their best in HD, containing  all the old DVD extras and many new ones as well that make this a must have for fans Superb set with 15 Hitchcock films to choose from, 14 from Universal Studios, and one from Warner Brothers(""North By Northwest"") which was not included on the DVD set from years earlier. Picture quality was fine as well. Excellent Scream Factory release of this Horror favorite starring Linda Blair comes as a DVD/Blu-ray Combo Pack with the original commentary track retained, plus many new bonus features(like cast and crew interviews) that make it a must have for its fans, and a perfect reason to retire the old Anchor Bay DVD from years ago. Excellent and definitive Blu-ray release, this time from Scream Factory keeps all the old extras from the Critical Mass DVD, and includes many more in the 2-disc set of this cult hit from Canada about a most un-merry Christmas in a sorority house. HD Blu-ray upgrade from the old DVD has an interesting commentary from director Joseph Zito who has much to say about this now (much derided by critics) cult-classic. Also contains interviews with the writer and makeup team. Fine Blu-ray upgrade from Scream Factory of this haunted asylum thriller has all the old extras from the DVD, and two new featurettes that are worthy additions, particularly ""Horror's Hallowed Grounds"", which updates on the current state of the Danvers asylum. Exhaustive set of the four solo ""Alien""  films  is a must have for fans, with the first two pictures in particular looking great. Not a fan of the last two, but they all receive extensive extras and commentaries that will take days to get through! Blu-ray of Science Fiction horror tale has many extras and a fine transfer, even if the film itself is awful(though contains two gorgeous leading ladies in Dawn Dunlap and June Chadwick.) Exhaustive Blu-ray collection of the first four ""Die Hard"" films has them looking better than ever in HD, and loaded with extras for all films. Not to be missed, though you'll have to buy the fifth film separately. Nice Blu-ray of this classic film , now from Olive films which does not include the DVD commentary or documentary with them(presumably because of rights issues) but the one with Leonard Maltin is still there. Exhaustive Blu-ray collection of the first four ""Die Hard"" films has them looking better than ever in HD, and loaded with extras for all films. Not to be missed, though you'll have to buy the fifth film separately. Nice Blu-ray of this classic film , now from Olive films which does not include the DVD commentary or documentary with them(presumably because of rights issues) but the one with Leonard Maltin is still there. Superb 3-disc Blu-ray collection of this still wonderful  time-travel trilogy comes replete with new extras, and keeps the old DVD ones as well, including two commentary tracks. A must have for fans, and looks great in HD. Brian G. Hutton directed this pair of Clint Eastwood World War II adventures, and make an excellent double feature, though no new extras here , just what was on the DVDs, and the picture quality is fine.  ""Kelly's Heroes"" in particular is excellent. HD Blu-ray upgrade(from the double feature DVD) of this rather obscure British science fiction film comes with a trailer gallery and an interesting commentary track from historian Richard Harland Smith, though the film itself is dull and silly. Excellent and frightening film focusing on a previously untold case of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren comes to Blu-ray/DVD  in fine HD quality, with interesting extras as well(more on Blu-ray version), though no commentary track unfortunately. Both ""Speed"" I and II are included here, though the extras are the same as on the DVDs, they still look fine up-scaled to Blu-ray,  ""Speed"" is still excellent, though the sequel however is dreadful, but if you must own both films, this collection is ideal. Excellent Blu-Ray from Kino Lorber is an improvement on the old Midnite Movies DVD, with an interesting commentary track by Tim Lucas among other nice extras. Italian director Mario Bava creates a superb mood here in memorable Sci-Fi/Horror film. Both ""Alien Vs. Predator"" films are included here, and looking better than ever on Blu-ray. I preferred the second one to the first, but this an ideal way to have both together, with fine extras and commentaries. Parts II, III, and IV in the series look good on Blu-ray, though no new extras to be found, at least these have the correct aspect ratios.  ""Death Wish II"" is the best of the three by far, though a pity Part V(with another company) is not here, and still not on Blu-ray either. Blu-ray double feature from Scream Factory contains one good film(""Frogs"") and one bad(""Food Of The Gods"") Why they were paired together is bizarre, but at least ""Frogs"" has a fine HD transfer and good extras. Watch the other film if you must... Fine 7-disc collection of seven Clint Eastwood films from Universal Studios together in one Blu-ray package,  though contains nothing new from the DVDs. Films vary in quality of course, though have good HD transfers. Fine Blu-Ray upgrade from Kino Lorber of this good action/Sci-fi tale has a director commentary from Kevin Connor. Previously available as a Midnite Movies double feature DVD with its sequel is here presented by itself, but is well worth the purchase. Extras-packed Blu-ray version of still shocking thriller has three commentary tracks that are most interesting, from star Christina Raines, writer Jeffrey Konvitz,  and an older one with the (now) late director Michael Winner. Nice to finally have this film out on both DVD and Blu-ray in Region 1, but as others have noted, the complete lack of extras(not even the theatrical trailer! ) is most disappointing and unfortunate. Film looks perfectly fine on Blu-ray though, and is a must have for fans of Peter Cushing and the recently deceased Christopher Lee, who are by far the best things about it. Donald Sutherland also costars. All four ""Airport"" films from the 1970's are here in this fine collection, though there are no new extras since the similar DVD collection of years earlier. Still worth a purchase, with '77 being the best of the four. Equally excellent sequel is even better, telling another case of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren that comes to Blu-ray in fine HD quality, with interesting extras, though again no commentary track. Kino Lorber release of this John Boorman directed film set on an island in World War II looks stunning in HD, with interviews with the director and others, along with a commentary track. Fine Blu-ray upgrade of the old DVD is presented by Shout Factory with the theatrical trailer, radio spots, still gallery, and an interview with writer Tommy Cook. Entertaining suspense thriller with Timothy Bottoms as a disturbed yet clever young bomber pitted against investigators played by George Segal and Richard Widmark. Directed by James Goldstone. Scream Factory once again provides a Blu-ray upgrade from a previous MGM ""Midnite Movies""  DVD that looks fine in HD, even if the film itself is tepid. Still, at least this does have an interesting commentary track from the always reliable Tom Weaver, and an extensive photo gallery as extras, including the theatrical trailer. Excellent Blu-ray upgrade of this Amicus horror film with many famous stars like Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, and Jon Pertwee  comes from Scream Factory with fine HD picture and many new extras like two audio commentaries, featurettes, and various trailers and radio spots. A definite improvement from the old DVD from Lionsgate, and a must have for fans. Blu-ray of the Joyce Carol Oates short story filmed with the well cast Laura Dern, who is the best thing about this uneven drama. Like the old DVD, there are no extras whatsoever... an interview at least with Laura Dern would have been nice! Fine Blu-ray triple feature collection of three Paramount Studios westerns has all extras and commentaries from the DVDs, and  looks good in HD.  Two films starring John Wayne and the other directed by Sergio Leone as a follow-up to his all-time great ""Man With No Name Trilogy"", and ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" in particular, an all-time favorite of mine Blu-Ray version of three Alfred Hitchcock directed films ""Rebecca"", ""Spellbound"" & ""Notorious"" is a must have for fans, and contains al the old extras from the previous DVDs now in one convenient 3-Disc set, though nothing new is added. Double feature Blu-ray from Scream Factory is another strange pairing, though ""Jaws Of Satan""(first time on home video) does contain an excellent HD transfer(though the only extra is the differently titled theatrical trailer called ""King Cobra!), and ""Empire Of The Ants"" has more extras like a commentary track.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A31R6EP7VUO38D," I think this is one of the best Cheech & Chong movies. You don't have to be stoned to get it but I would imagine it helps. Good for a laugh. The days of California surf would not have been the same without Gidget and Moon Doggie! Bring on the beach party movies. Times were much different then and maybe not so bad. One of the better beach movies Not the best 3D movie ever but fun for what it is, and exploitation film just as advertised. I remember seeing the trailers in the theater and they were really fun. I saw it in LA at a screening and the crowd seemed to have a fun time. There are so many really wonderful documentaries out that and this one is not going to be getting a lot of great reviews I am sure. It is not bad but could have been much better. I enjoyed it and did learn a bit from it but I think it suffered by not having enough production value even though having some great subject matter. It was worth the money as it was not expensive so I am not disappointed. I happen to enjoy the scifi channel monster flicks. With a name like Dinocroc vs Supergator you can't expect more that what this is. It is not Avatar but a good couple of hours of laughs. Not exactly what I expected as there was an earlier animated Lone Ranger but interesting. Imagine William Conrad as the masked man. He goes by the name of J Darnoc here. I managed to see this play with no idea what it was about. I really loved it! I have seen many plays and this was one of my favorites. I am so glad that the broadway production was put out as this DVD. Thank you! I am so glad to be able to watch it over and over. I love the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies. This was my least favorite movie. I waited for it but realized I hadn't waited long enough. it was not the extended version I thought it was. Won't be ordering it now. Hoped it would be flushed out in the longer edition. Guess I will never know. I love the old lone ranger shows. This had some things on it I had never seen such as an original animated short. When they visited the Autry western set I enjoyed it but was sorry Clayton didn't play a more important part of it. It was probably because he would have had to come out of character and I don't think Clayton did that often. If you are a Ranger fan you will probably like this. This is certainly dated and probably means more to people like me that saw it in Cinerama. It has been awhile and I really enjoyed seeing Las Vegas when women were dressed up and the men were in suits. Not the same Vegas as today. I have been waiting for this one to binge watch. When it was live I tried to watch it but just didn't get into it. Now I have and it is all I was told. I recommend this, great show. I love the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies. This was my least favorite movie. I waited for it but realized I hadn't waited long enough. it was not the extended version I thought it was. Won't be ordering it now. Hoped it would be flushed out in the longer edition. Guess I will never know. There are so many unsung heroes in America. This movie was about the Japanese fighting in our war while their families were put into concentration camps. An embarrassment for the US but not the men who joined in the fight anyway. I for one am glad to see the old Cinerama films released. Sure, they are dated but for those of us who saw them in there full Cinerama release they are a treasure. I just hope they release Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm. I have the laser disk but it has a bit of pan and scan. I like the smile box on these DVDs. Makes it more like the theater presentation. Cinerama movies were an event in their time and it is great to be able to relive them again. I didn't think the Smilebox would work but turned out I loved it. Most of the Cinerama movies seem to have had this treatment but I am hoping for Brothers Grimm! Also the extras are informative and interesting. Well Done!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A6VJBC16YVBYY," Pretty sure my husband liked this more than I did and would give it 4 stars.  It is a good movie with an exciting finish but has a pretty high body count.  Terrorist are not my idea of entertainment. It had been probably 20 years since we saw this movie so we watched this again recently.  It is still one of our favorite Dustin Hoffman movies. Great supporting cast of Teri Garr and Bill Murray. Fun movie Can't believe we have never seen this movie when we are Julia Roberts fans.  It is a good story and we were pleasantly surprised.  It is a little raunchy in spots. Tried to find this movie to rent but found it on Amazon for a good price.  Still a classic after 20 years.  Better than the sequel that is out this year, 2016. Has lots of stars when they were pretty young so it is fun to see that.  It was kind of slow getting the story built up but it was a good story.  Did not like the ending. Such a sad man.  I just couldn't get into a show about a guy where everything seems to go wrong for him. It is a little too raunchy for me also. Love the mummy movies.  This one is packed with action almost too much non stop explosions and chases.  Maria Bellow does a nice job but I missed Rachel Weiss playing Evelyn. Kind of the same story as the others with a sleeping mummy army that is awakened.  Bought it for $7 instead of renting it for $4. Love the mummy movies.

I love the X men movies and this one gives you a good background story where Wolverine came from and why he is the way he is.  It is pretty violent in parts so not recommended for kids. It was good story with a lot of twists.  It kept us interested but way too many people are killed so casually.  We did not read the books so we didn't mind Tom Cruise in the staring roll.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A30KG14Z4SHO0Z," Great movie! Non stop action. It keeps you on the edge of your seat with suspense. The Russian boss had such a thick Russian accent that even though he was speaking English he should of had subtitles for just him never less it didn't take away from the awesomeness of the movie. Highly recommended to any Harrison ford and action movie lover Great 80's movie. A surprisingly great movie, being how the main plot is set around cleaning up a bar to have better crowd control against fighting. I would say that this movie is worth a watch loved this movie when I was a child and I still love it to this day. a great movie for kids to see. an all time disney classic. both me and my brother both saw and loved this movie. my all time favorite movie. based on a true story. a must see film. a fantastic film for me as a kid and still a fantastic film for me to this very day. shows what it is like to be transgender. These are 2 or Arnold's better movies. I can't think of too many action movies by Arnold that are bad. Great price for this double feature. Recommended to anyone who is a fan of Arnold or action movies truly the best scooby doo series that they have ever made. your always guessing till the very end as to who the ghost is. I enjoyed ever episode in the entire series. great to watch for both kids and adults. great price for the number of episodes that you get. Awsome 4 movie pack of the Indiana jones collection. All of the movies are great. Love the $35.00 price for all four. I also like the ultra slim DVD cases that are stored in one small size box case. Highly recommended truly the best scooby doo series that they have ever made. your always guessing till the very end as to who the ghost is. I enjoyed ever episode in the entire series. great to watch for both kids and adults. great price for the number of episodes that you get. great collection of scooby movies for the price. zombie island is my all time favorite scooby movie. the alien invasion is a great movie as well. great collection of movies that kids will love truly the best scooby doo series that they have ever made. your always guessing till the very end as to who the ghost is. I enjoyed ever episode in the entire series. great to watch for both kids and adults. great price for the number of episodes that you get. great collection of scooby movies for the price. zombie island is my all time favorite scooby movie. the alien invasion is a great movie as well. great collection of movies that kids will love Bought this double pack for both the movies. Clear and present danger was an awasome film. I enjoyed patriot games as well, although patriot games was a little slow moving for my taste a great complications of classic as well as newer roadrunner and coyote cartoons. got this as a gift for my dad. he loves it and i'm sure kids of all ages will as well. Good price for both the classic and the remake. It was a gift for my father and he swears that the original miracle on thirty fourth street is an all time classic. It's his must watch every holiday season 2 great movies from the 80's and 90's. great movies to watch when I was a kid and still great movies in 2016. great movies to watch for future generations to enjoy. great price for a blue ray. Another great die hard movie, action packed thriller! Unfortunately once you see it once the way they have the plot laid out it's hard to be shocked by the twist and turns when you already know what's going to happen One of nick's classic 90's cartoons, back when nick showed a wider range or cartoons and not just the sponge. Love the cartoon series and love their movie trilogy. Highly recommended to people who have kids. a cartoon from my childhood that I still enjoy to this day. great price of about 10 dollars. Disney didn't do as good of a job like they did with the other 2 seasons though. The first 2 they went all out by doing up the disks and the cases really nice. this season both the cases and the disks are really plain. an awesome movie. just be sure that you can watch the entire movie in one sitting, for there is no DVD menu or chapters. for about 8 dollars you would expect a movie to have this this dvd has the following episodes: the blob that ate everyone- was corny my hairrest adventure- was interesting with an amazing ending piano lessons can be murder- was excellent go eat worms- was corny and gross bad hare day- was ok revenge of the lawn gnomes- was pretty good overall a fairly good collection of goosebumps episodes for the price. recommended to any are you afraid of the dark fans. when nick toons were awesome in the 90's a must see for the newer generations and pairs nicely with the hey arnold the movie. with 99 episodes it is well worth the money and will keep kids interested and occupied for hours and hours. jaws 2 was a great film. jaws 3 was a pretty good film as well. jaws 4 was awful. although none can live up to the original film this collection is great add on to the classic film for the price. quite possibly the greatest disney movie since the 90's. a must see for people of all ages. worth the 25 dollar price. it was already watched several times by my family. the main movie haunted hollywood was an okay film; however, I didn't feel ripped off because the 3 bonus cartoons are worth the price alone. especially with the one all new bonus lego cartoon. great collection of cartoons form disney original series. the only episodes that were not that great were the lizzie mcguire ones. the other episodes from the other series were great. well worth the money. great for future generations to enjoy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A15TABYOILLLIO," If you like action and you like the president, you'll like this. Therefore we should think about electing Harrison Ford president. Otherwise forget it. You must have a president than likes America as well as himself for a change or forget it. Would this movie work today?  I doubt it. So just use your imagination and enjoy the movie while you can. Old fashion John Wayne movie that is timeless. I thought it had all the ingredients of a good western with suspense, action, typical John Wayne acting, and even a love story. It's funny to me, but I remember that era. I hope it can be funny for all ages because I would think it would have a universal appeal. These are true situation comedies instead of modern insults. Watch Mary Tyler Moore and how she progresses into a star on her own. New chief of security, new doctor. Deanna Troi's mother is so obnoxious, I skipped the ones with her in it. The episodes are still mostly full of imagination. Data is always good. Can artificial intelligence finally get so good that it breaks free and becomes human or even better? Can we do away with war on earth? Can we do away with money? Stay tuned. The creativeness of the plots are still intriguing. If we could update Star Trek to present technology standards, I wonder which things might be changed? It always shows us that our medical practices are definitely in the dark ages and designed only for profit. I try to learn something from each episode. That's pretty good from a TV show. The episodes are still good at this point; however, if you're streaming especially, they are no longer in high definition. Too bad. I don't see any reason why everything can't be in high definition. Every main character for sure gets the spotlight and that's good. It was very interesting and apparently historical with showing the inspiration to create Peter Pan. I wished it had had a little more information on actual events, but never the less Neverland was quite well done. Michael Kitchen plays this part like a master. People throw information at him both bad and good as the inspector sifts through it all and filters out the truth every time. The viewers are always so impressed they wish they too could learn his secret and apply it to their own lives. It always rates as five star. Comedy from a long past different America when parents took responsibility for being parents. To me it is funny; but, at the same time it's very sad to observe what's happened to the new generation. I just try to put myself back in that time and enjoy the humorous situations. Comedy from a long past different America when parents took responsibility for being parents. To me it is funny; but, at the same time it's very sad to observe what's happened to the new generation. I just try to put myself back in that time and enjoy the humorous situations. It was both interesting and depressing at the same time. It was depressing to think of the hardships she endured as a child and it was interesting up to a point to see how she overcame those adversities; but, I would have liked to have heard more about her work with the FBI and the TV show. It's funny to me, but I remember that era. I hope it can be funny for all ages because I would think it would have a universal appeal. These are true situation comedies instead of modern insults.

A2VS4DCHXJH3WS," Harrison Ford knows how to protect an airplane, but I wish he would not fly his personal planes over homes. Although I'm impressed with how well he recovered from a mechanical failure of his plane on a golf course and wish him good health in the future. James Belushi starred in 3 K9 movies. They are all touching, exciting and fun. James Belushi should definitely start a TV series: K9-Rin Tin Tin or something. I would definitely watch it, although sometimes I can't tell who the K9 is and who the dog is....LOL This one well told, well directed, enterprisingly photographed, warmly acted and most exciting 5 season TV shows I've ever seen. I want it extended to 15 seasons with the same crew in front and behind the camera!!! MacGyver is mediocre adventure, but his decent, caring and intelligent personality are life affirming and I feel better after watching most MacGyver  episodes. I wish Dean Anderson would revive MacGyver with maybe a different title like: MacGyver and Son or maybe MacGyver and Daughter.  Dean Anderson could provide the voice over and wisdom and the Son or Daughter could provide the action. I was amazed at how many aspects of this video were of such high quality. The Hubble digital photos in 3D were hypnotizing beautiful. The writing was informative and captivating. Leonardo De Caprio has a future doing voice overs for videos. I was thoroughly entertained. This action flick is pretty good if you just want to eat popcorn for an hour and a half. But I'm not used to seeing Dolph Lundgren as a villain. (Whoops ignore that last remark) This 3rd edition of the people munching Alligators (or Crocodiles) was beautifully photographed but the characters are paper thin and the story line is thinner than a human hair. But it held my attention anyway. I loved the 1st 4 seasons. Then I started wondering about the 5th and 6th seasons. The 7th season started unevenly, but is now back to being fresh, funny and smart. I still enjoy watching the fun. I like Psych. It is a well done comedy/mystery and I hope it continues for another 20 episodes. I liked the way they integrated the comedy/mystery acting with the song and dance.  But, now, can we get back to more juicy mysteries? Nice idea, but the pace was slow and ACE, the main character, was treated as an expendable character, definitely not the main character all the time. He appeared randomly in the movie, but many times the focus shifted to other characters. Therefore the movie had no suspense nor tension. And, if ACE was a young Sherlock Holmes, where was the bumbling Dr. Watson I ask you? This was unexpectedly entertaining. It was a mixture of a horror movie with a cyborg like soldier created by the military and a romantic drama where a friend of a soldier killed in action visits that soldier's family and gives the wife and children what they needed as far as protection and support. I wish they would make sequels or similar movies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2ANZYE6HTIUAO," OK, I'll say it.  If Harrison Ford ran for president I would vote for him.  This movie is packed with suspense, thriller and action with just enough sentiment to make it a straight up action flick. I loved this movie when I first saw it years ago that I bought the DVD.  I was not disappointed.  The character building, the emotion and the love all come through.  This is a great digital version of the film. Of course you can tell from the cover that the characters are expected to be a bit ditzy but really, through this funny movie the true meaning of friendship comes through. I love Denise Austin.  I love that the DVDs can be played in a manner to help you customize your workout and her positive attitude will help keep you going when you just want to stop.  This one even comes with some simple low fat, low calorie recipes. I love Denise Austin.

AEILI8S0HM2SF," This is my favorite Elizabeth Taylor movie of all the wonderful movies she did.  With Paul Newman, Jack Carson (my favorite character actor) and Burl Ives, you cannot go wrong. The acting is #1, the story line is great and very worth the price to have this in your collection. This is one of my favorite musicals. Being a musical and a comedy, when I need a laugh, I will get this one out.  The acting is awesome and many of the actors have passed away, but I love to remember them always. This is one of my favorite Audrey Hepburn movies, as I saw it on the plane in 1968 coming back from Germany. She has done many awesome movies. The suspense in this movie goes all the way to the end! Everyone will LOVE this movie! If you love Alfred Hitchcock, you will LOVE this movie.  As a fan of movies of the late 30's, 40's and 50's, I rank this as one of Hitchcock's best. I have gotten numerous A.H. movies from Amazon and love them all, including Strangers on a Train. Thanks to Amazon, I can get all my favorite older movies. This is a female flick.  Marlon Brando in his younger days and still a great actor.  You will see many other well known actors in this movie, like Michael Rennie,  who is absolutely awesome.  I love to watch these movies that I grew up watching.  Thanks Amazon. I love the older movies and this is one of them.  The cast is fantastic and is a very funny movie.  This will be a keeper for any one who loves older movies or loves M. Monroe, R. Calhoun, C. Mitchell or L Bacall.  The case is awesome!!!!! I am a sports fan and baseball fanatic and also happened to be a super fan of Robert Redford's.  If you want to have a great baseball dvd in your collection, this is one to have.  I also suggest Field of Dreams, both are #1 in my collection. If you love Cary Grant, you will LOVE this movie. I saw it many years ago and could not remember the title. Through Amazon, I was able to do some detective work and order this wonderful movie. Have had the movie 2 months and have watched it twice. This is Cary Grant at his very best.  You will not be disappointed in this movie. If I had to rate movie 1 to 10, I would rate this a 20!!!!! The first time I saw this I thought it was a little strange.  When I watched it many years later,  I understood it and it was no longer strange.  It is a great movie-just keep your mind open.  Great cast and storyline. When you watch this great movie, look at all the young actors, before a lot of them became famous.  It is chock full of them.  The remake is good, but this one is better!!! I saw this movie many, many years ago and loved it and wanted to have it for my collection. The only one available was a ""used"" one from someone. It was rated in ""excellent condition"".  Unfortunately, it was not. The movie is great, but the condition was bad. The music garbled and some of the words were slurred. If I had known that, I would not have ordered it.  I will not order ""used"" again. I love Tim Allen.  After seeing the Santa Claus movies for years, I decided to get the collections from Amazon.  Their prices are like no other.  This is a movie that the whole family can watch over and over.  But do not forget the popcorn!!!!!! I have been a fan of Michael Rennie movies since I was 10 (am 65 now).  This mystery movie keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. This would be a great addition to ones DVD library, along with another one of his great movies, The Day the Earth Stood Still (1954), which I also bought from Amazon.  I call Dangerous Crossing a female Mystery flick!  But guys would probably like it to. I have been a fan of Michael Rennie movies since I was 10 (am 65 now).

A2M85JGCPOR97Y," Nice finale to a totally underrated movie series.  This is however an obscure sequel that probably didn't get a lot of distribution.  But it doesn't matter.  It was a great b-movie. Great goodie bag so to speak.  I am not a child of the 80s so I saw this movie in a different light.  A good one.  It was a hilarious little adventure. I loved this movie for a long time.  The sequel was a disappointment.  But I'm not talking about that. This movie had great effects, so much so that you forget it was made in 1996.  I have been waiting for the extended cut to come to blu-ray for a long time.  The regular length just wasn't enough.  And the reviews for the existing blu-rays sounded disappointing. This blu-ray certainly did not disappoint. A+ Very good Blu-ray upgrade. While it did not go through the same restoration process that the MGM Bond films did,  this remaster is still very much a worthy upgrade and well worth the price for any Bond fan. This blu-ray, the 2011 edition, is a very good quality upgrade for fans on this film.  It's a great movie with lots of suspense and plot twists.  Connery was great and suave as ever.  And Zeta-Jones was thrilling and smart. This was  great upgrade for a hilariously immature movie.  I especially like seeing the Alternate movie.  It was more or less ""Anchorman 1.5"".  Plus there was almost an hour of deleted scenes that were in neither version.  So they must have filmed way too much material. I love this series.  Even Alien3 grew on me.  Resurrection...meh...  But I really like the packaging.  The picture and sound quality are superb.  Can't be beat. Crystal clear.  I like that each disc has both versions of the movies...rather than arbitrarily making you watch only one. I've been waiting for them to give a proper remaster treatment to this movie so I could add the BR to my collection.  And this is the one.  Look no further. I love ""The Santa Clause"". I'm not a big big fan of the sequels.  But that's okay.  I wanted them all.  And it was great to see a movie I grew up with in such great quality. Great, crisp upgrade to BR.  I love the packaging. The only complaint I have is...of course ... no unrated Live Free or Die Hard, forcing me to keep my DVD of it. My favorite season of the crazy good show.  This was the first season I saw too.  Then went back and watched the others.  This was the year the show re-invented itself after a year long hiatus because of the 2007 writers' strike.  Loved all the characters, story and action. I may be one of the few people that really liked these movies.  Especially the first AVP.  The actors where almost all unknowns but that doesn't really matter.  The CGI and the action was spectacular.  And the story was really good.  The only thing I have to say about AVP-R is that they should have done some lighting correction.  It was like that in theaters and on DVD.  Those scenes are confusing. I think these films look really great in High Def.  I hated Rambo IV and will likely never watch the BR.  And my complaint against this box set is that there are almost no special features...forcing me to keep my DVDs. Very pleased with this restoration version of a classic film.  I had read reviews for earlier blu-ray editions of this film.  I was not impressed.  But this full restoration finally did it justice. Great, crisp upgrade to BR.  I love the packaging.

I played Back to the Future Games on the playground with my friends. It was very important to me to get this on blu-ray.  And I was not disappointed at all.  They did such a good job upscaling and restoring these movies. A chilling portrayal of a post apocalyptic world. It shows what a person will do to protect who they love. And when such an existence will take away from a person. It was well acted and well produced. A definite A+ Always like Henry Winkler.  This movie was great.  When I discovered it was on Blu-ray I knew I wanted to add it to my collection so I could watch it every year.  The cast is great.  The story is a typical Hallmark Christmas love story...which is what makes it so great. This a well acted chilling adaptation of an unfortunate story.  A child plagued by his own nature and a mother who comes to accept him after it's too late.  Wonderfully acted and filmed. Logan Lerman is perfect as Percy Jackson (or any other part).  This was a really fun movie.  Kids, teens and some adults would love it.  The story and the action where really cool.  and the effects were really well done.  I like how it shows the struggle of friends and family..etc.  A Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig really blew it out of the park with this one.  You really can't just look at the title, with this one, and think ""that sounds stupid"". Because you are missing out on a good sci-fi/action/western here.  And not to mention Noah Ringer (Last Airbender) traded in his airbending skills for a cool knife.  Olivia Wilde was ravishing as usual.  Great film. The story was cool and thrilling. The adventure was captivating. The characters where all very well done. The actors, Joel Courtney, Zach Mills, Elle Fanning, Ryan Lee, Gabe Basso, and Riley Griffiths all did a great job. The writing, acting, directing, and camera work, as well as special effects where all 100% A+ I highly recommend this movie to all. I wouldn't call this a reboot or a remake or any kind.  This is a great new take on the old Planet of the Apes series.  Set in present day.  Great CGI. Great story.  Great acting.  Can't wait for ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"". This show can only be described as hilarious. The main character is supposed to be a jerk. But that's what makes him funny. He thinks the world is his fun place. He says the most outrageous things. And Little Spock (Jacob Kogan) is cool too, he plays Jon's son. Even people in North Ska-kota will like it! Movies with gladiator fighting always mean a lot of cool action. This movie was not exception. It was full of Roman myth and interesting plot line when it came to the fiction part. The acting was superb. As usual Jamie Bell was on top of his game and did not disappoint. Channing Tatum played a good leader fallen from glory. And it was cool to see Donald Sutherland in this movie. I give it top marks. Great compilation of all the HP films.  The first few were only a small step up from the DVD.  But it all looks great.  My only complaint is that the last three have the movies only. I have to be honest...the only reason I saw this movie is because of the phenomenal actor Logan Lerman.  He did great as the fourth musketeer.  Other than that and the effects, this movie was pretty mediocre. This is actually much closer to the source story than the Arnold version.  So if you are upset they didn't go to Mars...it's not because they were unfaithful to the source material...they where actually more faithful. I loved the special effects and the music.  The acting was great.  And Bryan Cranston was a good ""Bad"" guy here. Great movie to round out a trilogy.  I'm an adult and I found this one, and the other two, to be hilarious.  The lead actor (Zachary Gordon) really knows what he's doing...I'm sure he's going great places in the acting world.  If your kids don't think this is funny you might want to first take them to the doctor to see if their funny bone is broken...second take them to a psychiatrist cause your kid might be a sociopath. Disregard all the complaints from the book fans.  This is a great piece of cinema.  You will love every bit of it. Very artfully done.  And Asa Butterfield is a terrific actor with a big future as an actor. This was a great independant movie. You might think it's a stupid concept for a movie . But it is very entertaining.  and it is not at all dizzying like some indy films. I like this set.  It's the movie and some special feature.  Let's call it the essentials.  I bought this rather than waiting for the later release of the Ultimate Edition for a few reasons.  Price.  and it was all I needed.  I'm not a HUGE batman fan so I didn't need every production detail documented...just the essentials. This is great. I thought Nathan Gamble's acting was good as usual.  But other than that it was an awkward, contrived, and stretched thin plot line. There was no real point to it other than you can believe in God and science.  However, most religions condemn large parts of science, so I don't see the point that was trying to be made as anything other than pandering to people who see the church's views as outdated.  D- I really like this movie.  It was intense and there are elements certainly not meant for children to see. I like how the story covers several different ages of love.  I think my favorite person in the movie was Lou played by Logan Lerman.  I just never seem to find a movie where he disappoints. This is a great prequel to the 1938 classic.  I was hoping they wouldn't fudge it up.  And I was right.  It was great.  All the magic and wonder of the original with the modern day FX. This was a great coming of age movie.  Rebellion. Jealousy. Growing up.  Danger. It has it all.  I like seeing Nick Robinson (Melissa & Joey) and Gabriel Basso (Super 8), they are terrific actors.  Terrific movie. A+ This was a decent film about not being over competitive.  I liked seeing Kenton Duty in this movie.  I think he's going to be a good career actor.  But this film was also basically a big ad for Salvation Army. This is a great movie.  It is hilarious and emotionally strong.  I always like a good 'teen builds character and breaks out' movie.  And this one was a really good one.  I will watch it many times.  Liam James was terrific in this role.  And Sam Rockwell was funny and endearing.  A+ This was a pretty good movie with a good lesson.  The bully turning into a good guy.  And people learning to trust unlikely friends.  This is also a good anti-bullying film.  I liked Kenton Duty in this film.  He apparently gained 21lbs in muscle for this movie and then way more afterwards.  That's dedication to the art. The movie was awkward at points but other than that it was good. Confusing and incredibly contrived.  If anyone wants to see Ansel Elgort because they liked him in The Fault In Our Stars...he's just barely in this or the sequels. The special effects are high end.  But that doesn't save the movie from it's confused and desperate plot. I am not usually a horror movie fan, but these movies are an exception.  They are all pretty good with only two exceptions.  Halloween Resurrection and Halloween II (2009).  They really take you on an edge of your seat ride guessing what is going to happen, who is going to die how. Really awesome, long awaited return to this franchise.  I think this movie deserved every bit of it's success.  I can't wait for the sequel.  The story was great, if a little unoriginal.  But still very fun and cool.  The acting was pretty good.  Although, Bryce Dallas Howard, high heels, come on?! Cancel Christmas is a really nice Christmas movie with a nice message and good spirit.  Pretty strong offering from Hallmark. I haven't watched Christmas Magic yet, but I'm sure it's a lot of fun. I loved this re-imagining of a classic.  The CGI was brilliant.  The voice acting was great, with a cast of veterans.  And they followed that up with the new-coming lead Neel Sethi.  He was great.  A lot of natural talent.  The music and the story could not have been better.  Way to go Disney.  Also, this blu-ray was great! Really cool return to the franchise that captivated so many.  Don't know if there will be another....probably at some point.  We'll see if Arnold will participate.  But this one was pretty awesome.  It took a second viewing for me to appreciate.  But that doesn't say anything about the quality.  You may have a hard time following some of it, if you don't watch some to a lot of sci-fi. I'm sorry but this was a pale remake of Star Wars IV: A New Hope.  Planet Killer Base (horrible name)=Bigger Death Star.  Ray=Luke. Jakku=Tattione.  Kylo Renn vs. Han Solo=Vader vs. Obi Wan.  Bad try renaming the empire the first order, same thing. Kylo Renn was a really bad angsty knock off of Darth Vader.  The mask was just to look cool.

AXD0K2A3A2L58," If you're a scifi fan and haven't seen this movie, it's a must.  It has a great story, excellent acting and interesting cinematography.  Besides, you get to see very young Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Darryl Hannah. Being a fan of her stories, I thought this movie was a wonderful adaptation of her novel.  I've seen other films of this story and this one is every bit as good as they were. I liked this movie when it first came out and could not believe it was based on a true story.  It will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. If you've never seen the original with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway you might like this movie because it does have an interesting plot.  The original is a classic period piece with cutting edge cinematography of the time.  The wardrobe alone is worth watching. Great story and great acting.  This is a whimsical romance that covers a lot more territory than love between a man and a woman.  There's a lot about relationships and friendships and family.  This film is one you watch over and over. If you're a scifi fan and haven't seen this movie, it's a must.  It has a great story, excellent acting and interesting cinematography.  Besides, you get to see very young Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Darryl Hannah. If you're a scifi fan and haven't seen this movie, it's a must.  It has a great story, excellent acting and interesting cinematography.  Besides, you get to see very young Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Darryl Hannah. Carl Sagan and Cosmos are one in the same, just plane great.  I got tired of waiting for TV to rerun the original series so I bought my own copy.  There is nothing wrong with the new Cosmos, but I am more comfortable with Carl Sagan's teaching. this movie followed the book very well.  It was very well done and visually interesting with great costumes.  This was the second time I'd seen the movie, and I liked as much as the first time. This movie followed the book very closely, and Tom Cruise did an excellent job of capturing the character of Jack Reacher in spite of his small stature.  In case you haven't read the books, Reacher is well over 6 feet tall and weighs over 200 lb.  I enjoyed the movie and hope they make more of his books into movies. I watch this movie every time it's on TV.  So this time I just broke down and rented it after watching the original REDS.  Lots of fun with a great cast. I think this book was intended for young readers, but I've enjoyed it immensely.  I've read the book at least twice and watched the movie repeatedly.  The movie is an excellent adaptation from the book, so if you don't like to read, you really get most of the story in the movie.  I found the political and social issues a little uncomfortable. Loved the movies in the theater and every time I watch them at home.  Of course, the books were great as well.  However, I think the last movie does at better job of ending the story than the final book does. What a nice surprise to find on Amazon.  This was another, very well done Victorian story worthy of BBC or Masterpiece Theatre.  If you were a afa of Downton Abbey, you'll like this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3E0MATMQQQCFM," Very old great classic. It is very fun to watch again the top movies of the 80s and compare them to top action movies now... quite a difference. Can't help to imagine what our kids would think of special effect of todays movies in 20 years.. they would probably go..WHAT you thought this was great? hahah  Well, something is sure, Chuck Norris will always be Chuck Norris Time to remember the OLD western time. The story line was not the greatest but the fuzzy warm feeling that comes up when you remember you childhood while watching it is priceless! VERY macho John Wayne.. some women might not like... but at the same time, I don't think I had ever seen him this poetic in a movie... that was just great Watching this today still does the same effect as years ago. I have to say the graphics are great considering the year this was made. My little toddler was just glued to it mainly when there were animals of weird special effects... still just a treat Very great moral story.. great heroes are not always the ones with guns and power... But mothers and fathers who toil all day long to provide for their families... On the side, we still need guns and power to protect them you know, for a guy who like movies like x-men, i robot, and all genre of scifi and adventure, this was quite refreshing. Guys, pick this movie for a date night with your wives.. you will like it.. she will adore it and you will score big points :) Good movie. I am getting very good at finding the kind of moves that my wife like... This one definitely hit home for her. She enjoyed it and I was the hero of the night :) first time ever watching series.. First episode realism on everything is quite engaging and very pleasing! I am still not sure about the plot. but let me watch the second episode! Great movie from Belmondo here. Even tho the ending makes sense, I still secretly wanted it to be different. This was also a very good reminder of Childhood memories with the whole family in for a movie night in front of the TV set! This is a movie collection worthy to by owned. I think these movies are some of the best out there. great story line and great acting... Go watch it if you don't believe me... you know, for a guy who like movies like x-men, i robot, and all genre of scifi and adventure, this was quite refreshing. Guys, pick this movie for a date night with your wives.. you will like it.. she will adore it and you will score big points :) Old John Wayne classic. Never gets old. Two war enemies leader becoming friends after war. What a better way to present an american spirit... I hope all Americans would remember this This is a movie collection worthy to by owned. I think these movies are some of the best out there. great story line and great acting... Go watch it if you don't believe me... As I already said Very good movie. Even though the story is not really life like, it tells us how life should be. And I think we all need to watch it and remember that we all have to live. Mainly in this uneasiness that is gripping the nation. Good show. Does not keep me glued to it but it call for great story and good entertainment if you like the genre. Can get VERY EMOTIONAL at each episode's ending.... but who does not need emotions, right? The are what I call slow pace movie.. to wind down your day while making your wife happy that you chose this movie by your lone self.. Slow pace not because it is boring but simply because I like fast action movies... Great time with wife.. she loved it.. The are what I call slow pace movie.. to wind down your day while making your wife happy that you chose this movie by your lone self.. Slow pace not because it is boring but simply because I like fast action movies... Great time with wife.. she loved it.. Very good show bot for children and adults. No swearing on it.. very child friendly. My 18 months would just snuggle with me when we watch this. AS soon as he see the images he start smiling! Very sad movie. but oh how well played and set up. The acting was quite good and the story quite realistic. I think I can apply something that a smart man said: who kills by the sword will die by the sword... or at least a close relative haha I do enjoy this movie a lot. Even tho some agendas were inserted into it that I necessarily do not agree with. The plot was great and the actors were just amazing! Was a good show. It is a little different viewing the story from this point of view. Just a little skeptical on how much of this story line is actually accurate. But nevertheless, it calls for a good show! Very sad movie. but oh how well played and set up. The acting was quite good and the story quite realistic. I think I can apply something that a smart man said: who kills by the sword will die by the sword... or at least a close relative haha I gave it 3 stars just to be fair because I did watch only about 15min of the first one and it did not click with me. SO please, don't take this as an accurate experience. And if you happen to watch it and you get addicted please let me know and I will go watch it again! Thanks! VERY SAD MOVIE. My wife and I had to compromise on4 stars... she wanted me to give 5 and I wanted to give 3. great story.. but am not a fan of Sad stories Mixed feelings about how I feel about this movie. On one part a father who wants to do good by his kids so much that he totally miss their lives... but then again children need structure and discipline.. Well I guess a mixture of both should be... very nice battle scenes. nicely choreographed Story line  not the greatest but I guess I can live with it! Did not like the ending that much. But I guess that would be the life of a murderer.. The thing I like about this show is that people do seems realistically close to real life. The problems are very close to home and I can relate to them. But sometime in the side of entertainment some episode are just a let down... but of well, LIFE is difficult! Ok movie. Did not move me much. Just good to know the background of the woman who wrote novels that I will never let me children read not watch the movies from them. I might be one of the few who think they were pointless! I had already seen this in the theater. I wanted my wife to see. She did and really liked it. I was really happy. That was a good movie night! PS: of course she had a lot of questions given that she has never seen any star trek movie hahaha ok movie. seemed too cliche on too what is happening. but i had to admit that the story line was well intended. could have been a hit is was well founded and directed. I am have to admit I was quite delighted to see how the intensity of the plots grew from previous seasons. And this was the perfect way to end a season and a TV series. Season 5 was not a waste of my time! Nice story, at least in the beginning as I did not see the whole thing. I do like Nic Cages but the story did not stick to me.. I fell very disconnected.. I might come back some other day to finish it. I still have it in my Watch-list I think! One of the best low budget movie I have seen in  long time. I think the acting was just great. The movie gives you all the emotions that contribute to life...Happiness, sadness, anger, hope and others haha good show, or at least my 2 1/2 year son seems to think so. He watched it over and over. the more he watches, the more he asks questions: are they bear or dogs? Is that a tiger? Is that a monkey?..... Ok movie. not my typical sort of movies, but my wife like this sort of things. So I watched it with her (yes, I picked it up myself). If that made my wife happy then I am happy!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A8PW0WUVGYF9P," This has been a favorite movie of mine since its release. It is non-stop action from beginning to end. Harrison Ford is excellent in his role as the President. Gary Oldman is one of the scariest bad guys you'll see in a movie. I enjoy this film every time I watch it. It is well worth the time to watch it. Okay, it is not a great movie, but it is entertaining. I like Ashley Judd, and was surprised by the rest of the cast, which Amazon Prime fails to acknowledge. Besides Judd, and Greg Kinmear, you will find Hugh Jackman, and Marisa Tomei. I was entertained for the full hour and thirty-seven minutes. but the main reason I watched it was because of Robert Mitchum. I always enjoy his movies, and this one is included. It is just a movie to watch and enjoy. If you like war movies, you will love this one. It is gritty, funny, heartwarming, and most important, accurate. The people portrayed are real, and you get to see and hear them during each episode. You will see the sometime political side of war, and perhaps even the blunders. Most of all you will see how competent leadership can overcome obstacles. The bottom line is that you will see the brotherhood of war. How it bonds people for life. You will like this movie, as that seems to be the main point of this movie. Linda Blair is kind of the narrator of the film. The acting is poor, and the script left a lot to be desired. Some action sequences late in the film, and ends with Linda Blair and a machine gun. You would probably be better off spending 90 minutes elsewhere. Another British show that makes something out of nothing. Season one (three episodes) chases a Jack The Ripper copycat. But is also follows the main character as he stumbles through his new position, and his sergeant who resents him. Put it all together, and it makes for a very entertaining evening or evenings. This is supposed to be the last of the Shrek series.  It is just as funny as the previous Shrek movies. It has been a great series, and I will miss it, except I have copies of all of them, and will have my own private Shrekfest when I feel like it. The ""Joe"" force is wiped out - or so Cobra thinks. But three ""Joes"" survive, and take the battle to Cobra. Not everyone is who that are supposed to be, and supposed good guys are really the bad guys. The movie is non-stop action. ""The Rock"" has found a vehicle that suits him to a ""T"". It is just an entertaining movie. I knew they used General Patton, and this type of program to fool the Germans into thinking D-day was coming to the wrong spot. This left most of the landing zone undermanned. What I didn't know what how widespread this deception was during the war. This documentary examines the group that developed and produced these deceptions. It is a story very recently released by the government, due to cold war fears. Well worth watching. The movie takes a fresh look at the beginnings of the man of steel. It also puts a slightly different spin on Zod, and his exile and ultimate ""search"" for the Krypton child. It is also interesting to note the paranoia that grips the U.S. when the man of steel surfaces. I rated the movie 4 stars because it is entertaining and enjoyable. It will keep you interested for the entire 2+ hours. If you like war movies, you will love this one. It is gritty, funny, heartwarming, and most important, accurate.

A26W3R1WMJBWDF," Nice and twisty, you sort of know where it is going and it does, but does so in a way that keeps your attention. I've watched it twice and enjoyed it both times. We've seen this movie a couple of times now, it is good enough to stay in our collection of DVD's. Kevin Spacey is the twisty one here and at the end.........well it is very good. We watched it twice, it was a total action movie, front to back. Great cast and nothing looked ""fakey""..........Jon Voigt was just sooooo easy to hate, LOL (perfect). Gene Hackman with the old man clothes and dorky glasses...........great. Overall, I think I'll eventually buy a copy of this one. The history part was great, but maybe a bit too many ""celebs"" talking for a bit too long........... It did definitely add to my knowledge of the city and how it grew to be what it is today. I understand where the film maker was going, but too choppy and disconnected for me to really like. Watched about half and that was enough to see the ideas and creation of the projects...............eh, it was okay We've seen this movie a couple of times now, it is good enough to stay in our collection of DVD's. Kevin Spacey is the twisty one here and at the end.........well it is very good. Masterpiece is always well done, good actors etc. The story itself was a tiny bit odd to me and you just didn't ""get it"" until near the end. I decided not to watch it again knowing the end. But I did like it, no question of turning it off came up. Whitechapel will hopefully continue, it is getting better as it goes, season 2 is good, season 3 even better than that. My kind of story lines, always connected to historical murders...........yessss. Hope Amazon will continue to supply it to the Prime purchasers. I read some early reviews that didn't like this one as well as the others, I found it just fine..........a good action adventure set in old London and Downey is great as Sherlock. The story jumps about a bit too much, but it is good. LeCarre writes large convoluted books and translating them to a movie takes a lot of talent. The tone of the movie is sort of low key, but the events continue all through it. This one is riveting from start to finish........just enough twists and turns to not allow you to guess what comes next. Lots of memorable characters and one you could just kick......... a great movie, that's why I bought it. I don't know if it is historically totally correct, but a great movie. Lots of insight into the different cultures and ways of dealing with them, both American and Japanese. A movie that was better than it's ratings. Now this one taught me a lot, I liked it all and immediately went out and bought a new Sriracha, fresh off the line in the new factory. Very good video, well shot, interesting history and current. A good story, but a bit slowish..........It did the usual twists and turns and only shortly before the end did I figure out ""whodunit""............and was right on the money. Characters are not as dynamic as they could be, hopefully it will get better as the season progresses. If this program continued and was offered by Amazon, I'd watch it. Good characters, gives plenty of hints and clues and didn't drag on like some other programs. I was happy watching it and was sorry to reach the end of the season. I liked the story of it, got really really hungry and miss having a deli, a REAL deli nearby. OMG, the size of the sammiches was amazing at most of the places. Makes me want to visit New York and go on a tasting spree. This was sort of a surprise to me, I did not think a story about chess would be interesting enough to keep me watching to the end. Pleasantly surprise to find it informative about life, politics, aims.... It was well paced and active (more than I expected to be truthful). This is the third season I've viewed and it continues to be interesting. There might be a slight problem with audio, but it is not too distracting and won't keep me from continuing to enjoy this program. Fourth season continues to be as good as earlier ones. Even hubby sits in sometimes when it looks interesting to him, but I am the one who is dedicated to forensic science and I love this program. Good program, but after so many seasons I am a bit weary of the voice over guy. Content continues to be great, some are ""best of"" programs, repeats, but still interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3T3SICKHZACWU," This concert is amazing. The Band is amazing and the guests are amazing ending with the best performances of all. This is a great production by a great producer as well. Buy it for you will not be disappointed. A Christmas Classic This really funny and entertaining movie has become a Christmas classis. Leave it to John Hughes to leave us with this smarty kid and the two bungling burglers in interaction with each other. One to dig out each Christmas with the other movies that have earned the Classic title. A Great Who Done It or Who Done What. Great movie which has many twists and leaves the viewer bewildered and loving every minute of it. Liam Neeson is great as the good guy who you are unsure of but not really or are you?...the new type of Harrison Ford character and movie. Great thriller. A great spy movie with excellent cast and acting. The impressive photography itself paints pictures throughout the movie which reflects the content. However, it can be hard to follow just as the book tends to be. Yet this keeps the viewer on his toes and trying to figure it out. Good one for subtitles and to watch a second time. Gary Oldman is especially good with his facial expressions and character revelations through the movie. This was a feel good movie which may have skipped some realism to achieve that. However, my wife and I enjoyed it as it seemed to reflect older movies of the 50s and the 60s. It made us feel good about our country and what values we had during the World War II. This is a wonderful movie with a great story line and great acting. Judi Dench is always the person she plays just as she is Philomena. The interactions within the relationship between the two main characters is interesting as it changes and becomes deeper. Philomena's character gives a freshness to acceptance and forgiveness. Good movie for getting the idea of the sailboat in all of kinds of bad luck, but a bit dry. I realized how important the land is to me after this movie. A satisfying movie for the historical content and look into the past US presidents. Good acting from the two main characters as they struggle with life at home and the outside influences of the 60s. This was a very good movie but not a great movie. However, it gave me a clear understanding what is like to be owned by another person. How horrible that would be under the best of circumstances. Great directing and acting. Of all of those who backpack the Pacific Rim Trail or other great trails in this country or the world, I think there are hundreds more who are more interesting or adventurous than the main character in this story. It is a shame one of them did not write a book and have it picked up by Hollywood. Rather than ""Wild"" I think ""Boring"" would have been a more apt title. What a dumb movie.

A2J6K00TXTZWJQ," Somehow I missed this movie when it was new. I love Julia Roberts so when I saw it I had to watch. It's pretty good, though old. Definitely a chick flick. It's worth your time on an afternoon when there's nothing on the tv to watch. This movie has some heavy hitters in it; Paul Newman, Jessica Tandy, Melanie Griffith, Bruce Willis come to mind. I really enjoyed it a lot. It's not a fast paced action movie, it's about life in a small town and how their lives intermingled and choices they've made in life. I don't know how I missed this one for so long as it was made in the 90's. I think it's worth a watch and I'm glad I did. Sally Field did a great acting job in this movie, goes to show you don't mess with mama bear with cubs! She takes matters into her own hands and will entertain you with this movie. I am 40+ years old and just got around to watching this movie, it was pretty interesting right up until the end. The very end leaves you wondering, what does that mean?!? The ending frustrated me quite a bit, but otherwise, I am glad I watched this classic so I can say I have seen it ( years later). Don't know how I missed this one, I thought I'd seen all of McConaughey's movies. This one is very different that all his others I've seen. Has some great actors in it and is a drama/action yet funny at the same time. It's a good movie, try it. You'll like it! Hillary Swank does an amazing job in playing this role. I understand this movie is based on a true story, however...it is kind of messed up and shocking to me. And the ending...let's just say a not very happy ending. My husband says I am banned from picking the movies for awhile after watching this one! And I don't blame him! ) : This really could not have been much more bizarre. It was so strange I kept watching to the end to see what happened. There are more than a few sexual scenes, just be warned if this offends you. I can't say I enjoyed the movie, would not recommend. I generally like Nicole Kidman movies and this is another good one. Renee Zellweger plays a supporting role and knocks her role out of the park!  If you haven't seen this, watch it! It's worth your time. It is part historical, part western with some action and lots of drama. I didn't know the main actors in this movie but took a chance and so glad I did. Lots of action and well made. I really enjoyed this movie, it will entertain you. It says it is based on a true story so I watched it. It was okay but not a movie I would want to watch again. It seems that once you've watched a Vietnam war movie, you've seen them all. I thought it would be a sequel to the original Stargate with Kurt Russell etc. What a disappointment! LAME lame lame. I turned it off after the first 10 minutes or so. Don't waste your time. This is a grade B movie. It says it is based on a true story so I watched it.

Cute movie. The beginning of the movie is edge of your seat thrilling & amazing,  then changes to a slower drama. The first time I watched it it was sort of disconcerting because of the huge pace change, the second time I watched it I more appreciated the drama. Worth watching for sure. I am definitely not a Tom Cruise fan,but I have to give him credit for this action pic! Loved it! Lots of action and adventure. Great movie! I have watched it twice now. It made me laugh, but know this is a crude movie with some endearing qualities. It is typical of Jackass shows, raunchy at times, vulgar occasionally and many times tasteless. But funny! It starts out a bit interesting, then lags along with enough ""what's going to happen next"" to keep you going, then the ending comes and you say ""What??!! What does that mean??!!"" Don't waste your time. It had some good actors in the movie but it just sorta dragged along....I kept watching thinking something has to give. Then the end of the movie is so depressing! I was sorry I had watched it and wasted my time! Don't bother with this movie!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2PX6U3D6VW6CY," With the exception of the plot kind of changing mid movie, which sort of threw me off;  I still think it was a pretty good diamond in the rough.  You have to watch the entire movie to really understand the complete scenario. Since she was in the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding, I have fallen in love with Nia Vardalos.  This movie was such a refreshing surprise, as I found it by accident.  Definitely a diamond in the rough. I think those who created this movie thought they were doing clips for America's Funniest Videos.  I'm an avid horror fan, and this has nothing to do about horror, but rather humor.  Waste of time !!! This is one of the best Robert De Niro movies I've ever seen.  Really makes you think about family, and enough we are children that grow up to be adults, we have to remember our parents are getting older too.  Great movie !!!!!! This movie is about friendship and what you would do for each other if times turned worse.  One of the best movies I've ever seen.  Both Sarandon and Davis, as well as the other cast, were excellent in this movie.  Plus you get to see Brad Pitt in one of his first roles !!  Definitely a must see !! This movie is very well done.  I'm unfortunate that things like this happen today, but unfortunately some things will never go away and ALL want to put an end to it. It's a very artsy type horror move, but I dug it!  6 different mini movies rolled into one.  It won't be at the top of everyone's list, but just my opinion. Clueless father.  Keen mother.  And a horrible child / teenager.  It was okay, I almost gave it 2 stars.  I just wish the plot had been a little better.  Acting was probably the only thing on par. Very well done.  It takes you on a chase where your not sure if it's a dream by the main character, or real life.  I really enjoyed this movie and I think you will too ... I kept seeing the previews for this movie, and couldn't wait to see it!  It was a lot different than what I thought it would be, but in a good way!  I was definitely on the edge of my seat the entire time! I'm not sure what movie so of these people watched, and don't get me wrong, I like a good independent movie as well as a mainstream, but this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life!  Complete waste of time, not to mention money I spent renting it. Having worked in the airline industry for many years with a major carrier, I can honestly say that most of this is BS.  Most pilots would not do that for their flight attendant, they would just throw them to the wolves to save themselves.  However, the film as far as all other aspects, is excellent. I kept seeing the previews for this movie, and couldn't wait to see it!  It was a lot different than what I thought it would be, but in a good way!  I was definitely on the edge of my seat the entire time! I'm all for a different kind of movie, as long as there is some decent plot or meaning behind it.  Having said that, this was probably one of the type of movies that I couldn't wrap my mind around.  It just didn't make any sense from the beginning to the end.  If you like artsy type movies without meaning, then this is for you!  But I still stick with movies that have a real PLOT !! One of the best werewolf movies I have seen in a very long time!  This movie is definitely full of action and will keep you on the edge of your seat once it gets going ... It takes a little bit for the movie to get going, but once it did, I really enjoyed how it played out.  Keeping in mind, it's a very artsy movie, but I appreciate how it was done. If you enjoy a creepy thriller type movie, then this is the one for you!  Great acting as well as a great plot !!  Very glad I ended up renting this !!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATK1PI2HWROER," Missed it at the movies.  Now with PRIME how easy.  Good action flick, a little predictable but enough to make you guess a little.  Great action sequences.  RECOMMENDED for the action flick people. Very very fine older war movie.  Great cast and production.  Shows many of the things the United States did wrong at Pearl Harbor.  Worth a watch or purchase it and use it in your classrom.  Well done.  RECOMMEMDED If somehow you missed this one....HOW?  All the stars, all the action, all the history.  This is based on true events and is a great action movie.  Buy it and sit back and enjoy, an oldie but really goodie.  RECOMMENDED A movie with Kevin Dillon, Ethan Hawke, Gary Sinise, Peter Berg, and more recognizable characters before they were big stars?  Yes, and worth the watch.  This 1992 flick A MIDNIGHT CLEAR got some critical acclaim and is well worth your time.  I found it searching war movies but is it?  Certainly a drama about war but this one is so much more..  A pretty serious drama and fun to watch these young actors.  RECOMMENDED A great Mini-series.  Incredibly filmed, so realistic and with very very fine acting and great character development.  Just look at the reviews, no need to beat a dead horse.  Thanks to PRIME for letting me enjoy this.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I didn't read the book but the movie, HART'S WAR was sure a pleasant surprise and thanks to PRIME it was free to me.  The movie is a World War II movie but it is a concentration camp movie as well and a courtroom drama and a mystery.  The cast was good and the pace was good too.  THREE AND A HALF STARS This was the only one of the trilogy that I saw at the movies and now got the extended version.  It was better.  And I have ti mention how gorgeously it was filmed.  Great tale and an excellent movie.  The second and third movies are on their way to me.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED You can't really go far wrong getting this movie with supporting cast, that alone will keep the movie stable and of course, Sandra Bullock, as always great.  The movie is actually a serious subject and its done, not perfect but pretty well.  Addiction is tough to handle for everyone and it comes across here, maybe a little too lightly but it works.  Nice movie. Near perfect comes to mind.  I saw the first movie in the trilogy in the theatre and then re-watched it, then got this CD to see THE TWO TOWERS.  One Great follow-up movie.  The story is rich, the effects awesome and the characters believable in their roles.  I am on to the third movie and looking forward to it.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED You just have to read the reviews here, or really anywhere, THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRIOLOGY is simply put one of the best movie trilogies, EVER.  THE RETURN OF THE KING is the third movie and is just as good as the other two.  Simply outstanding cinema.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Four thousand five star reviews says a lot.  BAND OF BROTHERS should be on every bodies must see list.  One of the best war movies ever mad and probably one of the best TV series ever done.  Unbelievable special effects, acting, realism, production....you name it this show has it and better than most.  Whether you are in to war movies or not this is amazing.  Watch it.  So HIGHLY RECOMMENDED This is one truly unique series. Original. Fun. Serious. Well acted with a great cast. Done with humor, funny and dark.  Outstanding television.  Run out and buy it and enjoy.  RECOMMENDED wish there were more than five stars. Get GETTYSBURG it is soo much better.  Too long and too long because of non-historic mush.  The picture couldn't figure out if it was a war flick or a multiple-love story.  Disappointing I loved the first season.  This second season is a small step down.  It is probably because no one ever, EVER, is very happy.  Great cast and great acting but slow probably because death is a tough subject, yet there are a lot more seasons to go.  I want to watch them and will but I am hoping for a little more kaboom.  This is a very good series  I recommend it .  RECOMMENDED Of course I am a trekkie guy.  Fan.  But season two of Voyager is, well, dull.  Seems to me the creators are struggling to get a handle on what the season/series is about.  Everything is new in Delta but we should expect more.  Will of course go on to season three OK, ok, this is a lot of profanity and violence, deal with it.  THE WIRE is a one great TV show.  Set in Baltimore it deals realistically with the drug problems in major cities and the problems with combating it.  The cast is mostly unknown actors and I think this helps with the realism.  The acting is very good.  ON PRIME, the series is free, start today.  Very HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Thius is one of the best series ever.  We get to follow a rising Hollywood star and his entourage through the ups and downs of the business.  It is well worth your time and money to get this one and go on to the the other seasons.  Great Comedy.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED You have to watch this series...all the Emmy nominations scream...watch.  Now I said season two was a step down because every one was so sad.  Well, its worse but, the quality of the shows make it all ok.  Now if you are looking for happiness, THIS AIN'T IT.  Good TV , yes.  Lauren Ambrose gets better and better....and if you are a fan, Frances Conroy...god she is believable as the most miserable person I have ever seen.  GREAT TV Scott Bakula's try at the Enterprise.  Not bad, not great, lots of the same ole things.  If you are a STAR TREK fan you pretty much love it, if not, you probably won't try.  I wanted to love it but it just misses.  The series is free on PRIME so how bad can it hurt, on to season 2 I am over being depressed watching these soo depressed people.  It is what it is.  A great series about horrible stuff and depressing people.  Congrats to Alan Ball, the creator.  Brenda Chenowith , Rachel Griffiths,  is soo complex and twisted.  Not happy TV, great TV  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED If you are reading this, you should have watched the four previous....so....still great....still sad and twisted.  The last seven mins or so is the best series ending I have ever seen  !!  GREAT SERIES  So well wrapped up.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED It is what it is.  Grand style action and special effects.  The Rock is either funny or a super hero in his movies and does a good job in them.  I enjoyed the movie but you get what you should from these movies. I LOVE THE SERIES.  BUT....comparing season 3 to seasons 1 & 2, it comes up a little short.  Still great but not as good as  I am also worried about season 4 that is supposed to be about politics and the school system of Baltimore....with politics being the worst thing in this series in the first three season.  Join PRIME and watch this series or buy it, it is outstanding.  Very HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I tried to get into this series.  I watched it all  and it was like a roller coaster.  Just when I thought it might be quirky and good it would drop to silly and bad.  Anyway, if you never saw it you haven't missed much ....decent cast with sad material that never caught on and was explained away in the last episode...un satisfactorily.  Weak. SEASON 5 as with all the five seasons of THE WIRE is simply put the best TV can offer.  For you FREE on PRIME.  Season 5 brings it all together the five seasons and winds it up better than most season enders, but again, this is THE WIRE, cop show excellence.  The cast, the writing and the continuing storyline are so good.  Get on the ball, watch this one.  MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED I tried to get into this series.

Anyway, if you never saw it you haven't missed much ....decent cast with sad material that never caught on and was explained away in the last episode...un satisfactorily.  Weak.

Season 5 brings it all together the five seasons and winds it up better than most season enders, but again, this is THE WIRE, cop show excellence.  The cast, the writing and the continuing storyline are so good.  Get on the ball, watch this one.  MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED CALIFORNICATION now season two is still differnt and refreshing.  It is a wild sexy romp.  I'ts more of the same for the hapless writer.  I have never been a big Ducovney fan but he and the rest of the cast are great in this serries.  RECOMMENDED Season 3 was a step down from season one and two but still far superior to most shows.  This history of Henry the VIII is well worth a watch, good acting, great sets, and scenery and costumes and the history.  We get more wives and the series gets a little bogged down with the death of Anne, but still vey very good.  RECOMMENDED, series and season. The cost made it a bargain and I thought the video was not terrible but the narration was poor and the information was almost at water fall level....too much too quick.  The students had a hard time following the causes. For an adult or history buff it comes across better. DEFIANCE is a well worth watching historic drama.  Very well acted and the drama does a good job showing the sorrow and hardships endured.  Probably a historic drama you are unaware of until now.  Thank you , PRIME for this frrebie. THE SOLOIST is a very good movie, and the performances of Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx if possible are better than the movie.  I don't know how I missed it first run but I was sure glad to watch it on DVD.  This is one worth seeing, journalist helps homeless musician. I seldom go this low in stars....But HOWL...just read a book on Ginsberg.  This is a slllooow moving artsy film  I like a movie that entertains and ..keeps me awake.  It really doesn't even do Allen Ginsberg justice.  Just a weak film all the way. My god, this season is sooo  slow.  After season one this one is not so hot.  Call it life on a farm and search for Sophia.. endlessly.  Hard to be excited about the next episode.  But on to three, MUST get better Hiuge fan...until this third season.  Far and away the worst of the three.  Good cast and good guests weakened at the wrting level I guess.  I will watch season four but this was way below the other two seasons The first season was soo much better.  Good thing it is a series or you might stop watching.  This season with Thompson losing his grip, well, not as good.  And way too much time with whiney Margaret Schroeder, I used toi like her.  I sure hope season Three goes back to be like season one. Thanks Prime for offering this great regular TV show, for free.  One great cop drama.  Great cast and with the show being about generations in NYPD  there is more than just the routine stories.  Very well done.  RECOMMENDED VEEP SEASON 1 is great comedy.  Get past the cursing and the skewering of the government and get into this series. It is not only a very good Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the other actors are fabulous and so so funny.  A great series, can't wait to watch season 2.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED I said in my review of season one, it was action, action, action and sex.  Well, more of the same.  This is one excellent shoot'em up and if you have PRIME, season one and two are free.  Scott and Stonebridge, the heros are better than Rambo.  British agents worth watching.  If you are into action and not offended by occasional nudity and sex, this is your series.  RECOMMENDED Was gifted season1 of HOUSE OF CARDS with Kevin Space and Robin Wright.  What a team.  What a show.  Think poiliticians are bad guys....watch this series toi confirm your thoughts.  Great TV however.  Good series.  Can not wait for season 2  Someone want to give it to me, lol. Season Three of THE GAME OF THRONES is the best yet.  This series is so unpredictible, so amazing in the story line shockers.  You never know here...at least I don't.  If you read the books then maybe this shockers aren't so shocking.  Love the acting and the way the producers shift from one storyline and character to another.  It is seamless.  This is simply must see television/series.  HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION Maybe the best cop drama ever on regular TV and thanks to PRIME you and I can catch up.  Great cast, good stories, and great family dynamics in this family of law enforcement.  Another great season.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDi What a disappointment.  The tough task of rebuilding Japan at the end of the war drew me to the movie but it was little more that an love story.  Acting was weak and Tommy Lee Jones was just wasted in this historically inaccurate tale.  Watch something else. Maybe Michael Douglas should have won awards with this performance.  BEHIND THE CANDELABRA is worth seeing just for his performance.  The movie itself, and I know nothing about Liberace, was ok, well, better than that but predictible.  Can life be predictible?  You get a good look into the man and the entertainer and his opulence. Season Four...of course, if you are this far...you are an addict like me.  Can't get enough  And the season will just make that that much more solid to you.  Great season !  This is a premier series for any TV and this season has great acting, great multiple story lines and of cousr, deaths of people you least expect to go  Brilliant.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BOARDWALK EMPIRE remains one of the finest series you could pick out to enjoy.  If you haven't watched, back up and start from the beginning.  If you are a regular viewer, you are already hooked.  Season Four is as good or better than the others.  The acting and sets and costumes are amazing.  On to season five.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDi Great ending to the series.  YOU MUST SEE THE FIRST THREE SEASONS, you cant start here.  Much unlike some earlier reviews...on PRIME the entire four seasons are free.  Can not beat that.  The producers and directors do a great job winding up the series in five episodes.  SEldom does a series take care of the loose string.  Kudos.  Series and season  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED This movie was a good view.  Dillion and Dafoe were very good, as was the rest of the cast.  This movie was dark and bloody But there was nothing great about it.  Well worth a free view on PRIME. Terrible language, lesbians, nudity, crime and corruption, drugs, irreverant humor...racism, now all that out of the way and stay away if my list (I am sure there is more I could add) bothers you.  Jenji Kohan, remember WEEDS , has another great great series.  Tremendous cast and creativity.  Original ideas brought to the small screen.  Can't say enough.  Watch and find out about federal prison life.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED One of the better series out there, espercially if you are in to political intrigue.  I hasten to add, that if the show reflects anything close to half truths even, shame on our politicians.  Good series however, more thought provoking in this second season  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED STINK-O.  What waste of Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman, not to say your time.  Terrible terrible movie.  Ok, some kool special effects, but who wrote the dialogue, jeez.  Bad.  Pick another movie STINK-O.  What waste of Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman, not to say your time.  Terrible terrible movie.  Ok, some kool special effects, but who wrote the dialogue, jeez.  Bad.  Pick another movie If you are reading this...you should already be into the series and you KNOW you will watch this season and any to follow.  Ths season...5... is my favorite so far.  Great season and series.  Is there peace in safety?? Three and a half stars....by far my least favorite season.  And the last episode, the sniffling Rick ?  Jeez.  And the very last scene to get you back next season, too much.  This sixth season was just not as good,  It was winey and slow and maybe it's time to hit the road again.  I have a bad feeling about seaon seven, and I am a big series fan.  Hoping for better. Four thousand five star reviews says a lot.  BAND OF BROTHERS should be on every bodies must see list.  One of the best war movies ever mad and probably one of the best TV series ever done.  Unbelievable special effects, acting, realism, production....you name it this show has it and better than most.  Whether you are in to war movies or not this is amazing.  Watch it.  So HIGHLY RECOMMENDED You just have to read the reviews here, or really anywhere, THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRIOLOGY is simply put one of the best movie trilogies, EVER.  THE RETURN OF THE KING is the third movie and is just as good as the other two.  Simply outstanding cinema.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED LOVE & MERCY could have ...should have beedn good.  The material is there.  The directing ans scripting...not so much.  Especially the more modern jump aheads.  Learned more from facts-screens at the end of the movie.  Could have  Should have I have NOT read the book.  That said, dang this series is good.  Any fan of THE VIKINGS or action shows or solid historic shows will enjoy this one.  Can't wait for the next season. You just have to read the reviews here, or really anywhere, THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRIOLOGY is simply put one of the best movie trilogies, EVER.  THE RETURN OF THE KING is the third movie and is just as good as the other two.  Simply outstanding cinema.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2X2FD6YEV5PLW," I had not seen this movie in quite some time.  A great performance by Harrison Ford and the villain is one that is hard to forget.  I enjoyed watching this movie again. The family really enjoyed this HD download.  The video quality was excellent and the movie is a cute addition to the ""Shrek"" franchise.  Only complaint is that the download for instant viewing took longer than we had expected compared to other downloads we have recently viewed. A really fun movie.  Sometimes by the time you get to a third installment the quality just goes downhill.  I don't feel that happened with this series.  It has an interesting plot and some great one liners! This movie pleased the whole family!  It has great voice acting, an interesting plot and great animation.  What an idea to take the standard holiday and fairytale characters and mash them up into an evil fighting team.  In the end, there were even some 'tearjerker' moments.  Definitely worth the time to see! Dexter continues to stun me!  This season seems to be taking a different turn focusing on the relationship between Deb and Dexter, in the wake of last season's finale.  The plot, thus far, has been interesting and I am excited to see where it goes despite a lack of a well defined villain in the early part of the the season.  I am sure, however, it won't disappoint! I had really been looking forward to seeing this movie.  I am always impressed with Denzel Washington's performances.  This one didn't fail to impress.  It is not the feel good movie of the year, but it is a riveting story with excellent acting.  Definitely worth watching! We watched this for a family movie night at our house (with a 3 and 8 year old).  The whole family enjoyed the movie.  It was unlike any other futuristic space movie we had seen before.  It was thought provoking, well acted and had twists in the plot that kept you guessing.  I definitely recommend this movie. Bruckheimer did a good job of mixing action with the Lone Ranger story.  Johnny Depp's performance was awesome and the action level isn't too much for the whole family to enjoy it.  It was a great family movie night choice! Being a person who works in the tech industry I really enjoyed this look at the industry.  It poked fun appropriately, was a fun story and had some good messages.  I good comedy. A good family movie!  There were a lot of funny parts without anything that was inappropriate for little kids.  In the end there is a good message.  A very enjoyable movie. Being a computer scientist, I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for quite some time. The movie did not disappoint.  The acting was excellent and the story was fascinating.  Definitely recommend seeing the movie. Another great movie from Aardman.  I watched this with my 5 and 10 year old sons and we all loved it.  The music in it is cute and it is a fun story line.  There are several scenes that had us laughing so hard we were nearly crying.  So, definitely a movie I can recommend. Forgot how funny this movie was.  Michael Jordan actually does a pretty good job of acting and it is a fun story. It was fun to watch the movie again with my kids. The family enjoyed this movie.  Portions of it were hard for my 5 and 10 year olds to follow which I was a little surprised by.  In the end they were able to follow the whole movie.  It was a very interesting story that was told well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2SQJPUCZNHMZE," A delightful, brilliant and charming film! Pixar has created an amazing story that grabs the attention of children immediately and keeps them entertained throughout.

We love Disney and we love anything nature, and this film was absolutely breathtaking & entertaining. The images are stunning as you learn about wild-life, and my daughter and I have watched this one over-and-over, without ever getting bored. This is a great family film, especially for animal & nature lovers. Exciting, intriguing, entertaining, and educational. Highly recommended! I enjoy most animated movies, especially with colorful characters, and an exciting story. The introduction of a cat and a child, bad guys and the police, and who's running for their lives, or who is being chased. There's plenty of excitement with a theme of good-verses-bad. Fun-filled, Enjoyable, and Entertaining. Highly Recommended! You don't have to be from that that era to Enjoy this delightful presentation of fun with 'Good Music.' The cast are worth the viewing, Sound Effects are Awesome and one that many would find Totally Entertaining. Worth the wait and the price. Highly Recommended!

Fun-filled and Enjoyable for children and for plain old family gatherings. Laugh-out-loud scenes, Adorable characters that pop off the screen with Excellent sound effect. Highly Entertaining and Highly Recommended! If you are a big horror fan, this one aims to please! The story-line is good and Special Effects. Spine-tingling, edge-of-your-seat thrills with good cast.

Ideal movie for thriller and horror lovers. This one will promise to send many chills up your spine. Acting Performance Superb, Scary setting will fright anyone. Intense Suspense that will knock your socks off. Highly Recommended for Horror Lovers. This one aims to please! Disney's Amazing Pocahontas is one of my Favorite characters. The stories portray love, courage, and hope. Each presentation of Pocahontas is a Musical Masterpiece in itself, she's a character children adore and love, because she teaches good things and helps others. There is vibrant animation with Voice expertise with entertaining music. This is magical, charming, delightful, and enchanting for the entire family. Very Enjoyable And Highly Recommended!

Scenery is Excellent, Good story and will strike the fancy of all horror lovers. Highly Recommended! A very Enjoyable comedy about family bonding, relationships and more. The acting performance is Superb. Jason Segel and Susan Sarandon at their best! The story has funny moments and heartfelt moments. But, there's never a dull moment from start to finish, inspiring and touching. Highly Recommended! I have always loved anything Hitchcock mysteries, which many stories have started out slow, just like in this movie. But sometimes, that may be done on purpose to gradually build up the suspense, until it becomes intense. The story is intriguing from start to finish, has a Great cast, and a good ending. Throughout the movie, it has many twists-and-turns to hold your interest, which it did for me. Highly Recommended for mystery lovers who enjoy lots of Suspense! A young woman is dumped by her soul-mate, just before her wedding day. Lola experiences the trauma of heartbreak, her age, and where her life is heading. After taking the advice from friends and family, she decides to venture out on her own healing journey. Emotional, intriguing, and entertaining throughout. Acting Performance Good, and a Great summer movie. Highly Recommended! A six year old child, beasts, and the portrayal of a Fine Line between Fantasy And Reality!

A20ZUNN7AOG5MQ," DVD edition. A wild ride from start to finish.  Don't you wish your thirty round magazine held so much ammo or your heroes had such integrity and ability?  An exciting fantasy adventure and not just for the first watch. Imagine your high school decides to put on a play written, directed and starring fellow students.  And, we are ready for the camera. Fakey hillbilly talk and and really naive characters flourish. But, the color, focus, and sound on the DVD are more than adequate.  Not the sort of thing you are going to wish to watch again and again, but it is still an entertaining performance by a Hollywood legend.  And...the singing is kept to a minimum. Irregardless of the actual animation, the corporation releasing this video chose to do so in Extended Play!!!!  It is not a good policy for a company to shave a few cents from their product at the expense of picture quality. Terrific music!!  Really interesting animation--not the stuff on the box!!!  Fine story.  However, the producers of this video elected to sell it in SLP rather than SP, probably to save a few pennies.  Ergo, if you are looking for a high quality picture, you will not find it in this product! DVD.  Action, adventure, romance sort of  Okay, the pirates are a bit fakey and there is one moderately bad word, but here is a great movie to watch with the kids and enjoy.  Lee Falk would have enjoyed.  The old vehicles were especially interesting. A good version of the Ghost Who Walks. If you can imagine that Steve McQueen was ever a teenager, then ""The Blob"" is a great movie?  Everyday when I am on the treadmill at the YMCA and there is two hundred channels of nothing, I would rather be watching ""The Blob.""  Good entertainment that is not disgusting.  If you have never seen ""The Blob,"" watch it today. Everyone else seems to be spilling the plot beans.  An amazingly funny horror movie, with Betty White just as whacked as can be.  Also, a greatly sarcastic cast.  Special effects are much better than average and the picture quality is just fine. Though it apparently never made the big time, this is still a great fun video. Oh, man, we had to rewind this beauty halfway through and watch Sherlock Holmes in ""The Voice of Terror"" instead.  The backgrounds were nice, the animation terrific... for Saturday morning TV.  If you want more than that, rent it or check it out from the library first before making the purchase. Other a bit of 40s racial humor, this film is a rollicking murder mystery.  Suit prices have really gone up.  And, maybe the director meant dressed to be killed No t-shirts in this film! Don't miss this one. Okay! The original prints are not quite perfect.  Who cares!  Look for the first twenty-four episodes uncut in black and white-thank goodness! plus ""The Unknown People"" two parter from the cinema release that no one I know remembers being at the theater.  Lots of extras.  Thankfully, the DVDs are one sided!  A quality production that plays perfect on my DVD player.  Hopefully, season two is in the works.  Category: Must buy! Classic apocalypse film.  Solid story and film quality, kicking off a long list of sequels.  Yeah, I know the finale was not unexpected to anyone has read science fiction, but what are you going to do?  Worth more than one viewing. You could have seen the chickens coming, but, who would have thought Groucho Marx would show up?  After being dragged to vampire movies, Tony Randall's performance was a welcome watch.  Spoofs Madison Avenue... After making it to a private washroom, Hunter gives it all up for a chicken farm. Tony Randall plays Tony Randall, really.  The video might be part corn, but it is good for a laugh.  Happy viewing. Usually, the sequel is a bit of a letdown.  However, this is the exception to the rule.  A bit too gross to be a family feature, both videos are hysterical, after the kids are asleep.  The only thing I do not understand is why gorgeous women fall for old coots who are not even rich.  Hey, one of them even drove the same vehicle I bought for $125 before you were born Enjoy and go, Catfish Hunter! You could have seen the chickens coming, but, who would have thought Groucho Marx would show up?  After being dragged to vampire movies, Tony Randall's performance was a welcome watch.  Spoofs Madison Avenue... After making it to a private washroom, Hunter gives it all up for a chicken farm. Tony Randall plays Tony Randall, really.  The video might be part corn, but it is good for a laugh.  Happy viewing. You could have seen the chickens coming, but, who would have thought Groucho Marx would show up?

Tony Randall plays Tony Randall, really.  The video might be part corn, but it is good for a laugh.  Happy viewing. ""The Absent-minded Professor"" is an hilarious b&W comedy classic.  However, ""Son of Flubber"" is a, you know, sequel.  Sequels rarely live up to their originals.  However, SOF is still better than almost anything produced on video today. Together the two are a bargain. So, what are you waiting for?  Buy this disc today. The CG shorts are technically well-done, although I personally prefer the old fashioned painted celluloid shorts. I found it possible to watch the entire disc without a chuckleand I even got a few laughs out of ""Godzilla."" What can you say?  Coyote using critically impaired bad engineering to maim himself, and comes back for more, while roadrunner goes ""Beep! Beep!"" At least the price is right. Perhaps, if the video did not imply James Thurber, I would have found it more enjoyable. It is really okay, but I do not,at this time at least intend to watch it again and again.  I would suggest checking out the Ben Stiller movie from the library prior making the purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A12LYZW9959CM6," The quality is excellent. It's finally good to have this movie on blu-ray.  Although, if you have a separate bass speaker, don't turn the volume up too far or you'll vibrate the floor. lol. Oh no, you didn't just shoot that green s... at me!  Line always gets me. The movie looks exceptional in high definition and the bonus materials and commentary are awesome, hearing how some of the effects are reused in other parts of the movie. The quality is once again, up to what I've come to expect from CBS Digital.  The bonus material that comes with this release is awesome, from the gag reel to the tribute to David Rappaport.  I give this a sold 5 stars. Huge Alien(s) fan here and this set is just phenomenal. The bonus material is overwhelming, I don't think I've seen it all and I've had the set for weeks, if not several months now.  The picture quality is excellent, vibrant colors, details, etc. Bought both seasons separately with 2-day shipping for less than buying them together as a combo pack regardless of shipping cost.  Unfortunately, the gag reel in Season 1 is in standard definition, unlike Season 2's high definition gag reel. The quality is what I've come to expect from CBS Digital.  Although the transition from part 1 to part 2 isn't as smooth as it should be, given the time difference...  The Klingon mythology special feature is very interesting. I haven't listened to the audio commentary, so I can't comment on that.  I give this release 5 stars, if for nothing else, the remastering quality. Bought both seasons separately with 2-day shipping for less than buying them together as a combo pack regardless of shipping cost.  Fortunately, the gag reel in Season 2 is in high definition, unlike Season 1's standard definition gag reel.  It's nice to see the show in HD. Was upset when it got cancelled, because it was finally going somewhere.  Unlike Season 1, this came in a nice slipcover box. It was nice to get all three of these movies on blu-ray as one set.  Many people don't like Poseidon, but I rather like the movie, especially the music tracks.  First time I've seen The Perfect Storm in high definition and it looks awesome. I really only watch the blu-ray. Why watch the DVD when you got the blu-ray and a player to play it in. lol.  Likewise, I haven't used the digital copy either.  I prefer this movie over JJ's first movie, but I still majorly prefer the first 10 Trek movies. The picture implied it came with a slipcover or box case, was a little disappointing when I saw it was just a shrink-wrapped case.  However, the blu-ray picture quality is exceptional, haven't watched the DVD, because well, on an LCD display, DVD versions in general look meh next to HD, mainly got the DVD for friends/family that doesn't have a BD player. Wish there had more bonus features, especially for the VFX, but I love the gag reel. The movies look great.  However, the lack of subtitles and any real bonus material was a let down. If I'd known that it would be literally just the movies, I would've shopped for the standalone releases instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AGNOPNCN6FHB6," was surprised I didn't wake up enough for all the contrived unecessary character confrontations and violence... I found Diane Lane the shining moment of the film and Dennis Miller a fish out of water but a welcome respite in the midst of a convoluted aimless plot.. Snipes is such a great talent, sorry he had to work up some lather for this stinker... i could care less about the evils performed by these women, I just wanna see Brad n Gina... yes I am desperate for entertainement so run off a cliff and die, I don't give a flyin fajita... love this film for the revenge to slime f' men n have met tooo many in my life, so will skip that discussion n go for the fun parts... thank u for such diverion in film! love me a spy vs spy film, the plot was most intriguing and Jeanette quite fetching, enjoyed the alluring gypsy camoflauge dance and the portrayal of French Occupied Spain, force all to pay homage to Napoleon, etc., perhaps not as accurate as the history books but 1937 rarely veered far from dance reviews so I enjoyed this film. never saw any mentally challenged aspects of Tim's personality compared to ANYONE in this film... the dialogue is extremely painfully slow BUT Mel makes up for it all... He seems so NORMAL compared to his other roles that this was a sweet delight! I am mad that they portray this relationship only possible if he is a complete moron... Geez, give older women a break Colleen!! Such a deeply moving film, I can barely find words to capture the intensity.  As a lover of classical piano, I always considered Chopin to be for the ear, not the heart, very flowery, exhibitionist type expression.  The tortureous plot of human and art are so majestically entertwined and elevated to beyond heavenly by films end. This tour de force is one of the most intimate in my experience. More than HIGHLY recommend! Big fan of Sex, Lies and Videotape and was hoping to see James Spader in a juicy role with Maggie G.  Complete molasses borefest.  I could not get past 30mins and that required alot of patience.  I am not expecting grand action scenes, comedy or inspiration.  How about a working script or was this an exercise to see how slow one can answer a ringing phone or slice your thigh.  Good luck with this one, do not recommend whatsoever! perhaps many inaccuracies but enough depth to portray a strong woman with God given talent and such a wonderful portrayal of dedication, perseverance, and discipline that I know is absolutely the mark of a successful woman...kudos for bringing this story to light! never saw any mentally challenged aspects of Tim's personality compared to ANYONE in this film... the dialogue is extremely painfully slow BUT Mel makes up for it all... He seems so NORMAL compared to his other roles that this was a sweet delight! I am mad that they portray this relationship only possible if he is a complete moron... Geez, give older women a break Colleen!! decided willingly to jump down the rabbit hole and be manipulated with incongruent story lines, images, and characters... kept waiting for Alice to wake up but no can do... I swear I was all in till the end and figured there has to be some type of redemption for all this mindless plot meanderings, given the Marty seal of approval, oh well, guess I will live, and not recommend this film for any purpose... OH MY DEAREST ED!!!  I luv ya BUT.... pahleeze stick to ur day job sweets...this film was paced with such formidable sinkholes in addition to plot disconnects and Viggo, aka Doc Holiday LOL, and Renee who just wants all those gorgeous men, YIKEs, at least seduce the stable lad...I trailblazed a path by actually watching this entire film with highest hopes in mind...sigh....how the West was won me wonders....wish I could have earned a eagle scout badge or sumpin...yowza the algorithm for face mash is completely erroneous due to the R(a) - R(b) like terms, there is NO rating, just pick one, left or right to pyrimid to top, and how could this on the window alert the Sys Admin to a potential crash.... as Mark smuggly responds to Admin Hearing for breach...4 hours would be a very long time in '03 to id in a secure small scale LAN... the untold story??? you want a sub-human that rapes his 12 year old daughter repeatedly and she has ptsd, you want to date some sweet seal who rapes you, then glorify these aliens... the worst level of existence imho.... slime",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A15JTJXQXO22JJ," I found a used copy of this movie on VHS long time ago. This movie was so bad I put that tape in the toaster oven and watch it burn. That was more entertaining then the in crowd altogether. 2 great movies all in one dvd. Its too good to be true and for a great price. Wayne's World 1 & 2 are awesome then in the 90's and still awesome today. Wow and I thought joe's apartment was bad! MTV has lower there standards from making this film. Never want to see any movies that has Jon Heder in it. Shame on everyone who wasted money on this! Wow and I thought joe's apartment was bad! MTV has lower there standards from making this film. Never want to see any movies that has Jon Heder in it. Shame on everyone who wasted money on this! Last time I saw her in concert was in early november 2001 during her 3rd album came out that week. 2 weeks before doing the special for HBO. This concert is exactly just as I remember it. Just not in las vegas , there moments with the troops and on have it aired on cable tv. Still one of best shows Britney has ever done. I remember seeing this movie on tv when it air on vh1. For a tv movie to my surprise I really liked it ! Kari Wuhrer is the star in this film. She should of won awards for best actress on this movie. Didn't know it came out on dvd until I found it at the drug store for 2 dollars. Just couldn't say no. What was I thinking buying this movie ? Now I know why it went straight to dvd. This is boring and overpriced to have carrying on this site. Now this is the movie they should have at the dollar store. Saw this one in theaters when it came out in the states. I have the full screen version of this movie on dvd. What a final bow for the storyline on mr.bean. Saw this one in theaters when it came out in the states. I have the full screen version of this movie on dvd. What a final bow for the storyline on mr.bean. Great another lame spin off for 40 year old virgin. Don't you think that its getting the wrong message ? A girl can lose her virginity easily and and a man has to suffer more ? That's not the first thing that comes to mind when were born in this world. Those movies are a disgrace. Shame on everyone who wasted money on this! Only saw the last half of this movie visting and wow this is one terrible movie. save your money folks! other words I'll never watch anything that has steve carell again. This is a great live performance from black sabbath / heaven & hell. Never got the chance to see live from this line up. If you love metal this is a no brainer. Get both of these formats CD & DVD. Dio will truly be missed. This movie would be great if they didn't have justin timberlake in it. The idea is so awful it would make Seth MacFarlane the creater of family guy cringe ! Can't believe there wasting money on this. Another movie involes with craigslist. first there's No Strings Attached and now this FWB. This must be stopped ! An idea never done before in a movie about advertiseing. This movie is way better than what would jesus buy ? If you love super size me , Go see this one ! If you missed out on the femme fatale tour ? Everything is there on this dvd execpt the 2 songs. He about to lose me and burning out but can't complain I still enjoyed it. minus 1 star for that and having ninki manaj ruined till the world ends in closing for the concert. But the bonus remix cd is cool. Get that edition while you can. Bounty hunters or bail enforcers whatever you call it. Lots of action , great story line , Also has behind the scenes footage , Trish Stratus in her first film. What's more to like ? Go get this to add in your collection today! Great concert on dvd but I would be happy if they released it as cd / dvd set instead. Minus one star for that sony! Its so timeless and also way overdue finally putting this out. Nice way to celebrate bad 25 with this amazing show. This movie would be great if they didn't have justin timberlake in it. The idea is so awful it would make Seth MacFarlane the creater of family guy cringe ! Can't believe there wasting money on this. Another movie involes with craigslist. first there's No Strings Attached and now this FWB. This must be stopped ! This should have never been made. The movie wasn't that great either. I'm glad this show got cancelled because of poor ratings. Wouldn't surprise me if I saw this at the dollar store. Christian mingle must of been so desperate to make this crappy movie so they can promote there dating site. Even the trailer is so pathetic. Why is this movie made I'll never know. Saw this movie on cable long time ago. Thought it was awesome. Stunned there's no dvd release. This movie needs to be back on tv and own on dvd right away. This is comedy gold right here. If you like the divas from WWF now know as WWE. This is a must have in your video collection. Your not gonna find this on DVD. You get to see lots of skin. The Kat's flash from Armageddon in 2000. Tori , Trish Stratus & Ivory in wet tshirts that will make your jaw drop ! If you enjoy watching or owning the other wwe divas dvds. Go see this one. Sadly this will be there last of there video series. The divas in this dvd have Maria, Kristal, Victoria, Torrie Wilson, Ashley, Mickie James, Stacy Keibler, Sharmell, Lita, Melina, Candice Michelle and Trish Stratus. The documentary is very done and you get to hear kurt's voice through out the whole film. If you read the book come as you are then you'll gonna like this. There was alot of hype before this movie came out. example wal-mart won't carry this movie. Too bad this movie wasn't worth seeing again. Like the idea for this movie but the main person rev. billy keeps getting arrested or kicked out everywhere they go. Could of done better this one is just a bore. Saw this movie in theaters. I had mixed feelings about this film too. I'm glad we get to see what the tour could of been. It's sad it didn't go out as planned and his passing is way too soon. His music will live on forever. Everything is there but why the original version of blood on the dance floor is not on this set and only the remix? No captain eo , No full length version of ghosts and why moonwalker is not released in the states on dvd? I still like the box set but it just feels incomplete ah close enough. Not bad for a straight to dvd release film from wwe. Of course the only reason too get this movie is because paige is in this. She's awesome in this movie , As for the miz not so much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3LKCTONDQHR4, Arrived on time and in excellent condition. A good action movie that as usual shows off Harrison Fords acting ability. The movie in of its self I thought is good and well paced good action thru out with what I thought as a happy ending. I watch it from time to time and always enjoy it. Its one that I have put in my collection you might too. I recommend this movie highly as well as the seller. Item arrived on time and in good condition. The movie overall was not as I remembered it but overall it's theme and story line was good. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action but with a family oriented ending. Arrived on time and in good condition. While mainly focusing on two characters which were enemies in a war of petty this is my hill not yours theme. In the end find out there very alike and the two made peace for all a final happy ending. Arrived on time in good condition. The way the movie starts out is interesting in that keeping the secrete he is a government agent  actually. All the while he makes out like he is a salesman of computer systems. In the process of trying to give his wife some excitement in life it all unfolds to be some thing exciting. Great movie to watch and enjoy it. I would recommend this movie to others! Arrived on time and in excellent condition. A serious but funny movie that by situations in the movie realizes almost to late. Someone he never thought likes him and almost misses his chance to a better life but by intervention by people who care figures it out. So as they a happy ending. A addition to my collection as hope others will feel the same. I recommend this film. Arrived on time and in excellent condition. The movie was an interesting spin to the past for me. As a movie it is very funny in both situation and comedic action. More suited to the more mature view audience. But would recommend for other ones collections as I added it to mine. Arrived on time and in great condition. My feelings is that you have to either the kind of person or be in the mood for this style of movie. As an outsider describing the series of events as how and when. As reporter would do it. Not my cup of tea but maybe the perfect for the right person. Personally as for me I would not recommend this movie. Arrived on time and in excellent condition. Purchased for my son as a gift. My son really likes this particular Anime and for me its a challenge to keep track of it but I am glad as he enjoys it very much. I recommend this movie and the seller. Nice selection of disaster movies. The switch up of selections of fairly recent movies I thought would keep somebody entertained. Don't try to read into them as they are for entertainment not for scientific exactness. I would like to think this is a set that periodically want from time to time watch one of the movies over again. Arrival was right on the time it was said to arrive. Was in great condition. The movie it was was well thought out. The characters were well cast to the rolls and they played the rolls as I expected they would. Was intriguing and very exciting thru out the movie. Hope to see more of this story lines type of thinking and originality. I would recommend this movie definitely. Arrived on time and in great condition. Interesting twist to a idea that others have premised before. A lot of good action and well played roles but I I am far cry from an experienced reviewer. I found it to be entertaining to watch may not frequently but every so often. I find to add to my collection worth while. I think you will too. I recommend selection for ones collection. Arrived on time and in excellent condition. Okay plot and scenario could have been better thought out. Otherwise interesting movie a little more special effects would have been nice. A movie to watch when the mood to watch a entertaining move with an interesting disaster theme. I would recommend this movie. Arrived on time and in excellent condition. Interesting twist to a very interesting and some what over used idea. Liked the special effects acting pretty decent. Overall I liked this one pretty well and added it my collection I it make a good addition to ones collection. I recommend this film. Arrived on time and excellent condition. I found two the selections interesting seemed like the rest were repeats of others they seemed did not interest at me at all. I personally I think could find better selections. I personally Don't recommend but the seller yes. Arrived on time and great condition. Another great movie in tradition with great except for a couple of movies. Plot and story were cohesive well done animation and story line but my view may be biased since I have an extreme like of the story since my child hood and now I am 49yrs old.  I  known may chuckle about it but just can't this addiction. Can surely recommend both movie and seller !! Arrived on time and in excellent condition. The movie good CGI Effects acting fairly decent overall a pretty good movie worth a look for sure better that what mostly has been coming out lately as far in the disaster genre. I recommend both movie and seller. Arrived on time and in excellent condition. A good story line and some very interesting twists and some very good acting at least to me. I will not go any further in this review to give anything away that could ruin the viewing of the movie. I recommend both the movie and seller. Arrived on time and excellent condition. Have two of the  titles already but sometimes I want to watch all three together I know lazy but true. But it is a good set of picks to have so don't have to buy all three and can enjoy at your leisure. I would definitely recommend this set of movies. Arrived on time and in excellent condition. Fair plot and acting special effects were mediocre. I think a little more special effects but it could be just me in my assessment. Interesting the good guy dose not make unusual ending for most movies which one part that makes this movie a fairly good rating. Would endorse movie and seller.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1IWR4YH4ZA9BM," So Weird and Creepy.  I read a book that was kind of like this.  The man is obsessed with taking his wife and three or four children away from the mad world to the middle of nowhere.  Unbelievable trials and tribulations that they went through.  Loved this movie.  Had no idea Harrison Ford had made it. I've seen this twice and will probably see it again.  Whoopi was young when this movie was made and I love the handsome Ray Liotta.  The little girl we all know, and her smile lights up a room.  What a great movie.  On the order of The Help. What a great movie.  I really liked him in this....hadn't realized he had made this movie and I was so glad I found it.  Full of thrills and adventure.  My kind of movie. I stopped this movie about a quarter of the way in, so I can't give a really good opinion of it.  It wasn't pulling me in, so I just turned it off.  I may yet try it again. Not too into this one, even though I love Angela Bassett.  She is beautiful.  But it was all about her having sex with a younger man.  Sex, sex, sex.  If you like that this movie is for you.  I turned it off. Absolutely fantastic movie!!!!!!  Everyone should see this one, it has everything to make you feel good, laugh and cry..and see the beauty of two misfits that get together to make one great team! Whoa, I am sure that Drew Barrymore is pretty embarrassed by this movie.  it was the epitome of stupid and I was so bored and embarrassed for her that I had to turn it off. I love this movie!  The artwork is really beautiful and lifelike and the story is a lovely one.  It is one of those you want to keep in your shelf to watch over or let your kids or grandkids watch. Yes this was funny in places but it really got to getting me upset that anyone would be stupid enough to choose this flake as a surrogate much less continue to put up with her stunts.  Not so good This brought us into the homes of Jewish (with a lesbian daughter and her significant other), Vietnamese, Latino and African American families, and all of the family drama, paired with unconditional love, that they all brought to the table.  It was interesting watching the different traditional, yet ethnic inspired meals that were being prepared!  I really enjoyed it from beginning to end.  Great actors! This is the funniest movie!!!  Everyone should take a peek at this one.  Jack was great as the guy that went from girl to girl never seeing their true inner beauty...until....SURPRISE!!!  Very Funny!!! Is this woman the only black star in the entire world for lead romantic roles?  I don't know, but I'm getting kind of sick of looking at her.  The movie  was okay though and I watched it all the way through. I LOVE BONES...CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT.  Even  though the female lead drives you crazy the first few seasons, you grow to love her.  An amazing program.  I've watched them all. Russell Crowe is the bad guy in this movie and he does a good job of it.  Lots of anticipation as a nice man that is going to lose his farm decides to take him in to the law for the bounty so he can save his farm.  Crowe has a wicked and ruthless band of baddie guys that decide to free him.  WOW This was made before Renee was a twig and it is REALLY funny, so this is the second or third time I've watched it since it came out.  A good one. This movie was amazingly accurate and scary.  About a woman who was married to a policeman but divorced him and he stalked her and made her life miserable to the point of .....true story Cinderella movies are so adorable.  Even as an adult I love to watch them once in awhile, so I like owning them.  This one is just as adorable as the First. This is a great movie that everyone should watch at least once.  Her husband is accused of murdering innocent people during war.  His wife is a lawyer and fights the government while trying to keep herself from being killed. I had seen this before and had forgotten it had been so long, but kids will love it, ....adults will tolerate it.  Not horrible, just light entertainment that is a tad far fetched.  But so is Eddie Murphy. WOW, as I said, this was a fast paced blood curdling adventure thriller that kept me glued to the set! It is one of my all time favorites and I have seen it three times!!!  Best movie EVER Who doesn't love to look at all of those muscle shots of the Rock?  Plus he is going around with a two by four carved out to be a huge baseball bat, cleaning up crime.  He can come to my place an clean up any crime he would like....or er grime....whatever. Sorry, but if I'm not interested in the first movie I am through with the season.  This was kind of stupid, actually.  Maybe it was meant to be a satire and I just didn't catch on, but ....either way....STUPID. This is one of those great fight movies from the Roman Days...we don't have enough of them as far as I'm concerned.  This is one of the better ones.  I loved it. This was FANTASTIC  I enjoyed every minute of it.  I enjoyed it so much that I watched two more movies of Elizabeth 1st.  But they did not tell the same stories exactly which made me wonder which story was true. I tend to think this PBS one would be the true one. This is so adorable, and the accompanying music is awesome.  I ended up purchasing the sheet music/book.  Good for children and adults.  My friend, from Great Britain told me about this, and I was pleasantly surprised. I know this went on for season after season, but I didn't really make it through one show.  Maybe I have to try harder.  But should I have to TRY to like something?  I don't think so. This was the most boring movie ever put on the screen.  Absolutely went nowhere.  People dropped in a pit and walking around separating and meeting each other with an intermittent person eaten by a bull One of the best Series out there.  A brother team working for the FBI. One with a PHD in Mathematics and the other using his cunning and gut instincts to solve crimes.  It is absolutely AMAZING how this guy solves crimes with mathematics.  Exciting, Funny and Wonderful.  Judd Hersh is the father which adds a little more wonderful to the series. One of the Great Movies out There. It is definitely 50's material and not deep by any means.  But it is entertaining and takes you back to the 50's where romance was passion and not blatant sex. I always have to watch this movie once in awhile.  I'm a 68 year old woman and I have been watching it since I was a child.  One of the Best of Disney's creations. If you want creepy this is really it!  Scary to the nth degree!  They think they have had the city quarantined long enough so that the ""disease"" (eeeek) is under control, until they let people back in..... I'm giving ALL the Doc Martin series a 1, simply because I am on Amazon to get away from commercials.  I do not like them, do not want them, and Doc Martin is full of them!  No thanks As I thought it would be, Juno was an adorable movie.  This girl has a body of a three year old and a mind of a 40 year old.  Very entertaining. This movie should be required in all schools.  A little bit of the truth was in it and it was really good.  Showing about the truth and if we really hear it or not on the news. Jason Statham you are a hunk in a movie, that's all I've got to say.  I have seen all of them, I believe and all are action packed high octane and have a good plot. This movie had a ton of good actors in it and it was a story line with several couples trying to cope with or find love.  It put me off on ever wanting to find romance. I adore this beautiful and soft spoken actress.  This is one of a series of movies about her and the live and people in a small town.  It's amazing and I wish there more because I got totally hooked on them! I'm giving ALL the Doc Martin series a 1, simply because I am on Amazon to get away from commercials.

It's amazing and I wish there more because I got totally hooked on them! This was one of the best movies I've seen in SO long!  Mr. Friend, the male part did an EXCELLENT job, as he always does.  I'm a fan.  So Romantic and so true to the life of this girl thrown into being a Queen at an early age. I COULDNT GET A3AY FROM THE TV THIS WAS SO GOOD!!  I never wanted this series to end.  LOVE SIMON BAKER!  He plays a great quirky part and when this man smiles it's an entirely new experience.  Amazing smile.  I WANT MOOOORRRE! This was so good that I spent three days just sitting there and watching the entire ...all of the seasons, non stop.  it is amazing...something new...not the same old thing.  I LOVED IT!!!!! Loved this movie.  Viggo Mortensen made me fall in love with him in this movie so I ordered EVERY one of his movies.  Very good western and true to life adventure. Really cute.  I have seen this twice and enjoyed it both times.  Am a fan of matthew Mcconaughey since his academy award and great performance!  He's just as good in comedies. If you're a dog lover, you'll be crazy about this.  If you're not, it will move you.  It's about every day life'S struggles and joys, along with its sadnesses.  A great flick! How can you not love this!  The pictures are beautiful and heart stopping.  And it is entertainment personified if you are interested in the world around you and the animals in it. Okay, I'll give it three stars.  It is more like two.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the vest either.  A mild entertainment.  This guy was rude.  But what most of us think Security guards are. I LOVE BONES...CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT.  Even  though the female lead drives you crazy the first few seasons, you grow to love her.  An amazing program.  I've watched them all. This is cute, but not something I yearn to see series after series.  A couple of them were entertaining and then I was ready to stop.  I may go back later though. Katherine Heigl is a doll...so is her counterpart in this movie.  She has her choice between one or the other. And you will have to wonder who she picks.  Lots of fun I am telling you, this guy can't make a bad movie, can he?  I wish he would never age, because when he can't make these fancy moves any more I will be missing these great movies.  Him paired with her was a great combination.  She knows nothing, but accidently gets the job done, making it humorous yet adventurous. We haven't heard it all yet, about how we became the humans we are.  Very interesting documentary with Alan Alda as your host.  He goes through the ages with scientists showing how we became who we are, and why some didn't What a great movie.  If more families with plenty of love and money to go around could rescue more great kids that are in the position Michael was what a greater world this would be.  The movie was heartwarming, funny and moving.  His little brother, CRACKED ME UP! Even though I don't like Alec, I just love Meryl Streep.  She can do no wrong, and it proved it again in this movie.  But if only they could get Alec out of it.  this guy needs to go on a diet or retire.  Sorry that was cruel, but, from what I hear, so is he. I enjoyed this movie a lot.  I have never seen this male actor, but he was good in this part.  The woman is trying to get to her boyfriend of many years who is in Europe to propose to him on leap year.  Having a very hard time getting there so she is forced to hire a man to help her get there.  Funny. This was really boring.  I kept waiting for something to happen.  I have to admit I watched the first film, but I usually take my cue from that.  Not for me. OMG< OMG!!! This movie is too amazing for words.  It should have five stars, period.  This is actually happening.  Things like this actually happen!  Love Ryan Reynolds and he was great in this.  Photography was great too. Creepy and no real substance to this movie.  Two scientists create this killer thing and the woman keeps talking the man into keeping it when he wants to kill it from the start.  He should have.  But I watched for what seemed like forever and it was all about them hiding this thing from everyone else. I am an adult that read all of the books in this series and loved them.  The movie was just as great and the animation so real life.  A great entertains movie. OMG< OMG!!! This movie is too amazing for words.  It should have five stars, period.  This is actually happening.  Things like this actually happen!  Love Ryan Reynolds and he was great in this.  Photography was great too. Really a cute movie about a man that has lost touch with his two little kids and  his wife....until a couple of penguins show up at his door in a cart.  Funny! Okay, the movie was really scary...and I have seen it twice because it was so good, but I just can't get past this girls lips.  This constant HUGE pout kind of creeps you out and you can't keep your mind on the movie.  But this one was soo scary that I think thriller lovers will get thrilled with this one! WOW, this was an amazing movie!!!  Of course, I kind of knew that if Matthew McConaughey was in it that it was going to be good, but i had no idea HOW good.  You will love this one no matter what kind of movies you like! This is an amazing true story heart stopping thriller about a train that has gone rogue and the two men that try to stop it at the risk of their own lives.  Great A+ WHAT A FUNNY MOVIE!  I love both of these actors anyway, and Ryan Reynolds is one of my very favorite.  He always delivers. He is a single fun loving guy and his friend is married with twins.  They wish for each others lives and .....guess what? This was so great.  A couple passes away and their two best friends, who are not married, and who don't like each other, are named as the parents of their child.  GREAT movie. This was an UNBELIEVABLE series!  There was so much going on I ate up every single series so quickly I could hardly make time for sleeping!  LOTS of blatant sex in these, but also LOTS of excitement and it really lets you know what it was like in the time of Spartacus.  Amazing Kind of entertaining, but not my absolute  favorite Nicholas Cage movie.  it was more of a scary thriller.  They are taking a suspected witch to a church where the last remaining book to cast the devil out of her is located.  no easy task. My girlfriend and I watched this and we were laughing out loud through the whole thing.  Adam Sandler is a plastic surgeon and when you see some of the people that come in to get fixed you about die laughing. this is a really, really funny movie about a mother who just wants her son to be happy and a son who is gay and afraid to tell Mom who already knows.  And when she finds out, the fun begins.  She wants to find a man for her son!!  FUNNY This was definitely a different movie.  Very exciting.  This guy went all the way to the top by becoming a genius through a strange drug that he was given free by someone and then couldn't stop using. This was a good movie but lacked adventure.  It was just as advertised.  One man tracking another.  But the other is innocent and this guy doesn't know it and the one he is tracking has to prove his innocence along the trek. Ha Ha Ha what a hilarious movie!  Each bridesmaid has her own distinct personality and each and every one are so funny that you end up laughing through the hysterics that are playing out.  Should see this. This was a wild and crazy thriller ride from beginning to end.  I thought it would be a remake of the old Arnold Schwarzenegger  Total Recall, but it was different but great.  I loved it! I think this movie was foreign with English captions.  I have no idea, because I was so wrapped up in the captions that I didn't even notice it.  Very, very good movie..Amazing movie I didn't want this series to end!  I just loved it from beginning to end.  Lots of visual nudity in this, which was a tad of a shock, but it was the way of the times, I suppose.  I loved the action! I have no idea what this was all about....I kept waiting for the real movie to start.  It was like a grainy old sit com with poor acting, and I thought maybe this was her job and pretty soon the movie was going to start when they stopped shooting the sit com...but evidently not.  Stay away from this one.  Poor acting, pathetic and horrible quality. This woman is so funny that it is hard to believe.  But what Jason Bateman puts up with in order to return her home to get his job and identity back.....well, the average person would have killed her or run home screaming far sooner. I liked this a lot.  The Captain Kirk in this movie is absolutely adorable...from a woman's standpoint.  I was obsessed with trying to remember how his hair was cut.  Really unusual.  I've seen him in other movies since.  This movie had a different twist that kept you glued. Just like the old series that was on tv years ago...hercules...  One escapade after another...but the lead staris hard to look at and his friend, who just happens to be named Hercules, but is just the opposite in every way, is a sopping drunk.  Nah,  Not my cup of tea. I guess this was an all time favorite with everyone, but even though it was funny, it was a sad true funny, which I couldn't take much of, so I only watched two shows. This was an UNBELIEVABLE series!  There was so much going on I ate up every single series so quickly I could hardly make time for sleeping!  LOTS of blatant sex in these, but also LOTS of excitement and it really lets you know what it was like in the time of Spartacus.  Amazing This was really funny, so if you are in the mood to have a few laughs you can't miss out with this one.  It isn't ""dumb"", as I expected it to be!  I was roaring in some scenes.  The son is a CRACKUP, with his crazy eyebrows.  He's actually been in plenty of movies and is an up and coming star.  LIked it A LOT There could be no other Iron Man than Robert Downey Jr.  He fills his metal shoes well and as he is zipping here and there fighting all kinds of wild crime he is coming out with little one liners that crack you up....without him cracking up.  Love all the Iron Man movies! I bought this forgetting that I had already seen it.  One thing I wish Amazon would do, as they do with their Kindle books.....remind you that you previously purchased this item, because I have paid for more than I really wanted as a result of not having that feature.  But the movie is one of the good ones that all Romantic Comedy buffs will enjoy. This is one of a kind in the nature series genre.  The geologist takes us back some 4 to 500 million years and takes us to the present in a truly entertaining and eye opening group of films.  Amazing. This Disney movie was a bore.  I adore Disney animated movies, but from the beginning it was a long drawn out narrative of Dory, Dory, Dory.  A never ending Ellen Degeneres monologue!  To top it off, it was almost identical, really, to Finding Nemo, but with Dory looking for her parents instead of Nemo.  Not thrilled with it, and sorry I didn't rent instead of buying.  I'll never watch it again.  For a three year old, might be nice. If you want to see a great movie this is the one.  I saw it advertised as a ""cult classic"" so checked it out.  Really, really good.  Loved the kid in this movie. This was an amazing movie, even though there was really only one person....a woman..in the entire thing.  One minute she is happily going about her visit to a cabin in the middle of nowhere and the next minute there is no way out.  Touching, exciting, dramatic....it has it all.  Good Movie This kid is the most adorable kid you have ever seen.  With the I.Q. of about ten thousand, he shows up on the doorstep of a couple looking to adopt a foster child.  He says he was sent from the Foster Home after they put in an application to adopt him.  From there it is just one miracle after another. I am sure that Mr. Redford got plenty of bucks to play the part in this movie and get wet over and over again, but it was totally unbelievable for a man this age, and I think he, of course, said about four words. I have not seen all of this but I have seen a few, and each one is a new adventure, and quite enjoyable.  It isn't addictive, but I enjoy it for light entertainment. This was a little shocking at times, but wow, .....wow.  About  two sex addicts, the families of sex addicts and alcoholics in a support group.  I never really understood sex addiction...what it was.  Found out, from seeing this that I have a friend who is one.  Amazing.  And it actually was a pretty good movie with a great story line. Blah, blah, blah.  It was a movie full...just full of talking.  Of a downtrodden Julia Louis Dreyfus...so downtrodden, in fact, that I could barely stand to watch it.  And her counterpart was just as disturbing.  What a last movie to go out with.  Awful. I should have known anything by Jackass would have been something for a jackass to watch.  I got so bored that i turned it off 1/4 o the way through.  The makeup on ""grandpa"" who is a much younger man, was so obvious it was stupid.  Stupid stupid movie. Great movie.  It was very emotional and it didn't matter at all that it was English subtitled.  One of those movies that you just get into so deeply that you don't notice it.  Great movie. Well Stallone and the Governor should quit acting in these hard hitting movies because, although, Stallone keeps his body in good shape ( ""I'll be back"" doesn't), they just don't fit into the mold of all of these heroics.  Time to act your age, boys. I adore this beautiful and soft spoken actress.  This is one of a series of movies about her and the live and people in a small town.  It's amazing and I wish there more because I got totally hooked on them! if you are into documentaries you might like this.  But I am not.  It was too much talking and interviewing, even though I am sure this man deserved many kudos for his heroics. OMG  I had no idea this could have been such a good movie McConaughey deserved an academy award for this!  Amazing, and hurtful and inciteful.  It makes you want to get a hold of the pharmaceutical companies and just blow them up!  The greed.  It is a true story!!!!!!!  This is what we are living with!!!!!  And what aids patients have lived with!!!  GETS YOU ON A SOAPBOX!!! This had a good story line but it was way to repetitive.  When does this thing end or when does something happen.  But I did make through the whole thing.  It is a true story, I believe. I almost didn't watch this!  And I really would have missed a good movie.  With shots of the past and the present, this movie leads you on a ride you don't want to get off! What an amazing movie.  What a plot!  This is a great film and I think just about anyone would enjoy it.  It is so different and keeps you guessing throughout the entire thing.  I'm STILL guessing! I loved this story from beginning to just before the end. I really was disappointed at the end, but i suppose that would be unforgivable.  When you see the movie you will understand. Not sure if this should get a three or a one, but I am giving it the benefit of the doubt and letting it have three.  Poor Ice Cube....a cop riding along with a dimwit.....and Poor Ice Cube....having to play this part.  And I feel sorry for his partner that played a wimp very well.  Awful. LOVE THOSE AVENGERS.  I've seen every single one of their movies and LOVED THEM.  This one is no exception.  I am 68 and love it, so I think it is for all ages! Dumb documentary that was kind of a foolish tale that turns around the hidden alien theory, stating that the U.S. government actually created the hoax to hide the things they planes, etc., they were working on.  Boring to the nth degree. Wow, this was a different one, and I truly enjoyed every minute of it.  Very different type of fantasy with lots of things going on to keep you entertained.  And of course....JOHNNY DEPP.  What can I say? This is so amazing.  One of those cartoons that looks beyond real...better than real.  The story of Tarzan is not EXACTLY as we have all read it to be, but still, very fun!  I absolutely loved it and it should have more stars. I'm s 69 year old woman.  Much to my surprise, I thought this movie ROCKED from beginning TO THE END!  Now I will go back and watch the ones I've missed. I adore this beautiful and soft spoken actress.  This is one of a series of movies about her and the live and people in a small town.  It's amazing and I wish there more because I got totally hooked on them! Really liked this human on the side of Robot existence movie.  It put a new slant on things and I truly enjoyed every minute of it.  Banderas is so talented and who did we see but  his wife Melanie. These two actors were great in this movie.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end and this is the second time I've seen it!  Just as good the second time around This movie was amazingly put together and what a magnificent set!!  It blew my mind.  It also has a section that shows you how they built everything, how they choreographed and created costumes.  Must watch that too.  Amazing YAY, I won, when I picked this one.  Really entertaining and set in the period that I love the most.  Will keep you entertained....I got through at least 5 Seasons so that says a lot! This was the most AMAZING movie!  It made you sigh, laugh, be lonely, be happy, be in love, lose love......need I say more?  And Blythe Danner and the handsomest man in the world?  That wasn't bad either. This was so good that I was SORRY when it ended.  I wanted more and more seasons, but I guess there's only so much you can say about King Tut, right?  Very Good. I enjoyed this full length animated movie so much.  An elder of an African village is telling a wonderful story, to the village children, with life like stick figures.  It is about a boy's promise to protect a dying mother giraffe's baby with his life and the adventures that fall in his path along the way.  Really beautiful, life-like animation! Beyond amazing, touching, tingling, sensational heart warming movie.  Tom Hanks, portrayed James Donohue, a real live , everyday American lawyer, who took it upon himself to bring home close to 10,000 POW's! Three stars?  I can't imagine!  From characters to costumes and the never ending ...tales, this is a very special and entertaining movie that will grab at your imagination and your heart. WOW!  It's been a very long time since I've seen a good western and this was just that!  Too in depth to explain here, but if you like movies with action and a little bit of romance, you'll love the gumption of this woman and the man that came back to save her, her husband and kids after coming home from a civil war prison and the surprises that await them both. Creepy Thriller with Ray Liotta as an out of control horribly mean guy ready to be put to death for murders, etc.  No actor that I know can play mean better than Ray Liotta. He can make those beautiful eyes look SO mean.  They give him a trade on freedom for being able to use him as a lab rat for a take-away-evil drug.  Spooky Okay.  Disappointed to the 9th degree.  This is the SECOND, movie I've rented today, that is so bad I had to quit after less than 10 minutes of watching!  Horrible movie!  You don't have ANY idea what in the heck this plot is even supposed to be.  Acting is 70's at best. I forced my way through the first one, but having to fast forward through the graphic, sick murder and a few other scenes.  Then I went to number two and just had to give up.  I liked the main star and tried it because of him, but now I'm nauseous.  Who writes this horrible stuff?  It has to be someone who has some DEEP problems!  Horrible!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1X414Z4CQH16M," My husband likes this movie very much.  It is one of his favorites.  We pretty much like anything Harrison Ford.  In our opinion, he is a great talent.  Air Force One has a very creative story line with a lot of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  We are replacing an old VHS tape with this DVD.  This is a very good movie. The movie Speed was well written with an exceptional cast of actors.  Its story had a totally believable plot with a truly disturbed character.  I would recommend this movie for almost anyone's library. Who does not like the work of George C. Scott?  He was brilliant in his portrayal of the old miser Ebenezer Scrooge.  A Christmas Carol has been a holiday tradition in my family for many years.  I would recommend it. Every time I see this movie, it makes me cry.  This is one to see on a rainy night with popcorn and a box of tissues.  It takes you through a full range of emotions.  I highly recommend this old movie. The movie Speed was well written with an exceptional cast of actors.  Its story had a totally believable plot with a truly disturbed character.  I would recommend this movie for almost anyone's library. Several years I bought this workout on VHS.  I was glad to discover that it was on DVD.  It is a challenging workout and I feel an essential part of my workout library.  I would recommend this to a friend. At my age, I felt that I needed a workout that would provide me with an opportunity to perform more stretching and strengthening of my muscles.  I felt that yoga would provide that.  This yoga DVD is good because it provides a short, but a challenging workout. The scenery and music provides a very calming affect.  I would recommend this to a friend. I liked this series very much.  The actors made you feel that they were really family.  Even though they lived in The Projects of Chicago, they took it all in stride and let their love for one another see them through the tough times.  This series will make the thankful for your blessing.  It will also help you find the courage to pick yourself up in the bad times.  I would recommend this season. Whenever I want a really good laugh, I go back to the shows that did it best.  Good Times was one of those shows that did it for me.  The plots were well written and the characters well developed.  Even though the Evans' family faced many hard times, they made it through with love.  They made even the bad times seem like good times.  I recommend this series. I have to give this video 5 stars because it really deserves it.  It's great!  This instructor really knows her stuff.  The workout is fun and extremely challenging.  I really like the different level of workout routines that you can choose.  You can choose to workout individual muscle groups.  I have seen a slight result already.  I would recommend this product. I have done Pilates in the past and enjoyed it as a workout.  This DVD provides a short, but effective workout.  I look forward to using it as a part of my workout routine.  I would recommend it to a beginners of yoga or Pilates, but not to the advanced practitioners.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A18DX1AT72SY95," This was another movie I didn't really like the first time around. I just didn't find it interesting or funny. Heck, I still don't find it funny. But I do think it's a great movie about a recent graduate unsure where to go in life in love with a woman much older than him. it's a decent movie, but no matter how many times I see it, I just can't get into it. We all know she can surf, but something is stopping her. I don't know how many times I thought, just do it and get over it I love south park, honestly. But I have problems with the set. For one, Trey and Matt introduce every episode. At first it was funny, but then after the 10th one you watch and there's almost no difference between them until there's a new setting, they lose the humor. The episodes are funny. That's really my only problem I think the packaging is awful. each disc is in a cardboard sleeve with one disc on one side and another on the other. There isn't even a booklet to show you what episodes are on what discs. Old school is definitely the best! When Kermit was still on the show, elmo was no where to be found, and the show was random and hilarious. The show has changed so much, and not for the best. Its fun to look back on these episodes and laugh madly. Its nice to have all the bonus clips but I would love to have seen more full episodes I love the Powerpuff girls. I always have and wanted this box set desperately. I have no problem with the show. It's just as funny as I remember. The problem is that the disc are double sided. I bought one set and three discs were scratched and two refused to play. Shame on cartoon Network! I liked the movie, but I'm a huge Harley Quinn fan, and what I didn't like was how she took a backseat role in this. Batgirl, bumblebee girl, wonder woman, and super girl are the main characters here, and Harley is just a background one, which disappointed me. What was nice was the bonus features came with a short with her that was pretty good I never read the book so I can't speak on it but I really enjoyed this movie. It's about a baby that's adopted by a group of young boys who can't stand to part with her. She blossoms into a young woman but wants to find her biological family. It's a very nice story about family and growing up Belles on their toes lives up to the first movie, cheaper by the dozen. It also continues the story from the first movie and for some reason, has a lot more musical numbers than the first. It has plenty of laughs but an abrupt ending. I haven't actually watched the shows yet, but the package looked like it had soaked in a bath tub for an hour. I could not get it open. I had to tear the package apart, destroying it in the process, just to get it open. The discs were perfect, but still........ I buy a lot of commercial compilation DVDs and while I love them, I hate seeing some of them over and over. Or seeing 10 coffee commercials for Folgers in a row. While they were some on this DVD I saw, the majority I hadn't. The commercials were not only funny but some featured characters i grew up watching like bugs Bunny and mighty mouse. I highly recommend this DVD! I made Bart in my pants!  Now onto the review: I always worry that I may not like the newer seasons of the Simpsons, because people are so down on them but I love this season! The Simpsons get a reality show, Lisa gets spelling fever, Homer sues the church and Bart moves out of the house. This season is hilarious and so much fun to watch. Another great season! The Simpsons go to England, Homer becomes the nicest man in town (for one episode), and turns into the grim reaper, and battles a bear! His mother returns, too! And remember when lisa jealous of Maggie? This season is pure fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AOAAX92CVVC1M," I read the book and enjoyed it thoroughly. I didn't expect that any movie would come close, but (with minor changes) this is the book in an exciting and dramatic mini-series. The characters are so fun! Great little movie.  NB: There are a few scenes with scantily clad people in bed together... nothing much, just part scenes thrown in... if those things bother you... be forewarned :) Super cool and exciting action movie! Clean. Not overly scary ;) Didn't appreciate the kids picking on each other, but happy they moved past that at the end. Great story line. Recommended for ages 12 and up.  A brother and sister don't know their parents are spies until they disappear, throwing the kids into the fray. Exciting tale with lots of super cool gadgets :) I read the book and enjoyed it thoroughly.

NB: There are a few scenes with scantily clad people in bed together... nothing much, just part scenes thrown in... if those things bother you... be forewarned :) If you'd like a short that will make you laugh, this is the one to pick. A fun and quick way to brighten your day :) I always like happy endings. A documentary of the medal of honor itself and of its recipients. Well done and (mostly) engagingly put together... it is all very informative, just slightly boring sometimes :)  Documents recipients, and how/why they got the medal, from its creation during the American civil war to the first five years of the War in Afghanistan/Iraq. Lots of material. Good history lesson. Positives: Video clips as well as pictures from her different movies Interviews with different people who knew her and acted with her Overall history of her life -- with notable people, facts, and dates included  Negatives: No interview with Shirley herself Can seem a little slow paced some times  Overall a great little peek into the child star's acting career A definite must-see for World War II history buffs! Very informational documentary, yet put together in a interesting and catching way. How US artists used their craft to fool the German military.  Only thing I didn't care for were the sketches they show from the whore houses they visited. Had never heard of this even till I watched this documentary on it. Has real footage from different things going on, including the day of the shooting. Lots of more modern interviews with people who were students or guards then. Fascinating bit of history that sparked some interesting conversation with older relatives. Worth watching! Travel to 6-7 places around the world that are ""the greatest."" Both desert and wetlands, snow and rocky mountains... visit Madagascar, Tibet, Greenland, the Amazon, and other places. The narrator has a nice voice. The film isn't dramatic. More like something you watch before or as you are going to bed - nice animals, nice scenery, nothing to get your adrenals going. The film is 1 hour & 30 minutes. The first 45 minutes set the scene... and are pretty boring, but important for understanding the significance of the story's ending. The last 45 minutes had lots of action... fighting fires, rescuing people, close calls with death, etc.  Film basically shows the lives of WWII firefighters from before training, during training, day-to-day life as a fireman, and fighting fires during the blitz.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2BR12BYIGV1ER," I first bought the soundtrack, ""Sorcerer"" in 1978, and loved it. But I NEVER saw the movie . I FINALLY bought it, and watched it.  WOW, What a Intense Movie!!! I was on the edge of My seat from minute 1 !!! After 35 Years, I again, Finally got to enjoy this Great Movie!!! I Highly Recommend this Great Movie!! 5 Stars!!! This is one of those movies where I said I'd buy it later, and I did, but sold it when I got broke. But now I bought it, and enjoyed it, and WON'T sell it this time! lol But seriously, this is a great movie. I recommend it! Plus it has SEAN YOUNG! lol Cool how they had THE MIGHTY THOR in one episode, and then they had THE MAN WITHOUT FEAR, DAREDEVIL! Seems like they were trying to get a series for these guys. But let's not forget about The BIG GUY, THE INCREDIBLE HULK_!!! RRRROOOOOAAAAAAAARRRR!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, I 1st was turned on to it by BILL NELSON in the 80's, I bought his album DAS CABINET, then got into it from there. But this is a GREAT DVD! OH BOY, I've been wanting this movie on DVD for the longest time, I have it on VHS, but it's recorded, so, for my DVD collection, it was a MUST! These SHAW BROS. flicks are so cool! It's like the guys are not really fighting, but performing a long form, or kata. So fluid! HELLO BUFFY ANNE SUMMERS!!! Hey, I bought this series back when it came out, with every intention of watching it! But I got broke before I could actually watch it and sold it. But NOW I'm watching this series from THE START, and I am enjoying it immensely !!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS SERIES!!! After ordering this product and waiting a entire month for it, it looked like someone stomped on the dvd, the casing all shattered. The discs are fine, just the outer shell is pretty much destroyed. What a HEADACHE it was waiting for this order. Actually, I NEVER REALLY SEEN ANY OF THESE FLICKS, just a peek here and there, I always said I'd catch it. Then, there was 4 films! So I'm ordering this to get ready to watch PROMETHEUS. May GOD help us all... I was given this set as a gift, and I couldn't have been more happier! I read this book (yes, I read the entire book, it was the big Red slipcase edition) a few years back, and, from what I remember, this movie is right on the money! I imagined everything from the round doors in Hobbiton to the battle for Middle Earth! I'm glad that we have CGI now, this movie was just EXCELLENT! People, order this movie! This is a Great movie, directed by YUEN WOO PING . Also as a bad guy, HWANG JING MING fits the role to a TEE. If it only had JACKIE CHAN in the lead role, this movie would have been that much better! I recommend this movie. This is one of those movies where I said I'd buy it later, and I did, but sold it when I got broke. But now I bought it, and enjoyed it, and WON'T sell it this time! lol But seriously, this is a great movie. I recommend it! Plus it has SEAN YOUNG! lol This is one of those movies where I said I'd buy it later, and I did, but sold it when I got broke. But now I bought it, and enjoyed it, and WON'T sell it this time! lol But seriously, this is a great movie. I recommend it! Plus it has SEAN YOUNG! lol I love PLASTIC MAN!!! I feel like I'm in My P.J's on a Saturday Morning way back when! ""Based on The PLASTIC MAN Comic...."" I don't know if Baby Plas is on it, though. He was Sooooo Cute! I just got this Great DVD Today, and I just LOVE IT! I agree with The Lady that said, ""This is what Us Comicbook Geeks see when We read Comics!"" Hats off to John Cassaday and The Legendary Neal Adams for making this Dvd happen. 5 GOLD STARS!!! I LOVE this show, a great memory of Yesteryear (lol), and a sweet memory of Saturday mornings! It was first on SHAZAM!, then here in her own show. I Highly recommend this dvd! OMG, am laughing so hard, My Face Hurts! This is what You need if You are Lonesome for some Good Ol' Side-Splitin' Belly Aches!!! You MUST SEE the Ollie ""MMMMM !!!"" And Stan's ""C'mere ""are a MUST!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD SET!!!! 10 STARS!!!! I bought this series for my sister's b-day, she liked them, I guess. But now I'M buying them for ME! I started watching when it was on t.v. and loved it. Actually I fell in love with EMILY VANCAMP!!! I like ARCHIE COMICS, also the cartoons, but NEVER heard of THIS series. So when I found this set at THE AWESOME PRICE, I HAD to buy them! And, to My delight, I LOVE THEM! I Would definetly say BUY THIS DVD set!!! Until now, I haven't even thought about THE INHUMANS, since I bought AMAZING ADVENTURES, where they co-starred in the book. I most remember NEAL ADAMS as the Artist, so when I saw THIS, I had to get the DVD, not having gotten the original run, so 2 birds, right? I bought this DVD for my little baby kitty, BABY, because she ABSOLUTELY LOVES watching the BIG CATS on TV. I think she lives through the DVD. Oh, and my baby kitty BABY is a Orange Tabby/Maine Coon Cat, she;s SOOO TINY, unlike her BROTHERS, that ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE MAINE COON CATS~!!! I love this show, but got it online for REAL CHEAP, and the quality is just what I expected. Every episode, even The GREEN HORNET ones with KATO. But I'd NEVER pay THIS AMOUNT. Sorry, but I'm satisfied with My DVD's. This is PEANUTS as I always saw them, in my head that is! Over the years I enjoyed this cartoon, and each time I watched a story was always like Saturday morning, eating a bowl of LIFE cereal! Buy this dvd!!! This is THE WORST movie I have EVER seen. Jackie Chan should kick his own ass for this misleading movie. Aside of cameos by Jackie and a couple of other stars, this is a STEAMING PILE OF CRAP, and should be avoided like the plague. Purchase at your own risk! This being THE LAST of ""The Comic Book "" movies, was REALLY GOOD. I never finished reading this Story arc in Real Comic Book time, but it was like reading them. I would definitely recommend these ""COMIC BOOK MOVIES"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A47JUII09O9P3," This is a fun and happy movie to watch on any occasion. It reminds me of my childhood and i look forward to sharing that with my child in the future as wwell This is a cute family movie For anyone who loves the first 2 movies as well as any dog lovers. It's hard to find family movies without much violence and this is a great one for all ages. This is a great movie! Very unique storyline and a lot of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seats. The movie has a lot of action and is a lot of fun to watch! Great movie! A little cheesy in some parts but so creative! The make up is great and the actors did a good job as well. Ito one of the movies that people love or hate and i love it. It's a classic. Great movie. Clint Eastwood in a thriller. What's not to like about that?  Lots of great actors and lots of twists and turns. A fun movie and great for any collection. This is a great story and written beautifully.  All kids will love to watch this and I loved it so much that I bought  it myself. The voices are great and the sonew are very catchy and beautiful!  Great movie! This is a wonderful and creative goofy movie. The cgi is great aND it is a lot of fun to see all of the different types of creatures they came up with. It'snot a movie to be taken seriously. ..just one when you are in the mood for something fun. Such a funny show! The show gets 5 stars..however the packaging gets a 2. All the dvds are stacked together between paper pieces. I'm worried they will get scratched in no time. I would have paid a tad more for better cases. Great show though for a great price. After seeing the packaging, i now know why the price was so low. My husband and I love this show. It is a shame that they stopped it at season 5. SEasons 3 to 5 are so expensive but I looked EVERYWHERE for weeks and amazon was the best price. My husband and I love this show. It is a shame that they stopped it at season 5. SEasons 3 to 5 are so expensive but I looked EVERYWHERE for weeks and amazon was the best price. Very funny movie! Adult topics so not a child movie but one of the funniest movies I have watched in a very long time. The acting was wonderful and I NEEDED it for my collection! It wI'll be watched again and again! This was a very good movie! It was a lot better than most of the movies made today. The cgi was very good and it was very suspenseful.  I enjoyed it a lot and am glad I purchased this item for my collection. I bought this set to watch the story of us. It was not available in amazon streaming. I have seem head over heels which is a cuse movie for a girls night or a cold winter day. Who could go wrong with girly romantic comedies? I bought this for haunted mansion and tower of terror.  I've never seen the frog movie and the country bears isn't my favorite.  My son liked it though. That movie is more for the kids , while the first 2 I mentioned are great for family movie nights and would grow with the child. Great set for a great price! These movies are a great deal! Mary poppins looks Sooo great on blu ray. It is a blu ray must! Saving mr. Banks is a wonderful movie as well and I look forward to a lot of family movie nights with these. This was a gift and when they saw it they were in love. All of the great movies on blu ray. How could you go wrong? Great gift and great price. These are very fun movies. I was looking for a movie for all ages and this was perfect. It has lots of fun and entertaining parts for both children and adults Which is very hard to find now a days. These are very fun movies.

I loved it. Yes it about a witch hunter but if you like witch movies, action mixed with a bit of supernatural this is for you. Will watch again in the future. Peanuts movie is a very good family movie. Nothing inappropriate and engaging for young and old viewers. This was the first movie with snoopy that my kids watched amd loved it. Wonderful!!!!!! I watched this as a child and wanted my children to be able to see it as well. So glad I found it and now my kids will be able to share the same memories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A14ZLQAJI6AAM1," This story is a favorite of mine Harrison Ford as P.O.T.U.S. versus one of movies all time bad guys in Gary Oldman who will in this ultimate winner take all plenty of twists and turns great family movie gotta have it very coveted This story celebrates the history of the Lakota Sioux Nation the conglomeration of elements (the Sioux, their history, their territory) Kevin Costner told their story from their prospective and unlike most writers didn't lose the essence of the story because up to this point he didn't let his ego get in the way thats why so many movies don't translate from books like this one to busy to sensationalize instead of telling the story This video shows the trappings of Hollywood how everyone is trying to use everyone else how far will you go to be a star it shows why so many in Hollywood are so out of touch with society because so many live soap operatic lives when is enough enough This video shows the trappings of Hollywood how everyone is trying to use everyone else how far will you go to be a star it shows why so many in Hollywood are so out of touch with society because so many live soap operatic lives when is enough enough This movie arrived as advertised in excellent condition and during the established time frame. It is also the pilot for all of the series if you are a Sci-fy and a fan of Stargate TV series you will love this movie excellent for families very satisfied and glad to add to my library will be doing future business The story of the Black Officers being allowed into the fray of World War II for years it wasn't even acknowledged in history and the facts are Blacks have fought and died in every since Crispus Attackus died during the Revolutionary War plenty want to act as if blacks have nothing vested in blood and sacrifice for freedom of this nation too bad a real education for us all This video is partially historic of how war was before CNN not politically correct the truth about strategy, science and the realization of war and its influences on society the good and the bad not really for children but sort of a Larry Mc Murtry's telling of the middle ages step one find a great script step two find a great director step three put Samuel L. Jackson on screen with Tommy Lee Jones step four film step five put in theaters step six make lots of money nuff said One of the ultimate action movies they molded the original with the modern version and just to show how amazing the movie was when original cast members made cameos definitely the cherry on top R. I. P. original Jim Street Robert Urich we miss u. The cast, direction, etc... were all outstanding a great family movie u definitely need this one Hollywood didn't like this video but it had some good messages that you can set goals and accomplish them and at any time the hunted can become the hunter this is a good family movie This video is a sequel of a movie made in the '70s about the evolution of sports into a post modern world of the ultimate gladiatorial game very true to the original James Caan will be proud of the sequels This is the story of two men one an up and coming Diver and the other a well respected seasoned Navy Diver on the decline ones challenge to become a Navy Diver the other what do you do when you can't dive any more Based on the actual accounts of Master Chiefs Carl Brashear and Leslie William Sunday this is an outstanding family favorite This movie is one of the best of all time outstanding cast, script, and direction M. Night Shyamalan is a genius the best part of the movie was after the movie when the audience walked out after realizing that this movie was based on a true story and the audience left TOTALLY silent if you haven't seen this movie its a must for your entire family Angelina has a cult classic and following in the Lara Croft series even kids 20 years from know will know about Lara Croft glad to have this one in my library Not often are sequels better than originals but in this case it is true this was the leading role that put Samuel L. Jackson on the map for now this is his signature role outstanding cast, story, etc... John Singleton as director gets the best out of his cast and crew Denzel received the award for Training Day, but this was the movie that he actually earned the award for it came out the same year and was a much better movie. Training Day was something people could fathom but EVERYONE embraces having a sick loved one and doing what ever it takes to help them Drumline arrived in pristine condition during estimated time frame and as advertised this is an excellent slice of black culture in the south this shows how black colleges compete with the Harvard's of the world the black colleges have to be creative to draw capitol and students. It also shows how a boy becomes a man and how making good decisions can benefit you in the long run Antonio Banderas versus Lucy Liu plus action, adventure, and lots of explosions very entertaining this is a lot of fun shows you a lot about the world of assassins glad to add to my library This video is about a young mans trip to europe experiencing their culture and his journey into adulthood as well as the mistakes along the way this movie is primarily for adults Normally sequels don't out perform the originals no offense to Vin Diesel but State of the Union with Cube as XXX Perfect script, cast, direction. Wilem Dafoe as the bad guy and Peter Strauss as the President no contest Angelina has a cult classic and following in the Lara Croft series even kids 20 years from know will know about Lara Croft glad to have this one in my library Were looking for this for years takes a little luster of the military at the time some of what the government doesn't want u to know this DOES NOT speak for the majority of the military whom serve honorably and proudly but this is an aspect that needs to be addressed also",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A39VX0NJB4F4R4," love this movie and felt it was one of Harrison Fords best, although it would not have been without Gary Oldmans superbe antignistic role of the bad guy.  Oldman is a surperb actor in every role I have seen him play.  :Love any movie that has a patriotic theme and ""Air Force One"" fits that description I was mystified by the book, ""Day of the Jackal"" when I read it some years ago.  Got so engrossed that read it in one sitting.  When the movie came out, I beat a line to the theatre to watch Edward Fox play a cunning Jackal out to assinate Charles DeGall.  The movie was well done and had some of Englands finest actors in it. Entertaining and intriguing all the way through.  Loved the way she got even with him but sorry they lost their dream of owning a home that they had worked so hard to fix up.  Good movie I have always been interested in how converted socalists viewed capitalists.  Any Rand in her book, ""The Fountainhead"" leaves no doubt that she believes an individual has a copyright to, not only their inventons, but to their ideas, individuality of thoughts, and philisophies.  I agree with her and everything said by the architect in the courtroom scene where he defends himself.  I think Gary Cooper was a fine actor for his day but Fountaine leaves me cold. Deceived was ordered from Amazon but the seller was MovieMars.  When the DVD was placed in the recorder, the notice came up on the screen:  Eject Disc  --  Will not play in your region.  I put it back in the package and sent it back to the sender and that is the last I heard of it.  DID NOT LIKE THIS! Love ""Shining Through""  Douglas and especially Melanie Griffith did a good job showing another side of womens efforts in WWII besides the women who built the planes, ships, tanks, and equipment our soldiers used in what I consider the most important war of modern times. Brilliant acting by Keifer Sutherland.  I do not know how he kept from getting an Oscar for his role.  Sally Fields did an excellent job and so did Ed Harris and Fanning.  Gripping and thrill after thrill.  Really enjoy the movie. ""Somewhere In Time"" what a love story.  I think Jane Seymore and Christopher Reeves did a very good job.  The music was beautiful and enhanced the acting.  I love this movie.  Glad to have, Somewhere In Time, in my collection of the best (in my opinion) As almost everyone else in the world I was caught up in this case from the beginning.  Scott was my suspect from the beginning although I kept an open mind for a brief period.  I would give anything to know just exactly what happened that triggered Lacys murder on Christmas eve morning or the night before.  It was a good movie but the Amber Frey flick on TV was bettert.

A2TRR8VUVHWTM1," Air Force One is a good action movie with great actors.  It's a predictable movie, but still very fun to watch and pass the time.  If you're looking for a good family movie or are a strict parent with what your kids can watch then I highly recommend this movie.  There's mild violence and mild language, but still fun to watch and own. Dazed and Confused is a great cult classic coming of age movie with a superb cast.  You will love every moment of this movie if you've seen it or not, young or old.  I highly recommend buying this. This is a pretty good psychological thriller.  It has great actors in it too.  I recommend buying it if you like movies like that.  If you're unsure about buying it right away then you should probably rent it first, then decide.  Robert Downey Jr. plays a great psycho.  He may have had troubles years ago, but I will definitely watch anything he's in (you should too) because he's always that good. American Beauty is a great movie about how life can be sometimes.  It's a great dark comedy and probably Kevin Spacey's best performance ever.  I'll admit it's a little depressing in some parts, but it keeps you watching because you need to know what happens.  If you like movies with several storylines and like dark comedies that are a little slow, but really good then I highly recommend buying this and watching it. If you're a Kevin Costner fan or a big golfer yourself then you definitely need to watch this movie.  This is the best Golf movie ever!  It's got everything a person needs.  It's got hilarious lines/jokes, romance, and not to mention the great actors in it. I highly recommend anybody and everybody buy this movie.  Robert Downey Jr. gives a stellar performance alongside Andrew McCarthy and Jami Gertz.  It's a very dark dramatic movie, but definitely worth your time and money if you're into great movies like this. If you're a big Michael Jackson fan then I highly recommend buying this.  I watched it many times as a kid and absolutely loved it and still love it!  It's a bit cheesy, but still REALLY great!  Buy this immediately if you like Michael Jackson. I highly recommend buying this movie if you like romantic comedies.  Drew Barrymore and Justin Long are hilarious together, not to mention everybody else.  If your boyfriend or husband thinks this looks dumb then they're definitely missing out.  You can't stop laughing during this movie.  I guarantee it! Demolition Man is one of the best sci-fi movies in my opinion.  It has a cheesy storyline, cheesy jokes, but at the same time it all fits in perfectly with everything else.  I recommend this fun, funny, action packed movie to everybody who likes movies like this.  Sandra Bullock will make you laugh throughout the entire movie too! Stallone, Banderas, and Moore make this a very fun movie to enjoy.  There's action from beginning to end.  It's a bit cheesy and predictable, but very much worth your time and money.  Buy it and enjoy! I thought this was going to be a good suspenseful horror movie, but it's definitely not.  In fact it's just the opposite.  There's quite a few good actors in this movie, but it gets long and boring.  I wouldn't recommend this movie.  You can definitely find something better to watch. This movie is very good.  I would recommend it to anybody who likes a good drama.  It has a few funny parts.  The movie is pretty short, but excellent.  Robert Downey Jr. is definitely one of Hollywood's most underappreciated actors along with Leonardo Dicaprio. Samson (Daniel Roebuck) Is a crazy teenager who kills a girl down by the river.  He then goes to school and tells everybody what he did.  Nobody believes him until they go look and see he really did it.  For some stupid reason Layne (Crispin Glover) wants to get him out of town instead of doing the right thing and turning him in.  This movie blows!  Don't waste your time and money on the it. A great movie to watch.  This movie reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Erin-Brockovich/dp/B00003CXFV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Erin Brockovich</a>&nbsp;which is also a really good movie.  I highly recommend this movie to people who care about our environment.  After watching this movie, I started wondering if there are still places like this in our country, but don't hear about it. I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you're looking for a drama.  I liked it, but probably won't see it again unless there's nothing else on.  I still gave it 3 star because it's pretty good to see once at least plus the acting is pretty good. Don't buy this movie.  It's absolutely horrible along with the acting.  I heard this movie was bad, but had to see for myself.  It's fun to see how actors get a start and how they end up in other movies together, but that's about the only interesting thing about this movie.  I definitely don't recommend this to anybody, but if you're like me and need to see it for yourself then consider yourself warned. American Wedding is another great sequel in this trilogy.  I never cared to watch the others that were made except the first four.  Everybody came back for this one as well except for Chris Klein 'Oz' Ostreicher and  Mena Suvari as Heather. This is a great slow drama movie for those who like that genre.  There's great acting by Natalie Portman and Zach Braff who also wrote and directed the movie.  A young Jim Parsons in it too.  I recommend this movie because we all don't know how to handle life sometimes.  After watching this you will definitely have food for thought afterwards. Movies that are based on true events or a true story make the movie even better.  Especially if they're done right.  I thought this movie was done really well.  After watching it, I had to read more about it.  It has great actors in it also.  I highly recommend this movie. This movie is brilliant!  It reminds me of that movie Mystery Date with Ethan Hawke which is also another good movie.  Keanu Reeves and Lori Loughlin work really well together.  This movie is very funny also and pretty kid friendly if you're looking for a good family movie.  I highly recommend this movie. If you're a history buff then I recommend this movie to you.  This is a good historical movie about how Hitler wanted to be a really great artist, but didn't realize that he actually was until the end of the movie.  If you aren't into history then I wouldn't recommend this because it can get long and boring in spots. This is definitely a great revenge movie.  There's something about a revenge  movie that keeps you sucked in and watching on edge the entire time.  I'd like to say more, but don't wanna give anything away.  Vin does a good job in this movie.  Pick this movie up if you like good cop/revenge movies. I very highly recommend buying this and the other two DVD's.  The episodes on here will definitely make a bad day good.  I promise!  I wish HBO would still show these, but unfortunately they don't.  If you're hesitating on buying these movies, then hesitate no more.  These are definitely worth your time and money many times over. Manic is a great movie.  It's very sad and unnerving in spots, but I would definitely recommend this movie to people who have a strong stomach.  The performances by all the actors are really good.  I might of changed the ending to be different for me, but the way it ends isn't bad.  I highly recommend this movie, but it would be a hard one to watch very often. After The Sunset is a fun movie I highly recommend to anybody.  It's a fun con movie with great actors and a good story.  It's predictable, but will keep you watching because of the chemistry between all the characters and story.  It's definitely worth your tima and money. This movie is very good.  I would recommend it to anybody who likes a good drama.  It has a few funny parts.  The movie is pretty short, but excellent.  Robert Downey Jr. is definitely one of Hollywood's most underappreciated actors along with Leonardo Dicaprio. This is a fair movie.  The story is actually quite good, but there's a lot missing.  It has pretty good acting, but kids wouldn't really do this by themselves.  I would recommend this movie, but only if you can't find something else.  The thing that really bothered me is that their aren't any parents in this movie except one. Don't waste your time and money on this one.  I bought it because I love horror movies and it got 5.7 stars on IMDB.com.  This may have been good a long time ago, but it's really quite horrible and you'll definitely find yourself asking for your time and money back if you can actually finish it. Karla is a descent movie.  It's based on a true story which makes you want to see the entire thing, but you can probably find something better to watch.  Laura Prepon and Misha Collins do a really great acting job.  I would recommend this movie, but it does get a little long after a while. Chaos is another good Jason Statham movie.  This has good twists and turns during the whole movie that you don't see coming.  I recommend this movie if you're into a good twisty cop movie. This is a superb movie.  It's also a big eye opener!  I had no idea that this stupid stuff really happens to the ones protecting our country.  It's really sad, but I'm glad somebody made a movie about this to show what's going on that nobody really knows about.  I highly recommend this movie to everybody.

It's really sad, but I'm glad somebody made a movie about this to show what's going on that nobody really knows about.  I highly recommend this movie to everybody. This movie blows!  The only good part in the entire movie is Shannon Elizabeth's 5 minutes of fame.  If you love poker and texas hold 'em movies then don't watch this one!  If you want two good ones to watch then definitely check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rounders-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0002DRDB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rounders (Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lucky-You/dp/B000TNLZ0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lucky You</a>&nbsp;Rounders is a really great Poker movie and Lucky You is a good 2nd place finish.  Don't waste your money on Deal! The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a really good movie if you haven't seen it.  It's a shame Heath Ledger passed away before finishing the movie, but the way they finished this movie was done incredibly well.  I have watched this movie several times and enjoy it more each time I watch it.  I would recommend this movie to pretty much everybody except people who get confused easy. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but it's all in subtitles!  I don't mind some, but having them through the entire movie got annoying and made my eyes SUPER tired!  I would recommend this if you don't mind reading through movies, but don't recommend it if you're like me and don't wanna read through your movies and get tired. This DVD is a must own for great laughs!  Terry Fator might be the best ventriloquist out there.  He's incredibly talented!  This DVD will definitely make a bad day go away.  If you're ever in Vegas and wanna see a great show then I highly recommend you go see him because he's even better live! This movie is really good with an All-Star cast.  I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes a good drama.  It's sad, but good.  I don't want to say too much about this movie because it can be spoiled pretty easily, but the acting by everybody is really good. This is a really good coming of age movie that I recommend to anybody even if you aren't a teen anymore.  There are some really hilarious parts in this movie, but the story is what makes this movie good.  I highly recommend buying this movie.  You will definitely watch it several times every so often. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is a fair movie.  It actually grabs your attention and does a pretty good job of keeping you interested until the end.  The ending is really bad and will leave you disappointed and saying to yourself ""That's it!?""  I don't recommend this movie. If you're a Michael Jackson fan then you must definitely buy this!  It shows everything Michael was planning to do for his concerts in London before passing away.  His music and dance moves are still really fun to watch.  This is a must own!  You don't even need to watch it.  Listening to it is fun by itself. If you haven't seen or heard great things about this movie then you have been missing out!  I highly recommend this to everybody who loves a really good crude hilarious movie.  Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler make a perfect comedy duo.  Don't wait any longer to see this if you haven't already.  It's definitely a must own that you will make your friends and family watch after you do. This is a great movie that really shows how Robert De Niro can play any role given to him.  I recommend this movie to everybody who likes just a good feel good movie.  It's slow, but very good and definitely worth your time and money. If you're into good twisty movies that leave you guessing at the end then I highly recommend this.  It has great actors and in my opinion it is definitely worth your time and money.  I'd love to write more about this movie, but I don't want to because I don't want to ruin it.  Just buy it! This movie will make you laugh from beginning to end.  Hill and Tatum are a good duo working together.  I can't wait to see the sequel this summer.  If there's one thing that bothered me or one thing I would change, is replacing Rob Riggle.  That guy is not funny at all. I highly recommend that everybody watch this movie at least once.  This is very heartwarming and funny throughput the entire movie.  You might be thinking the story sounds cheesy, but it's definitely not.  This movie isn't just a chick flick.  Many guys including myself thought it was great.  Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel are a great duo together. If you're a Terry Fator fan like me, don't buy this movie.  I bought it thinking it would be like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-from-Las-Vegas/dp/B002JIIKV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live from Las Vegas</a>&nbsp;It's definitely not and is a horrible buy.  This movie is just a documentary about ventriloquists and their journeys.  Don't waste your money on this. Safe House is a really good movie that keeps you drawn in the entire time wondering what's going to happen.  Ryan Reynolds is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors.  Green Lantern wasn't very good, but he did really good in this movie alongside Denzel Washington.  This movie has many twists that you don't see coming.  I definitely recommend this movie to everybody.  The story is really good. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a fun movie to watch and pass the time.  The first Ghost Rider is still better, but I'm not knocking this one like everybody else because it's still fun to watch.  The 3D version is pretty cool to see also. American Reunion is definitely a good raunchy fun movie.  I definitely recommend this movie to anybody who's looking to pass the time or because you need something to make you laugh.  The people who give this movie 1 star and a bad review need to stop writing reviews and get a life and not take things so seriously.  These movies are made to make people laugh and have a good time. Lockout is a really cool action movie that everybody needs.  There's no hard plot to follow.  It's just a great action packed sci-fi movie that'll definitely pass the time.  Guy Pearce is a great walking one liner through the whole movie.  This movie is definitely worth your time and money if you're looking for a fun action movie. The original Total Recall is still a fun classic movie to watch, but this new one is way better.  It's a little darker and grittier then the original, but that's probably why I like it better.  If you like good action, good twists, and good actors then this movie is definitely for you! Parker is another great Jason Stratham action packed movie.  I recommend this to everybody who likes endless action, hot girls, and an easy storyline that doesn't take much thinking.  If you don't like movies like this then it's not for you and you shouldn't be reading these reviews to help you decide This movie was much better then I originally expected.  John Cusack and Alice Eve do a really good job together.  The movie isn't scary, but the movie draws you in and keeps you drawn in until it's over.  I recommend this movie to people who like movies that aren't scary, but keep you enticed until the end. Johnny Depp does a great job in this movie.  This movie will keep you very entertained from beginning to end.  It's very funny and if Hunter S. Thompson were alive today he would be proud of how it turned out.  Don't hesitate to buy this! Don't waste your time on this movie.  This movie has good actors, but the plot is really predictable and won't surprise you at the end.  They tried to make a twisty ending to make you say ""WOW!  I didn't see that coming!""  However they failed at that.  Find a different movie to watch. Kick-Ass 2 is absolutely hilarious!  If you're a fan of the first one then I highly recommend you pick this one up too.  The first one is still my favorite, but this one is really awesome.  Definitely worth buying because you'll watch it many times. I didn't like this movie at all.  I didn't realize there's a book though.  I will try reading the book, but will probably have a hard time motivation wise after watching this.  I found this movie to be really slow and somewhat dumb because aliens can't become human.  This movie has great potential, but starts falling apart 30 minutes into it. This is a great movie definitely worth your time and money.  It's very predictable, but a must see.  We all choose our own destiny in life and can prove to others that we can change from being the person we use to be, or grow up right when your family doesn't think you can.  Buy it or rent it, but it's a definite must see. I recommend this movie.  It has a pretty good plot and good actors in it.  It's worth buying or renting if you're looking for a good movie to watch over the weekend. This movie is horrible.  It's about trying to get a band together and making it in the 60's, but the movie falls short.  The story gets very drawn out and the acting is very dry and just overall bad.  The music will also get on your nerves after a white too.  They try singing some songs, but do mostly cover songs that are popular at that time.  I don't recommend this movie even if you love music. This movie might have great actors in it, but the movie itself is really pathetic.  The movie had a good dark, gritty feel to it, but the story itself is just downright horrible.  Don't buy this or waste your time renting it either.  If somebody else directed it, it may have better or worse, but that's hard to say for certain.  Avoid this movie at all costs! Fire with Fire is a pretty good movie that went straight to DVD that not many people probably heard about.  I really enjoy a good revenge movie, but then again who doesn't?  I recommend this movie because the story is good and it also has a good cast. 42 might be one of the best movies of the year.  I couldn't believe how badly people treated Jackie Robinson.  He overcame so much in his life when he didn't have to.  Everybody young or old should watch this.  I sure hope it wins an Oscar or two.  Definitely buy this movie! Don't buy this.  I'm  REALLY bummed they made 2 and 3 after the original was SO hilarious.  Don't buy this or the second one if you're thinking about it.  I won't keep either sequel and neither should you unless you really like this more dark, gross out humor.  What a waste of time and money. One of the best surfing movies told.  Gerard Butler and up and coming star Jonny Weston tell the true story of Jay Moriarity and Frosty Hesson.  I'm sure Hollywood jazzed the story up a bit, but who cares.  This is a great movie for the whole family to watch together.  It's definitely worth owning so buy it already! Robot and Frank is a great movie I recommend to everybody, especially if you're looking for a good family movie.  This is funny, sad, and very heartwarming all at the same time.  I highly recommend this movie.  I know this review is short, but I don't want to give anything away.  Don't hesitate to buy or rent if you don't like buying movies. Ron Howard does it again.  I highly recommend this movie to everybody!  I definitely think this could have won an Oscar for best picture, but it never even got nominated!  Don't spend your time wondering if you should buy it or wonder if it's any good.  This movie is definitely worth your time and money I guarantee it!  There's great acting by everybody who was cast in it.  You better RUSH out and get this immediately. Upside Down is a really cool CGI movie with a great romantic story.  Jim Sturgess and Kirsten Dunst seemed to work very well together.  I know you probably read or saw the previews and thought to yourself ""It's just another movie about the rich and poor, but done in a different setting.""  It sort of is, but it's actually very entertaining and the story is very good.  I recommend this to everybody. This DVD is all about Arnel Pineda and his ""Journey"" it took to be the new lead singer for Journey.  It's absolutely amazing to see how he went from being homeless and starving on the streets of Manila to Youtube sensation then to joining the band.  I highly recommend this documentary to any Journey fan or music lover out there. The Numbers Station has to be one of the most boring movies made!  I'm really surprised John Cusack did this movie.  There probably wasn't more than five pages of a script to read.  The acting in this movie is really dry, (bad) the movie is pretty dark in a lot of spots, and the sound will drive you crazy too because it goes back and forth between quiet and really loud throughout the movie.  Find something else to watch. Stoker is a fair movie.  It's very predictable from beginning to end.  Some of the movie grabs you and gets you really drawn in, but then let's you go.  You keep waiting for the movie to draw you back in again, but get left disappointed and then the movie is over before you know it leaving you disappointed again.  Don't waste your time and money on this. This is a really good foreign movie that has good twists and turns throughout the movie.  I highly recommend it for those who like these genres.  You also get to see lots of Rosario Dawson in this movie.  She's absolutely gorgeous! John Travolta and Robert De Niro either needed a rent check or just needed something to do.  This movie is absolutely horrible.  The acting is bad, the story is bad, and everything else you can think of that you like in a movie is bad here.  You also have to listen to John Travolta's Goldmember accent through the entire movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie.  It's based on a true story, but it's pretty bad.  The acting is really bad and the movie makes you yell ""C'mon!"" ""These cops are really dumb and slow.""  Definitely not worth your time and money. This is a great coming of age movie for everybody except maybe minors due to the content and graphic sex/nudity in this movie.  I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a very underappreciated actor/director.  I highly recommend this movie.  The acting in this movie by everybody is very well done too.  Rent it or buy it because it's definitely worth your time and money. I highly recommend this movie to everybody.  I admit this movie is a little slow and there's not much to the storyline, but this movie will entice you from the very beginning.  Their are a ton of great actors in this movie.  Woody Harrelson is probably one of the best actors to play a bad guy.  I will definitely watch this again several times over in the next couple months. I'm extremely glad this movie didn't win best picture.  It definitely did deserve all the awards for special effects, but the storyline itself was pretty bad.  I recommend renting this movie and enjoying it with the family, but that's it.  I don't plan on keeping this movie on my shelves. This movie is absolutely horrible!  It's very predictable from beginning to end.  The acting is really bad too.  I thought it was going to be really good because of the trailer I watched, but it wasn't even close.  I wouldn't recommend this to anybody because it'll be time lost that you can't ever get back. I was very disappointed in this movie.  I kept hearing that this is Robert Redford's best performance in years, but it's definitely not.  The movie starts out very intriguing and really good, but then after the other ships don't see him or his flares right by them, then that's when you start losing interest and get bored.  (At least that's how I felt.)  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody who needs action or something else. If you're a music lover then you definitely need to see this movie.  I love seeing how bands get discovered and how they became famous.  I very highly recommend this to everybody even if you're not the biggest music lover.  This movie is done really well.  The story telling and acting is very good.  Please buy this movie or rent it.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend this movie if you're buying it or renting it.  I don't want to say too much about it because it'll give too much away too easily.  It's a fun family movie though.  Very hilarious, especially in certain spots. Captain Phillips is a good movie, but could've been better.  This movie is good and I would recommend watching it, but probably not buying it.  I think they adapted the film well from what I remember hearing when this happened, but the movie could have been a little shorter while telling the story just as they did. Prisoners is a great movie that I recommend to everybody.  It's a slow movie, but grabs you and doesn't let you go.  The very ending cuts off where you don't want it to, but all in all this is a great suspenseful thriller.  I highly recommend buying it or renting it. Joaquin Phoenix does a stellar job in this movie.  I loved this movie because it's very funny in spots and sad too.  I recommend this movie to everybody.  It's a little slow, but at the same time it entices you to keep watching to see how it ends.  I definitely recommend buying this. Homefront is a superb suspense thriller that I highly recommend to everybody.  I don't think I have ever seen Jason Statham in a bad movie.  The only movie of his I didn't like was Blitz.  Blitz is good, but a little boring.  Anyway, this movie is very good with a great cast -James Franco.  It's definitely worth your money and time if you're debating if you should buy it or not. You know you're acting career is over when you were once king of the mountain and now you can't do anything good anymore.  The movie is very predictable and lacts any good acting.  I don't recommend this movie to anybody unless you like bad low budget movies.  Find something else to watch. Night Moves is a very good movie based on a true story.  Jesse Eisenberg and Dakota Fanning do a great job working together.  I would recommend this movie, but probably not to buy.  It's pretty slow and you will find yourself wondering how much longer until it's over, but you won't turn it off because you will keep wondering what happens at the end. This movie is complete trash.  I can't believe they actually made this movie.  The storyline is awful and the acting is really bad too.  Don't waste your time and money on this one.  Why people rate this movie so highly will always remain a mystery to me.  Don't waste your time and money on this dumb movie.  I guarantee you'll be dissatisfied if you buy or rent this. What a bummer to be one of Robin William's last movies.  I definitely thought this movie was going to be hilarious, but it wasn't even close.  I chuckled at a few parts, but that was it.  Everybody almost tried too hard to be funny and it backfired horribly.  I don't recommend this movie unless you want to watch it because of Robin Williams. Foxcatcher is a superb movie.  Steve Carrell is absolutely a great villain who portrays John du Pont.  This movie will suck you in from the very beginning.  You won't believe the stuff John du Pont puts his wrestlers through, esecially Mark Schultz. (Channing Tatum)  This movie is very good and also very sad.  I would recommend this to anybody who doesn't mind a really good slow drama.  If you don't like dramas, you will still really like this movie. I'm really bummed this movie sucked SO bad!  There's so many great actors in this movie, but man, this movie would be better blank.  I didn't like the 70's style they put this movie in.  I think it might have been better if they shot it like it was 2014.  The acting is horrible by everybody and the story gets confusing after awhile too.  I wouldn't recommend this to anybody. This movie is absolutely hilarious and very well done!  It's not done poorly like those stupid Scary Movie's the Wayan brother's did. I recommend this movie to anybody who likes a good parody of a classic horror movie.  I know this review is really short, but I don't want to ruin the fun and the story.  Buy or rent, but I guarantee you will have a a good times watching this! This movie is a complete waste of time and money.  I liked the idea of humans and dinosaurs ruling the same planet, but we all know how long humans would really last.  Don't bother wasting your time and money on this movie.  The story is just flat out dry and boring. I feel bad for once upon a time great actors like Bruce Willis.  Either he's really bored or needs a paycheck really bad.  Gina Carano (Angel Dust from Deadpool) is in it too.  This movie starts out really intriguing and suspenseful, but then loses all that about 20 minutes later.  This movie will lose you very quickly because it becomes very predictable.  I don't recommend this movie to anyone.  You're better off finding something else. I'm really surprised this movie didn't have a better storyline.  There are great actors in this movie, but the movie is horrible and so is the acting.  Don't waste your time and money on this.  If you're into gambling movies then I highly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rounders-Blu-ray/dp/B0055OTJPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rounders [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lucky-You/dp/B000TNLZ0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lucky You</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino/dp/B0019IMVDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino</a>. These movies are great to own on DVD.  It sure takes me back to my childhood when I watched them a ton.  I recommend these movies to anybody and young kids growing up.  I really can't wait for the third one to be made.  It should be really awesome! I'm a huge horror fan, but this movie is really horrible!  Please don't waste your time and money on this movie.  I know you can definitely find something better to watch. This movie is actually pretty descent.  It's not the best, but definitely not the worst for a movie that went straight to DVD.  I would recommend this movie if nothing else is on.  It sure passed the time and kept me entertained wondering what was going to happen even though it's predictable. Please don't waste your time and money on this horribly lame movie.  I'm ashamed I bought this thinking it would be a fair horror movie.  If you like bad movies that are so bad it's actually a little funny then you might enjoy this.  The effects aren't that impressive at all.  Abort buying this or renting at all costs. This movie is a complete waste of time and money.  This movie is 72 minutes long, but will bore the living daylights out of you.  I'm pretty sure this movie is about bad business between friends, but don't really know because it flashes back and forth so often that you lose track of what's going on and you could care less.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3VPNLGKCAQZZA," Hey I love disaster flicks and this was worth the wait to have it on Blu-Ray. We have a 7.1 sound system and the effects are great. This is a great movie to watch when in the mood for disaster flicks. Ok, I give the Brits know how to hook you. This is the 3rd or 4th series I have watched on Amazon.com and I just love this. It doesn't take long before it hooks you. If you like period drama's with a touch of history thrown in. You will love this. I love this movie, I just wish it was in HD. For it's time the special effects are great and the movie moves. I love disaster flicks and this is a great one. My husband watched this a few times. He says it was a great coming of age movie. I myself have not watched it so I can't truly rate it based on my experience. But my husband said he really loved it. Hi, I have watched a lot of Ghost Hunter type of shows. If you are into that kind of thing this show is great. They have had some really interesting cases. I personally find the show really interesting. Nothing fake or phony here. This was a great family movie. It touches on a lot of subjects that some of us can relate to. I would watch it again. This movie makes your feel good. My husband watched this a few times. He says it was a great coming of age movie. I myself have not watched it so I can't truly rate it based on my experience. But my husband said he really loved it. Hi, I have watched a lot of Ghost Hunter type of shows. If you are into that kind of thing this show is great. They have had some really interesting cases. I personally find the show really interesting. Nothing fake or phony here. This was a great family movie. It touches on a lot of subjects that some of us can relate to. I would watch it again. This movie makes your feel good. I love this movie, it is a great feel good movie to watch when you need a little lift me up. The picture was sharp and clear. Of course this is all based on your bandwidth that you ISP provided you. We had a great time watching the movie. This is a fun show, especially if you are into this subject. This show is real, nothing fake or phony about it. Now there are no reenactments in the show, but real investigation where the kids get to use their talents, and get support from each other while they do so. I love historical drama's and this had lots of great fight scenes. I had to hand it to the stunt pilots they did a great job. I also was a great biography of a legendary man. I love to watch show that investigate paranormal events. The team on this show are for real, they don't play around, The stuff they investigate is real. If you like these kind of show's I recommend this show. I think this was pretty good. Maybe not as good as Dante's Peak, but it still keeps your interest. And there is lots of special effects. I enjoyed this one and I would watch it again and maybe at some point would buy it. I was glad to see this was available for Prime. I'm hooked and can't wait for more. This is really good, I would recommend it to anyone who like historical period drama's. Well, I have to admit, my friends said I have to watch this show. I saw an episode during a PBS fund raiser and decided to watch the show. I was hooked immediately. I find it interesting to see how things were back then. People are people no matter what the class. But their stories are worth watching. Consider me hooked and I look forward to more episodes. I love this, I was hooked pretty quick. I like the history in this. It may somewhat historical fiction, but it is based on a real person and I find it fascinating to watch. I would recommend this to anyone who like British period drama's This is a great companion to the original NCIS. I'm a Vet and was excited when they came out with this show. I really like it and it is tough to decide which one i like the best. I love disaster flicks, this one is OK. The special effects are acceptable. And the story moves. But you can tell it is low budget. Still a nice movie. I would watch it again, but I don't think I would buy it. I have loved this movie since it first came out. The movie moves quick almost from the start. I was so glad when it was available on Blu-ray. I was only disappointed that there were now special features on this disk. My husband and I love the Tinkerbell movies, This one was another great one to add to the collection. This movie also helped tie together some of the history of the original Peter Pan movie as well. The HD version really makes all the colors and sound Pop. Great movie for the whole family. This was a great period drama, that told a more realistic story of who Dracula was and added some great battle scenes. By the end of the movie I felt sorry for Dracula. I rented this movie, but I would probably buy it now. It kept me on the edge of my seat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A267IXCC7UK1HY," Boring and sentimental memories of one's formative years in Montana.  I kept waiting for something of interest but the experiences were mostly banal, and the nostalgia and philosophizing left me cold.  Is this what is considered good literature today? ludicrous and not funny. . .  The leading characters are very attractive in looks, but the Cinderella story (with comedy scenes like Shaw's Pygmalion) is predictable and totally preposterous without being really entertaining.  Not worth the trouble. Take a subject that has been exhaustively examined numerous times. Add wild speculations. Do crude re-constuctions. Shoot everything out of focus, with endless jerks of the camera, and constant flashbacks. And you get this worthless movie. A powerful expose of sports-as-business. . .  In general, i am not interested in spectator sports--people should be  physically active rather than just watch professionals in competition. But this powerful, fascinating account of the inside of football held my attention. It has memorable characters and it seems very realistic in its combination of the heroic and false of professional sports, where the athletes prostitute their bodies for short-term ""glory"" and pleasure (drugs, alcohol, cigarettes). Quite entertaining in spots but too much below-the-waist humor. . .  In general, i like the Drebin series and i liked this movie, but it had stretches that were silly without being funny, and too much below-the-waist humor. This is one of my all-time favorites. In addition to the beautiful songs, it is the always-moving story of a loving home maintained by the Jewish couple amidst poverty and persecution. Particularly touching is the struggle of the father to reconcile his tradition with the changing conditions of modern life, where children assert themselves and shape their own lives. Don't miss this movie for anything! an incredible string of adventures of a Jewish boy in WW II. . .  the movie takes what should be the experiences of several youths and attaches them to one youngster. The result is an incredible string of close escapes that strikes me as rather comic in its implausibility. The photography is amazing and there is some delightful humor. But we are today (2015) too far removed from the Armageddon visions of fifty years ago and from the Viet Nam era hatred of the ""military-industrial complex"" and so the representation of all US generals as lunatics or warmongers is just silly and absurd. Much, much better than the usual Rohmer movie. . .  This review has a spoiler.  This movie has much less of the typical endless talk by egotists about themselves. The central character finally discovers what a wonderful boyfriend she has--but too late. I am very glad he discovers, before it is too late, that he was throwing his peals before swine. same jokes as in Airplane (the first of the series). . .  The first of the Airplane! series is hilarious. This is just a re-cycling, with the same people and mostly the same jokes and stunts. Moving and beautiful. . .  I suppose its genre is romantic comedy, but there's a wealth of human experience here, some entertaining, some sad, but all well-done and something you don't want to miss. very entertaining, spirited, and clever, with excellent casting. There is not a dull moment. The scenery is fascinating and there is much timely satire of the modern Great Dictators of the desert. Slapstick yes, but enjoyable. The plot is exceptionally clever, lively, and witty, with lots of surprise twists. But unpleasantly there is the very likable Holly Hunter, who ties herself to a complete loser (making herself a loser too), and the sadness for her spoils much of the fun. immensely entertaining. . .  The plot is brilliantly clever, the action is fast paced. The characters are well-cast and likable, including the bad guys and even the FBI.  Don't miss it. An extremely important theme but tedious to watch...  As Birman's lapses and his growing obsession with drink progresses, the movie plods on and on, predictably and very unpleasantly.  The theme is that the unlimited dedication of a loving, infinitely patient woman can save an alcoholic. That theme seems simplistic to me, though i haven't had any personal experience in this area.  But the subject is extremely important and deserves the most attention. Memorable record of a strange episode in La history..,  This is a record of the shenanigans in Louisiana history, almost too weird to be believable. But Paul Newman and Lolita Rabinowitch make the movie very fascinating and, at the end, even moving. Very entertaining.  The lesson of the movie is sound (husbands might just as well be faithful to their wives) but the plot is ingenious and the skits clever. The ending is surprising, and the whole experience is pleasant. Overacted and melodramatic and under-lighted. . .  The story in itself is interesting.  However, I think of this movie as of primarily historical interest. The acting, especially of Anna, is exaggerated, like that of an actor transitioning from one 18th-century theater to the modern age.  I also don't like the fact that his movie is to a large extent shot in semi-dark settings. Not one likable character, thoroughly unpleasant. . .  If you want to know what happened, go to the encyclopedia. The movie is rambling, showing the same unpleasant situations multiple times with multiple interpretations.  A big problem is that none of the characters is pleasant. Dershowitz should be, but he is played in such a hamming, cocky way that he is just as unlikable as the rest. This is an interesting story about a young woman in post-WW2 Germany who insists on exposing the Nazi past of the leading citizens in her home town. It's thought-provoking and serious but with lots of light touches. This is a light-weight, clever treatment of the theme of the seven years' itch. A good, loyal husband is determined to remain that way, but what can you do when your upstairs neighbor is Marylin Monroe, at once as naive and innocent as a child, and as sexy (unaware to herself) as a siren? Lots of fun. Gripping and authentic-seeming. . .  This is a very convincing, chilling account of the uprising that eroded the French colonialism in Algeria. You can oppress and push a people just so far before it rises up against the oppressors. (It would be well for the Israeli occupants of the West Bank to give serious thought to the documentary.)  A must for the student of colonialism. Routine gangster movie, with little logic . . .  Two handsome young man fight their way through cunning and murder to the top of the organized hierarchy in the city. There are no surprises and no charm. Crime first pays very well, and then it doesn't, in a sop to the moralists. Endless silly stunts. Entertaining if that's what you like.  Not particularly creative and certainly not suspenseful. It proceeds from one familiar stunt to another.  I give it three starts because i viewed it for the French, and the subtitles are in brilliant yellow. On the positive side, you may never hear a cello the same way again. It's also one ""arty"" movie where the story is clear and coherent. There's also the interest of seeing the 17th century re-created.  On the negative side, the movie is dismally boring. There is also the annoying mannerism of filming scenes under-lighted (that is, dark). A father goes very much out of his way to establish a close relationship with his neurotic, pathologically lying, troubled daughter. In the end, all works out best and everyone is happy. The only false note is seeing Depardieau strutting around in a swimsuit--he really needs to lose 20 pounds. Still, i enjoyed this father-daughter comedy. This is an excellent thriller. Except for the last 20 minutes, the logic is generally ok (though why does one cop deliberately shoot another?). The camera work is good (not too much blurring and shaking of the camera). The characters are likable. Great stunts. Quite enjoyable.  The last 20 minutes nearly ruin the whole thing. The plot becomes illogical and absurd. That's where the movie lost a star on my ratings. Romantic comedy?  Hardly.  A good-looking young man seduces (is seduced by?) the four daughters of his host. But i don't find anything specially entertaining and certainly nothing significant about this bit of frill. I constantly waited for something to redeem the story but in vain. Looks like a parody of a Bond movie. . .  The action scenes are no better or worse than those of the run-of-the-mill action movies. I would have given it three stars but there are domestic/sexual-parody scenes that are tasteless and boring, so 2 stars. A young woman murders her parents and lets her autistic brother get blamed, which would land him in an institution for the criminally insane for the rest  of this life. When a psychiatrist discovers the truth, she tries to murder him too in a horrifying manner. Her excuse? you go it: her father supposedly abused her sexually. Of course. She is a ""victim"", so it's a slap on the wrist for this murderess. Worthwhile and thoughtful, but extremely slow-moving. . .  The subject is important but the movie is stretched out to make a full-length movie. It should be reduced to half its present length. Why do the French spend a fortune on a story that is horrible and unpleasant, and make it worse by shooting much of it blurred/out of focus? Ils sont fous, ces-genre la! The documentary is an immensely powerful and disturbing record of a mass hysteria case engineered by feminists and ""child advocates"". There can be no question that the whole affair was manufactured by a ""child advocate"" and then swept through by media hysteria and prosecutorial abuse. MUST SEE! Same old formula. . .  Yes, it's full of action and stunts, but once you have seen one, it's easy to get tired of:  o Bruce Willis making faces and cursing in phony frustration o blurred images to generate phony excitement o lights that shine directly into the camera o Willis armed with a pistol and a handful of cartridges confronting a whole shipful of heavily armed terrorists Bizarre and lacking in substance or credibility.  This movie pretends to deal with deep, primitive drives that cause a woman to act irrationally. But the whole thins is weird, starting with a brothel that has 3 prostitutes, one madame, and one maid but seems to be empty most of the time, and ending with an ambiguous, magical conclusion that seems to mean that the director didn't know how to conclude. I assume that the meaning of the movie is that a mentally tortured author commits suicide and is then subjected to an interrogation is a hell-like setting. Is that your reading of the movie? If so, i would raise the rating from one to four stars. This thriller/detective story is one of the very few movies i have ever scored with five stars. Its plot is immensely clever, and the suspense is constant and, toward the end, almost unbearable. Perfect in every way. Excellent, serious, and thoughtful. . .  What do you do when a whole nation endorses the diabolic policies and actions of its elected leader? What do you do with people who think that the most vicious and horrible bestialities are in the service of their country?  The only weakness in the movie is the hysterical acting of the defense attorney. Otherwise this is a superlative movie. a touching, fascinating movie that covered a decade or so of the life of a music teacher who learned to communicate his love of music to his pupils. Definitely, worth watching. . . This is a vulgar caricature. Nixon was a contemptible individual, but he was not a clown or a madman, and no serious self-respecting historian has the right to misrepresent him as such. This movie is obscene. There is also the extremely annoying practice of constantly swinging the camera for no reason, shooting from unusual angles, blurring, switching from black-and-white to color and back, and such like irritating tricks. A thoughtful, worthwhile movie. . .  The courtroom scene is particularly effective.  I assume that the movie was based on true events, but then it would be crazy to run a sailing ship with nearly no experienced adults.  One thing i didn't like was the overly long shipwreck scene, showing people trapped and drowning. I also skipped the killing of the porpoise.  All in all, a very commendable effort. A disappointing remake. I prefer the original with Hepburn.  Story was not much to begin with, but Hepburn's charm made it enjoyable if predictable tale.  The remake uses a homely looking woman, so there is no charm to save the thing. Worthwhile, significant exploration of the inside of a bunch of male losers. . .  The men are immature machistas for the most part, with their lives turning around booze and women, but there are good, touching moments and good acting. Not bad if you don't expect a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Yes, it is vulgar, coarse, crude, stupid--but it is full of spirit and fun, for teenagers of all ages. Excellent acting, infectious farce, politically incorrect disgrace, but at least not boring. clever but much, much too long. . .  The plot is clever, with some surprises along the way.  One weakness is that it is stretched out and goes on and on, as when it discusses the pros and cons of giving in to the kidnappers.  Another weakness is the over-acting and over-dramatizing of two overly emotional immature parents. Slow and predictable, , ,  The photography is a pleasure, the acting is so-so. There is a distinguished cast. The trouble is that there is extremely little plot, and what there is is incredible (a stewardess landing a huge airliner). The only redeeming fact is that this movie provided materials for the parody movie Airline. This is not another GODFATHER. It's an entertaining romantic comedy among Mafiosi. Typical is the exchange between the wife and the husband. The wife remarks that she has saved much money from the pay for murdering five people over the last two (?) years. ""That many?"" the husband asks disapprovingly, and she answers defensively: ""It's not a whole lot, considering the total population"".  It's that kind of humor. Not funny, just mushy. . .  This is supposed to be a romantic comedy. I like this genre, but the story was so predictable and mushy that i could not even force a smile or a chuckle. Yes, it is vulgar, coarse, crude, stupid--but it is full of spirit and fun, for teenagers of all ages. Excellent acting, infectious farce, politically incorrect disgrace, but at least not boring. The Truman Show is, for one thing, a good comedy. There is also a detective-story element, as Truman starts piecing the clues together to come up with an incredible (but as it happens true) theory. And there are the serious implications of privacy and social control. Excellent acting too. I hesitated between 2 and 3 stars. On the negative side, the movie is very slow and pretentious. On the other hand, it raises serious issues about the role of a defense attorney and mental illness. Also there are issues of logic. A very taut, clever, fast-paced thriller. You have it all here: satellite surveillance, cameras hidden everywhere, sound-picking devices, rogue CIA agents, chases eveywhere. There's not a dull moment.  PS: I am lowering the rating one star because much of the photography is out of focus. This is a soap opera set in exotic Indo-China under the French rule. The plot goes on and on, with quite a few touches of melodrama. The only outstanding feature is the amazing re-creation of the period and location, and the marvelous photography. This is a story about an arrested adolescent who tries to understand why he cannot have a healthy, long-term relationship with a woman. The alternation of action and narration (Kusack talking to the camera) is very interesting and unusual a technique, but I confess that I agree with other reviewers, who are bored by the slow pace. I feel sorry for the nice family of Tatie E, the victims of the nasty aunt; and i feel sorry for the dog that gets abandoned, and i feel sorry for myself for watching this questionable dark comedy. I thoroughly enjoyed the second of the three episodes--the expert seducer and the brainless wife. The first and the third were overdrawn and overacted jokes that were not hilarious in themselves and were overdone and unpleasant, not saved by the occasional wit and dead-pan rapid fire delivery. In any case, none of the characters is likable or admirable. A young woman murders her parents and lets her autistic brother get blamed, which would land him in an institution for the criminally insane for the rest  of this life. When a psychiatrist discovers the truth, she tries to murder him too in a horrifying manner. Her excuse? you go it: her father supposedly abused her sexually. Of course. She is a ""victim"", so it's a slap on the wrist for this murderess. The Truman Show is, for one thing, a good comedy. There is also a detective-story element, as Truman starts piecing the clues together to come up with an incredible (but as it happens true) theory. And there are the serious implications of privacy and social control. Excellent acting too. This is an excellent thriller. Except for the last 20 minutes, the logic is generally ok (though why does one cop deliberately shoot another?). The camera work is good (not too much blurring and shaking of the camera). The characters are likable. Great stunts. Quite enjoyable.  The last 20 minutes nearly ruin the whole thing. The plot becomes illogical and absurd. That's where the movie lost a star on my ratings. A caricature of Wall Street and the free-enterprise system. . .  I don't know Wall Street, of course, but the movie seems to be a caricature of the free-enterprise system, with its endless cynicism about ""Capitalism"". This strikes me like a cold-war propaganda piece, not the real thing. A bunch of social parasites feed and drink and dawdle while others less lucky are at the front fighting the Germans. Why would anybody waste his/her time on this depiction of degeneracy? The story is fine but I find the acting terrible. Sean Penn has just one facial expression throughout: a solemn wrinkled forehead and dead pan. Kidman keeps forever getting her hair to cover her right eye. These mannerisms drive me nuts. compelling, suspenseful, unforgettable. . .  This is an extraordinary movie. The plot is taut and fast-paced, the dialog clever, the characters exceptionally acted, with touches of philosophy.  The only flaw is occasionally imperfect logic. Specifically, the cabdriver did have a chance to get away and call the police half-way through. Why didn't he? He could have warned the police of the danger to his mother. This comedy is full of twists and turns. Just the sight of the two main characters, George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones, makes the movie enjoyable. I wonder what other scripts the Coen brothers produced! I was attracted to the movie by all the hoopla, and then terribly disappointed.  A young woman gives up the chance to study law at Stanford. Instead, she becomes a gopher (lower even than a secretary) running menial errands for a bitchy fashion critic. Her motive? Meet the right people! How stupid could she get?  What a waste of her time and mine. A touching record of a love that overcame the man's additions. . .  HERE'S A SPOILER:  It was good to see that June ended up in a stable, apparently happy marriage after she has stood loyally by John Cash during his addiction. And it's good to see the man move on and get over the demons of the past and put his life together. There is something painful in the movie in the circumstance that the company retains an employee just out of reverse discrimination (that is, because they believe that he is gay and so is firing-proof). This is a REAL matter that is happening often--whether the reverse discrimination is against whites, straights, or men.  Apart from this, the movie is entertaining and it has serious and worthwhile scenes amidst the farce. Worth seeing.

Apart from this, the movie is entertaining and it has serious and worthwhile scenes amidst the farce. Worth seeing. The friendship between a black kid and an elderly poor Jew makes for a good, moving story; but the story drags at times, and the segment set in the country club is very heavy-handed and preachy. I give it credit for taking up a demanding theme but the magnetism is not quite there as far as i am concerned, not quite. This is a taut, clever thriller where the detective plays cat and mouse with the criminal and vice versa. I would give it five stars but for the photography: a number of the scenes are shot with the camera unsteady--something that irritates me no end--and the narrative is occasionally interrupted with one-second totally blurry representations of the crime. (This is so gratuitous and irritating I am tempted to penalize it to THREE stars.) Rambling and unpleasant, just like life itself.  A young woman does not know what she wants, and causes unhappiness to everyone around her and to herself. It's not pleasant but i have been asking for serious true-to-life movies, so i should not complain.  i just wonder why the director paired such a lovely woman with such a monumentally ugly husband. This starts as a fantastic thriller of the Agatha Christie model, then switches to fantasy / science fiction. I was disappointed and cheated but I recognize that others may like the switch, and at least I enjoyed the movie up to the switch. Poor adaptation of novel shot out of focus. . .  reasonably good casting and acting, but. . .  o the changes to the novel make the story much, much worse o much of the story is shot out of focus and in a blur. thoughtful and fascinating study of a pathological liar . . .  The acting is good, the story very interesting and authentic-sounding. The focus is always, as it should be, on a pathological liar who, it seems, can't help himself and ruins himself as a result. Moving human story, heart-warming. . .  The casting is superlative, the story is beautiful and heart-warming. There's nothing not to like about this story of an elderly man who lost his son tragically, and a nine-year-old girl discovering the world. The poor little rich girl, how lonely! And it doesn't help that she gets to chauffeur her college friends at the taxpayers' expense on Airforce One (just for the bunch of friends), with Secret Service agents as butlers. Poor little girl!  This is a paparazzi People-magazine type of schmaltz about a poor little rich girl's search for happiness.  How vulgar and silly can you get? Great photography, great performers, great music. . .  The movie has a soap opera element that may or may not work for you. But what is most remarkable is the singing passages. You will never hear them again the same way, they will always have an extra resonance for you. some very suspensful moments but questionable logic. . .  We are to believe that the threat to her father's death is enough to keep a woman from just standing up from her airplane seat and demanding help, and we are to believe that she couldn't just talk to the numerous police on the ground and ask them to telephone the hotel. But if you don't mind the absurdity, the movie is rather suspensful. Some details still puzzle me--e.g, how did the murdered plan to retrieve the hooked rope that enabled him to climb to the floor above? Still, the movie is very suspenseful and clever, and i found it very entertaining. Assuming that this movie is an accurate representation of the Asperger syndrome, it is to recommend for not hiding the fact that the victims cannot become ""normal"". As the woman says, her relationship with her mate may last 20 days or 20 years. The  effect of the movie though is unpleasant, unlike A BEAUTIFUL MIND and RAIN MAN. Reasonably good--for a propaganda film. . .  The strength of the movie is in the character of the mayor of Kolberg though his hysterical daughter and caricaturized son nearly undo his acting.  Not at all as bad as i would have expected from Goebel. The first part of the trilogy is a supreme achievement that should not be missed for anything. This part sentimentalizes and glamorizes crime but it's such a good movie that i am willing to ignore that. (The second and third portions are preachy sops to the moralists--no, crime does not pay--and i would not rate them higher than two stars, or even one.) A caricature of Wall Street and the free-enterprise system. . .  I don't know Wall Street, of course, but the movie seems to be a caricature of the free-enterprise system, with its endless cynicism about ""Capitalism"". This strikes me like a cold-war propaganda piece, not the real thing. A harrowing, disturbing movie shot with a constantly jitteriy shaking camera.  I understand that, by the nature of t he subject, the experience is disturbing, but why must the quality of the camera work be that of a home movie?

I understand that, by the nature of t he subject, the experience is disturbing, but why must the quality of the camera work be that of a home movie? It's a pleasant romantic comedy, with two very attractive leading characters. The story admittedly becomes quite far-fetched at points (e.g, someone drives off with Gable's suitcase, and the latter CHASES the car on foot, CATCHES UP WITH IT, gets rid of the robber, and keeps the car!) But what the heck the whole is entertaining if you don't think much about anything. Powerful, suspenseful, thought-provoking. . .  The subject is important: a woman's addiction to sex with a younger, handsome, exotic man.  The plot is a bit slow and i am not sure i like the final resolution, but i give the movie extra credit for dealing with an important subject. A fascinating study of a pathological liar.  Was the ""bipolar disorder"" just another lie from this totally corrupt manipulator? Would Madoff get off by claiming that he suffered from this ""disorder""?  The man did get away with a light sentence (actual time spent in prison) for such a criminal.  The movie is rather repetitive once you realize that this executive is forever lying, and the script is therefore rather boring, but the subject is worth the boredom. I guess this is supposed to be a romantic comedy following a suburbanite couple and their endlessly destructive dog Marlee (its destructiveness is supposed to be funny!). But the comedy seems totally cliche-ridden and sentimental, and a waste of time. Give me a good Lassie movie instead anytime. Angelina is a superheroine that the laws of physics cannot stop. She never stops jumping, knocking out men, shooting men, and such endless stunts. But she is as always lovely, so i give the movie 2 stars. immensely inventive and visually extraordinary. . .  I don't care for the anti-Americanism and sophomoric romanticism, but i suppose that the romanticism is part of the charm.  At any rate, the visual effects of the landscapes and skyscapes are astounding, the sound effects great, and the experience enjoyable once you ignore the ""intellectual"" contents. The movie is rather interesting because the subject is. Dillinger was the counterpart of Muhammad Ali: a man who knew how to play the media to romanticize himself as ""the greatest"". But then Dillinger WAS smart, incredibly courageous, and of course a vicious killer in cold blood. The movie seems to be completely authentic. The only thing that nearly made me give the movie just two stars is the sentimental, mawkish 5 minutes (the message to Billie). A great thriller. . . .  The plot is gripping, the photography is great. It's regrettable that 2 of the couples look rather alike, but otherwise the casting is good. The ending is pretty gory, so you are warned. The police are supposed to protect us. Why are they represented as stupid and tragically pompous? E.g, why do they arm themselves with just pistols when they expect to face criminals armed with machine guns and rockets? Why does a detective go alone to confront a mafioso in his den? Shouldn't the public protectors be required to have at least an IQ of 100? A pseudo-deep study/ soap opera of two rather repulsive,sick individuals. . .  The problem with the movie is that the two main characters, as rendered, are immature self-dramatizing individuals that are forever drinking, smoking, talking dirty, and talking about themselves. When did either of them have time to write? This is a serious ambitious movie about relationships--husbands and wives, parents and children, peers-- and it deserves credit for the attempt. It also has pathos and wit. Its themes is seemingly unconditional forgiveness and tolerance but that seems at times unreal and sentimental. The extended deathbed scenes also get too close to schmalz at times. There is also the irrelevant Sierra club type of stupid decision NOT to develop a choice piece of real estate. This girl comedy is just ok. It's not more than that because the central character is brainless and brings her problems on herself. Some scenes are amusing, but for the most part it's all ho-hum. routine disaster movie, another in a long, long series.  By the nature of the disaster, don't expect special visual effects (as when the disaster is a fire, flood, tsunami, volcano, earthquake). So all you see if sick people and people who are try to avoid them. What does a semi-senile feeble woman have to do with the greatest PM of GB in the 2oth century?  Other reviewers suggested that the producers of the movie opposed MT's conservatism and therefore reduced her semi-senile feeble woman, slurring through the principles that helped her revive Great Britain. Whatever the reason, I was deeply disappointed, bored, disgusted, and offended. Interesting but much of it is shot out of focus. . .  The main characters are attractive, there is much suspense, some settings are quite exotic (Alaska. . . ), and the story is clever.  What weakens the story (costing is one star) is the fact that much of it is shot out of focus, presumably in an attempt to make it more dramatic. Suspenseful enough, but rather too long. . .  (Was it really sensible to endanger the Canadian personnel and a CIA operative to extract six US nationals while leaving over 40 hostages behind? The solution to such cases must be political and economic, not military or covert.) On the whole, OK. . .  On the negative side, this movie departs from the book, for no good reason (e.g, Nicky is in therapy). Also the wild parties of Gatsby are done grotesquely.  Still, some of the appeal of the original stays. Just some. I hope and pray that US presidential politics are not as depicted in the movie. Palin was a totally unqualified running mate, abysmally ignorant and irrational, and (according to some scenes) mentally unstable. Is this the best that the US can produce as VP candidate? Do we have to have a woman running mate no matter how unstable and stupid? Interesting but much of it is shot out of focus. . .  The main characters are attractive, there is much suspense, some settings are quite exotic (Alaska. . . ), and the story is clever.  What weakens the story (costing is one star) is the fact that much of it is shot out of focus, presumably in an attempt to make it more dramatic. An extremely clever, suspenseful movie but gratuitously fragmented. . .  There is never a dull moment, there is incredible action, there is extraordinary dialog and there are lots of characters.  Unfortunately the movie, for no apparent reason, jumps back and forth in time. Re-organize the movie to be in chronological order and i will give you the very high rating you deserve. This contains a spoiler.  An excellent if harrowing (and occasionally slow) treatment of the disease called alcoholism.  I was very moved when the pilot finally decided that he couldn't tell any more lies if he was to ever be free. Un acceptable camera work in BOURNE LEGACY. . .  The story may be ok but all i know is that the camera work is so spastic that i get a headache after ten minutes of watching. That's because the camera is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
constantly shaken, swung, swayed, zoomed in and out, blurred, and so on.  I find this intolerable. People talk, talk, talk--about themselves. . .  I must be missing something because i find the movie torturingly boring. It seems that nobody has anything to do other than talk about his/her feelings--e.g, declare that beautiful settings distress her. I also find bizarre that men and women who are NOT romantically involved (just friends) keep forever fondling each other like intimate lovers. Authentic-looking," convincing portrait of a fanatic revolutionary.  Do not expect a balanced view of what the """"power to the proletariat"""" movement did to Russia under Lenin and Stalin and their successors. This is an uncritical"," completely sympathetic documentary and should be taken with a grain (or a bucket) of salt. A disturbing story of a man who gives up what's rightfully his.  A common theme of the 19th century was the nobility of """"Christian"""" self-sacrifice. In the present case", the beneficiary of the self-sacrifice is a woman totally unworthy of the sacrifice. I can't say that this interpretation of morality makes sense to me. a memorable, astounding, disturbing movie . . .  It's a kind of French counterpart of DELIVERANCE except that it COUP is much more philosophical and existential. A mistreated humble man, the butt of everyone's misuse, goes off the deep end and starts avenging himself like a mass (or rather serial) killer.  Excellent acting, including a memorable performance by Huppert. This is an enjoyable love-triangle comedy, where the men start by rivaling each other over the woman but then discover that they are incomplete without each other and the woman. Excellent casting and acting. Seeing Huppert (in a minor role) is an extra bonus. I am sick and tired of the totally predictable corporate bashing that makes this totally predictable movie. There is an idealistic, decent class-action attorney," and there is the evil octopus that is the motor company. Guess who is the hero! Exceptionally fascinating. . .  My understanding is that this is a dramatization of the historical conference in which Himmler got the enthusiastic approbation (except for two more reserved reaction to the genocide.  The casting is superlative and the movie is a must-see for thoughtful students of life and human nature.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ASGIVOW34XNQS," One of the most memorable scenes for me was when Harrison Ford hid behind one seat but turned the neighboring seat to make it look like he was crouched there instead. So when he jumped out and attacked the hijacker I got a nice jolt. This masculine thriller has good pacing and acting but there were a few amateurish special effects that detracted from its realism. I enjoyed this lots more than Ninja Scroll/Akira/Ghost In The Shell. Unlike other anime ... ""Demon City Shinjuku"" doesnt have tons of annoying minor characters or weird subplots. Plenty of violence and humor along with romance. Definitely well worth your time I was glued to the screen during Denzel's intensifying conflicts with his captain. As a new age female ... I'm not a big fan of macho movies but this was way more entertaining than 90% of chick flicks. The pacing/dialogue/character development were all excellent. Wish I'd seen it years earlier instead of dismissing it as a ""dumb guy movie."" Months before running across this movie ... I'd read about Cassavetes and dismissed him as a ""guy's director"" whose movies probably wouldn't interest me. Well I was wrong in a good way. TKOACB is an unusual film that's part crime thriller and part arthouse fare. It's much darker and more depressing than ""The Crying Game"" and asks the fundamental question ""Is art more important than money?"" This film is not easily forgotten. I was disappointed in this romcom. First of all it wasn't very funny. There were some witty one liners but that's it. Plot twist at the end didn't ring true. Thailand part of movie felt forced. You're better off watching ""Made Of Honor"" or ""My Best Friend's Wedding."" Disclaimer: I watch Japanese films and TV drama 99% of the time so am not up to date with American films ""Session 9"" has everything you could ask for ... a real insane asylum that's 100X scarier than any Hollywood set/top notch acting/moody atmosphere/chilling soundtrack/good pace (though it drags in a few places). There are no scantily clad teen girls running around. Instead we get an all male cast ... most of whom are living on the knife's edge emotionally. Performances are taut and realistic. Only major complaint = ending was a bit too contrived. I was scared of the dark after watching this last night! The acting/scenery/special effects were all wonderful. From the very beginning ... you are drawn into the darkness and paranoia of Klein's unraveling life. Is the Mothman real or not? Klein's investigation forces him to confront metaphysics/angels/premonitions and other things that crouch in the shadows. But I didn't care for the ending ... too staged. I wasn't expecting much from this movie. I'd never heard of it but rented it cuz I liked Marisa Tomei in Happy Accidents. It was charming/funny/cheesy and made my weekend. Marisa and RDJ have good chemistry and the plot was intricate enough to keep me guessing. I wish they made more feel good movies like this. I grew up watching ""Star Blazers"" so wanted to check this out. Unfortunately it's nothing to write home about. Disappointed with the casting of Derek (Kodai) and Nova (Yuki). The pacing is too slow and the acting mediocre. Deslock's character was glossed over. Japanese excel at animation and horror but Nipponese live-action drama leaves much to be desired. I'm in the minority here -- skip this unless you have lots of free time. I was expecting a lot from this movie. The trailers made it seem much more exciting and scarier than it actually was. The acting was meh and I lost interest about half way through. The hospital itself was creepy though and I would watch again for the architectural details. It's still 4 stars instead of 3 because it's much better than dreck like ""Dont Be Afraid Of The Dark."" BTW ... the case it came in was broken!!! After studying Japanese for a yr I decided to watch this to see how much I could understand and also because I wanted to see how it compares to the American remake. The dialogue is fairly slow and predictable and a fun way to train one's ear for ""real life"" Nihongo. Not scary enough though and the mother-daughter relationship wasn't convincing. American version has better acting/atmosphere/scares.  UPDATE: Watched this again and liked it better the second time around I adored the beginning of this. Two young French girls (Anna and Francoise) are driving through the countryside and decide to spend the night in an abandoned cottage. Music/location/dialogue and cinematography are excellent. Then Anna disappears. The film loses its magic soon afterwards and I ended up fast forwarding a lot due to boredom. But still ... watch the beginning. I've never seen anything like it. A treat for the eyes and ears :) Order pizza/invite your most sarcastic wise cracking friends over/laugh your arses off. This movie was very very bad. Wooden acting with plot holes a mile wide and a ridiculous deranged ""monster"" who is neither scary nor believable. There's juvenile gratuitous nudity and lots of blood. Awful but still recommended for a good chuckle. Saw this at Blockbuster and almost passed it up. Boy am I glad I didnt. The main character's performance is so authentic. His confusion and pain (as life spirals out of control) is palpable/dizzying/breathtaking. His friendship with the little girl was tender without any trace of Hollywood sap. I was glued to my sofa during the whole film. Hats off to the actors and director. The best part about this movie was when it finally ended. This isn't one of those ""good"" bad movies where at least you can laugh at the cheesiness of it all. Please do your eyes a favor and skip this lemon. I don't understand all the negative reviews. I thoroughly enjoyed this little known gem as it had good dialogue/solid characters/plenty of suspense. The DVD cover makes it look like a grisly horror movie though. This is a well-directed movie that will keep you entertained The acting is above-average for Jhorror. The child stars are cute but not annoying while the adults are portrayed realistically. It was thrilling enough to keep me glued to the screen for 1.5 hrs but not impressive enough to watch twice. UPDATE: The sequel is a far superior (deeper) film. I'm not a big Sandra Bullock fan but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this thriller. The acting is above-average and there are a couple of hair-raising scenes. I didn't like the plot twist involving the husband's affair but other than that this movie is worth a weekday night in. It's actually scarier than horror movies I've recently seen (""Dont Be Afraid Of The Dark"" and ""Friday 13th"" remake) The first episode was the strongest both artistically and plotwise. I lost interest in the middle episodes but then it got really intense when Batman encountered a monster inside Gotham's ancient tunnels. Very dark and atmospheric and far more enjoyable than ""Appleseed Ex Machina."" Well worth a viewing //even// if you think you've no interest in super heroes. BGK isn't just for kids.

Very dark and atmospheric and far more enjoyable than ""Appleseed Ex Machina."" Well worth a viewing //even// if you think you've no interest in super heroes. BGK isn't just for kids. This was a huge disappointment. The beginning was promising ... the FBI works with a psychic to locate a missing agent. However it's all downhill from there as the plot becomes more convoluted. None of the special effects could make up for lukewarm acting and a story that didn't quite gel. Far inferior to the first XFILES movie. I wasn't expecting much from this cuz of the boring cover but thank goodness cover doesnt do justice to the series. This is a much more realistic high school love story than ""Say I Love You."" The characters are memorable and dialogue's funny but animation quality's nothing to write home about. Suzuka's personality grated on my nerves but still definitely worth your time. I'd never heard of this but checked it out cuz it was filmed in Rochester NY (an often overlooked city) and it has one of my fave actresses ... Ms. Dushku. The film is well paced and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. Dushku was perfect for the role ... moody and obsessed. With the recent arrest of the kidnapper I hope more people will watch this gripping thriller I saw short YouTube clips from this series and knew it was a quality show. I've watched all 6 episodes and can't recommend it enough. The acting and direction are above average and the pacing will keep you on the edge of your seat. It includes interviews from passengers and victim's families and truly personalizes these horrific accidents. I adore romcoms and chick flicks like ""Made Of Honor"" and ""My Best Friend's Wedding."" So I had big hopes for ""Bride Wars"" since I like Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway. The story concept is strong but overall execution fell short of my expectations. Some witty dialogue but you're better off watching something with more substance/humor/authenticity. The cover makes this look like a horror movie but it's actually a romantic thriller. Not a bad way to spend a rainy evening. Decent acting/dialogue/suspense/cinematography/theme but minus 1 star for superfluous sex scenes. I'm shocked this romantic movie is receiving such high ratings. Hero is weak and so obviously not a match for spirited and pretty Zooey Deschanel. Yes ... this movie isn't your cookie-cutter romcom. It's far worse!!! At least silly movies like ""The Ugly Truth"" or ""Miss Congeniality"" are funny and uplifting albeit shallow. Watching ""500 Days"" is as fun as having a root canal. Inane dialogue and meandering plot will tempt you to fast forward. This was pretty good and held my attn for a full hr. However I had to stop watching as horror movies are bad for my health. Lead actor (Matt) is sincere and believable while his younger brother and cousin add much needed comic relief. The mom character is likeable too. But unnecessarily grotesque imagery detracts from story. Definitely better than ""Possession"" but not as scary as ""Insidious."" I don't know why this movie only received an average of 3 stars on Amazon. It's definitely in the top 10% of horror movies I've ever seen. The acting is above average and the only reason it's not 5 stars is lack of accuracy ... Nome AK is not lushly forested as depicted. Too intense for viewing alone!!! I'm a 30 something female who has little interest in comics but had a chance to watch this for free. The story didn't pick up until third episode. Art is at a very high level but minus 1 because it was somewhat depressing and far too violent (two decapitations). Overall this is //not// a feel good kid's animation like ""Batman The Animated Series."" I've never played the RE video games but watched this out of simple curiosity. The first 8 minutes was completely riveting and stylish. But after Alice left Tokyo the plot and cinematography bored me to death. I just kept waiting for something to really happen but was sorely disappointed. The ending = let down. ""Resident Evil Afterlife"" stinks!!! As a horror fan and life-long practicing Catholic with an aunt (nun)/great uncle (priest)/half uncle (priest) ... I was eager to see ""The Rite."" It didn't disappoint. Very happy with the stylish lighting/acting/dialogue. Tight plot with almost no boring scenes. The lead priest Michael Kovak held his own against Anthony Hopkins. Original and poetic treatment of a difficult subject. I like this better than ""Exorcism Of Emily Rose"" and ""The Haunting In CT."" Wish I'd seen ""Rite"" in theaters This wasn't an easy video to watch because the subject matter ... a brutal beating and loss of self ... was heart wrenching. Mark Hogancamp is an artist in the truest sense. He creates out of a deep need to make sense of his life and isn't swayed by commercial interests. The WWII town of Marwencol and its brave and brooding dolls cast a strange spell on me. Recommended this to all my artsy friends. The first 30 min were super exciting and fun. It really went downhill the last 30 min (after villain(s) were revealed). Ending was too violent and ""bitchy."" What I like about the Scream franchise is that it's not too sadistic or creepy like many horror movies and won't give you nightmares. ""Insidious"" was so scary I could only watch 30 min of it during the daytime before suffering from extreme fright!!! So my review isn't complete. It's true spine-tingling psychological terror and doesnt depend on gore or violence. The characters are down-to-earth and the plot and dialogue are believable. Minus 1 star for two cheesy amateurish effects. I also watched first 30 min of ""Possession."" And ""Insidious"" is without a doubt far superior. I tried to like this family comedy-drama but couldn't stomach it after Mr Mee bought the zoo. It all went downhill from then on mainly due to poor pacing and the too cutesy performance of Rosie Mee. Matt Damon did a good job as the harried widower but it wasn't enough to make this a ""must see"" family drama. Even if you have nothing else to do ... pass on this. Dont believe the other reviewers!!! I couldn't stand Hayden P in LIFETIME'S ""Amanda Knox"" but it was still a very entertaining way to end my weekend. This was far more interesting than my other Sunday movie ... Daniel Radcliffe in ""Woman In Black."" Definitely held my short attention span and didn't want it to end. Acting was realistic with never a dull moment. Check this out even if you're not a fan of courtroom drama. This is a review for ""White Ghost"" only. The thing that bothered me was the grandmother holding the basketball. While I can see how this element fit into the plot ... it was a distraction more than anything else. Extremely graphic in some parts. I'll definitely never watch this again as ""Ju-On The Curse"" has better plot with less gore I didn't expect much from this movie but it had Jeremy Irons so I had to check it out. Well I was pleasantly surprised to say the least and very impressed with the sharp dialogue and subtle acting. The actors all played their parts deftly and the way things unfolded was realistic and scary. Even if you have no finance background ""Margin Call"" = must see. I just didn't ""buy"" this story ... the goblins weren't scary and the haunted mansion felt more like a set than an actual house. There was a creepy bathtub scene but it didn't make up for the rest of this boring movie. The child actor was adorable but DBAOTD just didn't do it for me. Pass!!! Intense action and sophisticated animation but I just didn't like any of the characters. Last episode was disappointing. Still well worth my time since I watched to improve Japanese ... not because Im an XMEN fan. Im a 40 yr old female with little interest in Tony Stark but I enjoy JP language so this DVD was a real treasure. The action was well-paced and far more thrilling than the films I'd recently seen in theaters (""Insidious III"" and ""Ex Machina""). ""Iron Man"" is more interesting than Marvel's XMEN 2 disc set. Minus half star for a few boring episodes and cliched Japanese-style ending Low ratings are completely unjustified. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this even though it wasn't very scary. Funny dialogue between Alex and her friend Ben/good pacing/mild chills made this a winner. Characters were much more likable than peeps in ""Ouija"" or ""The Conjuring."" Perfect for preteen slumber party I was sooo scared at 30 minute mark ... had to turn off DVD player and watch again the next day. After ghost hunters showed up ... it lost some punch as too many people in the house made it more secure and less frightening. As film progressed it became less suspenseful as TMI was given to audience. Do not watch alone  UPDATE: This is sooo much scarier than sequel I was expecting lots from ""Sinister"" given the positive ratings but it failed to deliver goosebumps. A few atmospheric scenes but not enough chills for 4 stars. Some good acting but I wasn't afraid of the dark after watching this ... sure sign of failure Im not a Keri Russell fan so passed this up the first time I came across it. Big mistake as it's chock full of terrific acting and suspense. Only one annoying scene in the entire film. Director did a good job combining UFO and horror genres though it's not as scary as ""Fourth Kind"" The atmosphere/acting/dialogue in ""Underground"" were above average but the film's a downer. I enjoyed the unique Australian vibe and retro interiors but you're better off watching something that'll pump you up like ""Olympus Has Fallen"" or at least something beautiful like ""The Last Wave."" I watched the first 5 episodes in one sitting. But after that ... the plot twists got repetitive and depressing. Yamato was too clueless at times and Mei should've stood up for herself more. She spent a lot of time pining for him instead of studying etc. The animation quality's good and theme songs are catchy. I enjoyed this more than ""Salaryman Kintaro"" and ""Transformers."" Great for learning JP too!!! This could've been so much more but slow pace and cookie cutter characters irritated me. Only believable character was Lane's boyfriend. Some genuinely atmospheric scenes saved it from being 2 stars I wasn't expecting much from ""The Boy"" but was pleasantly surprised by the witty dialogue and tight script. Way more enjoyable than Annabelle/Babadook/Lights Out. Lead characters are likable and realistic ... not stereotypes. Twist ending was a nice surprise What I like best about ""Hypnotist"" is its honesty. It's not slick like ""Ringu"" or ""Dark Water"" so it feels more realistic to me. Despite some awkward transitions and a dated feel ... it delivers the goods. The first 30 min = OK but the rest of movie was super in terms of pacing/plot/thrills. ""Hypnotist"" is more interesting than Ochiai's ""Kansen."" Definitely worth your time and $$$ (and a good way for intermediate JP students to practice listening). The //idea// behind this movie is wonderful but the execution leaves much to be desired. There wasn't enough character development to make the romance believable. The android sees Eric and boom falls in love and is ready to sacrifice everything for him. That being said  there are some nice songs and action sequences. Got mine for only $10 at Tower Records so Im not too bitter :) I've watched this twice now ... a couple of years apart and it was thoroughly enjoyable both times. The reverse chronological order gives this spooky film an extra twist. Very atmospheric though not terribly original. The soundtrack was distracting at times but still a definite must for Jhorror fans I enjoyed watching ""The Locker"" (aka Shibuya Kaidan) more than ""Slit Mouthed Woman"" because it was more realistic. Story line is simple yet effective. Six college students are terrorized by the ghost of an abandoned baby. This doesnt rely on special effects or gore ... just old fashioned suspense. Not 5 star because of too many ""talking heads"" scenes. Haven't seen ""Locker II"" so cant comment. Just watched again for third time (2016) and still liked it I really enjoyed the first and third stories but the middle one was weak. Cheesy special effects detract from strong plots and pacing. First story about a haunted doll is standard fare but there were truly creepy scenes ... with viscious biting!!! Third story was the most fully realized and kept me on the edge of my seat. Not too shabby. Will keep in permanent collection. I watched part of this yesterday (daytime) and got some fun chills. The acting can be a bit stiff but overall Im really happy with the quality of the plots. Good way to review Japanese too :) I'm a Japanophile but wasn't expecting too much from this as most JP films are too weird or nihilistic. Well this was //very strange// but the beautiful lighting and subdued acting kept me interested. Film fell apart after the main character was imprisoned so that's why it lost 1 star. A unique and eerie movie that's not for everyone This isn't one of those slick shiny teen movies like ""The Locker."" It's grittier with a lower budget and plenty of funny sex scenes and blood. Not scary at all but still worth watching because it takes place in a beautiful remote villa not a cramped apt. Can't get the villa out of my mind and want to visit it ASAP!!! Easy-to-follow dialogue and elegant visuals. The desolate Japan Sea Coast scenery alone was worth the price!!! Unlike most Jdrama ... this kept me on the edge of my seat. Even though the ending was rushed I still enjoyed the story. It didn't bother me that ""Hebi No Onna"" is considered second-rate. Definitely earned a place in my permanent collection. Even though I'm a serious Jhorror fan I'd never heard of ""APT 1303."" Watched it to review JP listening comprehension and was quite impressed. The acting is above average and the plot (albeit unoriginal) moves along at a good clip. This is far more enjoyable/realistic/creepier than ""The Locker"" or ""One Missed Call I."" The last 15 min are overblown and seem out of place but you still don't want to miss this little gem :) I watched this on TV years ago and decided it was worth seeing again. Well ... I liked it (first episode) even better this time around! The actors were likable and plot kept me on the edge of my seat. I had more fun watching this than 95% of the Netflix movies I've seen. Subtracted 1 star because the second episode (Demon Child) was poorly acted and not scary. Horror and thriller fans should definitely check this out!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AU25GMX57XBVO," I am not a big fan of Harrison Ford's work but there have been a few films that I have enjoyed with him in it.  Air Force One is very entertaining with a lot of action and suspense.  The special effects are quite good as well with a lot of different and neat tricks to them.  Overall, if you enjoy action/suspense type movies be sure to give it a view.  Peter J. Miller This has got to be the most chilling, suspenseful movie I have ever seen.  It will have you on the edge of your seat from the beginning till the end and then some.  Not a large budget film or a horror movie but has the same type of feel to it.  If you like very suspenseful movie's then check it out and you will not be disappointed.  Peter J. Miller Arguably still Steven Seagal's best film to date.  From the beginning to the end you are hooked on the movie with all the ingredients that make a good action film or Seagal film.  Would be nice to have some extra features on movie but none are included as of yet, being they could re-release it with some extras I would think is possible.  A must have for all Seagal fans.  Peter J. Miller This movie started out kind of slow then all at once it seemed to get very suspenseful and interesting in a very weird/evil kind of way.  The plot kept my attention but was also a little strange for some reason, especially how it started and ended.  Nonetheless, if you like suspenseful political thrillers then think you could enjoy it.  Peter J. Miller One of Nicholson's best movies yet to date I think.  It can truly touch you personally like many of his movies can.  Once Jack Nicholson's legacy is complete, this movie should be around the top of his career, but since so many of his movies are great, it's hard to say exactly how far to top it will be.  A must for all Nicholson fans.  Peter J. Miller This is for sure the best movie I have seen Mel Gibson in so far.  I did enjoy the Legal Weapon films somewhat yet Ransom is more entertaining I thought.  It kept my attention well from beginning to end and never got bored watching it.  Not sure why it is not available on blu-ray format since it should be.  A very well rounded movie that you would probably enjoy watching more than once.  Peter J. Miller Terminator 3 is no Terminator 2, but not too bad of a follow-up.  It would be hard to top T2 in terms of action and suspense but T3 does bring some pretty good material to the franchise.  Better than T. Salvation I thought, since it is hard to imagine a terminator movie without Schwarzenegger.  I would rate it my second favorite Terminator movie behind T2, with T1 of 1984 3rd and terminator salvation 4th.  Peter J. Miller This movie is a lot of fun and a pretty decent comedy.  I am not a big adam sandler fan and if jack nicholson was not in it probably would have not rated it very well.  Nicholson brings a lot to the movie and can be a good comedic actor as well since he does not do many comedy's.  Overall a fairly decent family comedy without too many obscene or gross scenes.  Peter J. Miller I found, Out of Time to be ok and not really that interesting.  Seemed like it had potential to be better but got a little confused in the middle of the movie and really did not keep my attention well from the beginning to the end.  Probably only for the die hard D. Washington fan.  Peter J. Miller Would think that usually it's the other way around in real life, that someone looking for work would be stalking a headhunter or boss of a good company to get them hired, yet this movie was just the opposite.  Overall it was not too bad, kept my attention well throughout the movie and was quite suspenseful.  Worth a watch if you enjoy corporate/office suspense films.  Peter J. Miller I did not like today you die very much. The script just did not seem like a good fit for Seagal.  I think some of the scenes were taken from other movies which was a turn off for me as well.  Probably only for the serious Seagal fan, otherwise look towards say ""the keeper' or 'belly of the beast for a better picture.  Peter J. Miller Terminator 3 is no Terminator 2, but not too bad of a follow-up.  It would be hard to top T2 in terms of action and suspense but T3 does bring some pretty good material to the franchise.  Better than T. Salvation I thought, since it is hard to imagine a terminator movie without Schwarzenegger.  I would rate it my second favorite Terminator movie behind T2, with T1 of 1984 3rd and terminator salvation 4th.  Peter J. Miller Driven to Kill is another so so release from Seagal's library of DTV movies.  Better than some and not nearly a good as say The Keeper or Belly of the Beast.  I know it's difficult with so many movies being made these days that coming up with an original script is not easy.  Guess was hoping for some more originality but all in all worth at least one viewing.  Peter J. Miller I didn't find Max Payne very interesting and thought the script was just kind of weird.  The movie really did not make much sense to me and could not get into it.  Don't get me wrong, Mark Walberg is a fine actor but this is not one of his better films.  Peter J. Miller Just really could not get into the movie very much, yet at first the story did seem a little interesting but was kind of bored some throughout the film and was confused at times to what was going on.  Maybe if your a fan of Tommy Lee Jones then you could enjoy it, but would not call this one of his better pictures.  Peter J. Miller The town was a pretty good action movie with a decent story to it.  It's not a family movie or one for kids so be sure of that, but for an action R picture had quite some meaning to it.  I have not seen many movies with Ben Affleck but he did a good job here in making it entertaining.  Hope he continues to do so in the future.  Peter J. Miller Maybe because my vision is a little hazy or I don't see perfect 20/20 yet really could not tell what I was watching.  The title made no sense, I never laughed, could not understand what was going on, and got lost since the title description did not really happen in the film.  If you pass on this movie, don't feel bad since you probably saved yourself 90 minutes you would want back.  Peter J. Miller Already dead was not too bad at all for a not so big budget film.  It is not a horror movie except maybe just at the beginning a little, but for sure R rated.  The story I thought was quite original, interesting and really can't compare it to anything else I have seen recently.  A revenge type film that has many unique turns to it.  Worth a watch for any suspense type movie fan.  Peter J. Miller This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It almost reminded me of a bad soap opera type theme as maybe a few other films I have seen have.  Seemed like I was watching the clock just to see when it was going to end.  If you like drama, soap opera type movies then think you could enjoy it but otherwise if you skip it don't think you will be missing much.  Peter J. Miller This movie was very suspenseful from the start till the end and never got bored watching it.  The ending surprised me as well and had to think about it for a second to put it all together but am sure I have it correct.  If you like suspenseful thrillers then you should enjoy it.  Peter J. Miller",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2VJ80PM1G00QV," Nothing at all profound or even original in this ringside murder mystery but 100 minutes of entertainment. DePalma keeps up the pace while Cage and Company do a good job with fairly stereotyped characters. Subtlety is in very short supply but overblown characters and suspense are the objective here; an objective reached. For a pleasant evening with no burdensome problems of public policy or the human condition to make you think, this will hit the spot. Perhaps, I  was not in the mood;  but this entry in the William James look-a-like contest just did not make it with me. No particular complaints, I simply was not caught up in the whirl of creaks and groans. The cast did well enough with what they had to work with, but they were not able to create the aura of mystery and suspense needed to induce the necessary spell. One more for the fans who can count on no new ones until the Governor leaves office.....if then.  It has what his fans want, plenty of action with the good guys winning, and a decent story of a fireman who seeks revenge for the murder of  his wife and child by Colombian terrorists.  No doubt it will satisfy action fans with other heroes besides ""The Big Guy"". Not at all bad. What else need be said. Speaking only to the mature set: you can watch this one with almost the same pleasure as the younger and older sets. It is a fine family movie, colorful, action-filled, and generally interesting. Not up to the two previous one but still good vireing. Lacking the haloed charisma of Superman or Spiderman, the Fantastic Four still translate well into film making for a purely fun interlude. Really don't know to which age group it is intended to appeal beyond the young but it is not limited to the very young. Without any visible message to convey, it is organized to provide entertainment without being burdened by social significance. It is an appropriate vehicle for family viewing. Anthony Hopkins is outstanding as the Stranger who comes to board in the widow's upstairs rooms. Her young son is played with surprising skill by a youngster whom I have not previously seen. Fine direction lends weight to the the performance of the young girl, the girl-friend, and all parts are filled as one would hope them to be. A movie for everyone in the family, plucking the right cords of sentiment without goo-iness. This is a funny film. It is totally lacking in political significance. No insight into The Human Situation should be looked for. No great Comic characters, like Falstaff or even Sheridan Whiteside,  are to be found. What we do get is some good laughs, some good slapstick action and some funny verbal sallies. Put them together and you have a most enjoyable, forgettable 85 minutes. It suited me to a T. The editorial reviewer got it right. This younger Dalgliesh is tougher and more aggressive in his approach to his job than the older, wiser, more humane Inspector of the later shows. Writers, directors and actors share the credit for first rate television: complex people, good plotting and only the  violence necessary to justify the label of mystery. It is recommended for all to whom this genre appeals. The fact that there is little novelty in the script and an almost 'by the way' conspiracy theory, doesn't alter my pleasure in seeing Morgan Freeman and John Cusack do their stuff along with a competent cast. There are no script highlights that occur to me, no major failings. Its simply like watching a  90 minute episode of your  favorite manhunt television series. I can't take exception to the large number of reviewers who found this one not worth the time to see or even to consider viewing. It is possible that the very young ones will find a virtue in it but otherwise you will find it not even worth the time spent giving it a trial. I can't take exception to the large number of reviewers who found this one not worth the time to see or even to consider viewing. It is possible that the very young ones will find a virtue in it but otherwise you will find it not even worth the time spent giving it a trial. Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins do a fine job in this terrorist conspiracy theory thriller. The rest of the cast supports ably while the director keeps them all incisively moving allowing no lagging moments to break the pattern of suspense. The film makes the most of the paranoid nature of those involved and how uninvolved innocent people can be caught in their web of suspicions. Good viewing. There are no superior films in this collection but plenty of decent movies in the range 2 and 4 stars. For the price, you will have something to watch in those time periods when you are not prepared to come to grips with a major film. I would have given perhaps one four, two or three two's, and the rest three's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3UU1V0MP4I9GL," Good movie with adventure and entertainment. Some humor thrown into the mix and mystery. Me and my dad enjoy watching this movie. The screen write has some interesting aspects as well. A character that I enjoyed before she could talk of had friends of her own. This is a nice spin on the general idea of a strong female and makes learning about friends and general attitude a lot more fun as well. I'm a young woman and I still enjoyed this movie and so did my boyfriend of three years I only watch this movie to see David Tennat and I have to say that overall if had a nice spin on some of the old ideas. It still made for a decent ending. Also David Tennat was hilarious. I watched this on amazon first them my friend ended up having the movie at her house the night after I had already seen it. I enjoyed it so much that I watched it two nights in a row. It has the same great characters and though it can follow a predictable route they still through a few loops in there. For the fathers out there its also shows the diabolic side of you that really wanted to freeze ray the boy that broke your daughters heart first. And many other laughable moments. The minons of course are a great relief through out the movie. I have ha a fondness for Tinkerbell since I was a little girl. Now I'm in my mid 20s and still enjoyed this movie with my boyfriend. You Deff. have to be a fan of Disney to enjoy. had to watch the first one so I could see the second even if you haven't seen the first movie you can still enjoy the second one there are some jokes that reference the first but not a long story line  laughed every time someone made a pun about the leek though  recommend info: female age 26 This was not a disappointment. I enjoyed watching this movie with my boyfriend and father who are talking about the differences and the twist in the plot through the whole things. :-/ Even though the company was over educated and annoying, the movie still pleased them as well. :) My co workers talked about this movie and I wanted to see it just from the previews. I'm not a zombie person at all! I can't stand the walking dead or anything else that has zombies. I close my eyes and hate it. Even the boneys in the movie were okay with me and the visual parts were nicely done. It was a time old tale of course but the spin was nice. Very light hearted and entertaining. This was a cute movie that I enjoyed with my little cousins. They wanted to watch something fun and this worked out great. Enjoyed the different monster and still some adult themes for the audience as well. Didn't really like the first part of the movie but started to enjoy the last half. More comedy and smiles at the end it just took some building up to get there. I don't care how oold I get I will always like Tinker Bell and her friends. There is a nice little twist to this one that helps to put a spin on ""put yourself in there shoes."" It was good for a thriller. There were stupid questions that you would ask yourself while watching the movie. It has a little bit of an underlying adult theme. I didn't like the end however, I think it could have ended with a news playing or recording something along those lines. It was worth watching at least once. It does not seem like a lot of though went into any of the script. Very shallow amount of attention is required. It was more interesting to watch just for the throw back to the old games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A29QTH2Q3G9OOJ," Love air force one. We've one this movie for awhile. But I've been all the sudden watching it. Not cause of harrison ford, but Gary oldman. I think he's cute/attractive. EVeryone did a good job. ""GET OFF MY PLANE."" This is one of my top favorite christian movies. I love jeff fahey and my girl, helen Hannah, and her brother makes it comical as well as carol alt. Nick mancuso plays the anti-christ ans usual. I like the movie, basically, because jimmy smits was in it. He's very nice looking. Plus, the girl did a good job on her part as well as kim basinger. i give it 3-stars. like I said, not a bad thriller-suspense movie. i loved terminator 2. The only problem I had was the language, to much. I just love the story, specially the relationship between the terminator and the boy. It made me cry when he had to say goodbye and then they embrace. I mean look at that. Like, Sarah said, ""If a machine can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too"". 5-stars. The cast is great. Good job, James Cameron. As always, I love raymond. Not every single episode of all nine seasons are great, but, they know real comedy. It's too bad there aren't any real good comedies like this anymore. Live on, raymond! i got this basically cause I like Theogate, It's not easy being green, Home for the weekend, twinkle twinkle little star & Dance mania. But it was still good. My favorite season is season six. Again still a good season. Love cosby show. I loved this film. I was also taken by surprised by how good it was. It really draws your attention. At first the beginning seem boring, but after 15 mins, it gets good. I love the casino owner & was touched by ally,the one who had cancer. I wish they had a sequel to see what would happen to them after this/or if they were in another crisis. Excellent! I loved it. five stars! I loved this film.

Nice movie & of course james earl jones did a good job being the narrator as his voice as darth vader! Oceans was twice as good as earth, cause of course, the water. seeing underwater is always memsmerizing. Seeing the whales was touching, so as seeing the baby turtles, so cute even though those sorry birds were pecking them. and of course i love the dolphins.

A1ELO9LMSE1CQ7," Harrison Ford portrays the President of the US. VERY GOOD movie! I really enjoyed it. It keeps you on the edge of your seat & is very action packed! 5 stars! Best movie of all time! Way better than Avatar! Can't wait for the Blu-ray release! Very good portrayal of the sinking of the titanic. Makes you remember all the lives lost. May they RIP. James Cameron's best work EVER! My favorite movie of all time I used to watch this all the time as a kid! Definitely a good movie dealing with teen issues & supermodel hype. I wish Disney would convert this to DVD! This is a really good movie! I recently watched this movie for the 1st time the other day. I was very impressed. I didn't find it cheesy or stupid. I give it 5 stars. It's nice to see some female superheroes out there. I love the action in this film & She looks amazing! MEOW!! This is one is Disney Best DCOMs. I really liked this one! Definitely brought back memories from my childhood. It's funny, child-friendly and just plain awesome. I mean, a computerized house of the future! Isn't that cool?! 5 stars! I love this movie! This is one of my all-time favorite DCOM's EVER! I wish they still made films like these. This one is hilarious! At times, it's gross with all the Alien slime and stuff. Very funny family movie. Used to watch all the time with my sister as a kid! 5 stars! Bring on the DVD already! This movie follows the book more closely than the 1976 version. I really enjoyed this one! It's remade for a new generation and I agree with that. I love both versions the same. Give this one a try, you will not be disappointed. 5 stars! Angela Bentis does an amazing job! I watched this a lot when I was younger. I grew up in a strong Catholic Portuguese family. I absolutely LOVE this film! It has great motives and meanings for children. The Children of this generation should follow in the footsteps of these little 3 saints. Lucia, Jacinta & Francisco. I'm sure your children will love this film and ask to watch it over an over again! God Bless! The Little Flower blooms with this film. It tells the story of St. Therese. She was a magnificent woman. I watched this in theaters with my mom & now we own it on DVD. It's a very spiritual & captivating movie for the whole family! I'm sure you will all love this film. Please disregard all the negative feedback from others, this truly deserves 5 stars! God Bless! This movie is action packed & thrilling! keeps me on the edge of my seat! Milla does an excellent job as Violet! People need to stop giving bad reviews! This movie has awesome effects & lots of action. Her outfits are cool too! I give this movie 5 stars! One of my favorites! This is an awesome movie! One of my favorite Disney movies! I met Jason Dolley before. He said the suites were very hot and made them sweat a lot. Figures lol This is an awesome movie! One of my favorite Disney movies! I met Jason Dolley before. He said the suites were very hot and made them sweat a lot. Figures lol Pretty good movie. Projects that the 'Illuminati' are a real threat to the Catholic Church. There are secrets everywhere. I enjoyed this movie. Although, there are viewpoints I don't agree on, I still think this movie is good. I loved how it showed the election process for the new pope with the college of cardinals. Very Good movie! DOES NOT deserve best movie of all time! That belongs to Titanic!! This movie has a good plot & Romance setting though. I liked it. Good action! Another good film from Cameron This is an awesome movie! It makes you think and suspect different people at different times. This is a new Era for Wes Craven. Teens will love this movie. If your looking for a great Thriller with a little action, horror & Mystery then this is it! 5 stars! I loved this movie! The remake is amazing! I watched this 2 times in theaters and couldn't wait to buy this on blu-ray! Very suspenseful and at times, will make you jump! Perfect for around Halloween or any time of the year! This movie was OK. It was not what I expected it to be pretty much. It was sketch & a little lame. I still liked it though. It addresses a very real threat in this day and age. The demon is at large and the public needs to be fully aware of this. I give this movie 3 stars. It's worth watching though. This was one of Natalie Portman's BEST films! She truly deserves an Oscar for this role! My friends and I absolutely loved this movie! It was thrilling, sensual, funny & straight up awesome! I give this 5 stars! Good job Natalie!! Steven Speilberg never lets us down! This show is amazing! What a great story line! I mean at a $4 million budget per episode, how can this show not succeed? I'm very excited for the rest of the season. I recommend it to all! Being a HUGE fan of the previous spider-man movies, I was excited to watch this new film. Andrew Garfield does a great job as the new spider-man and I feel audiences will enjoy both the action and humor in the film. Definitely worth watching and can't wait for the sequels! An interesting film about the Medieval church, crusades, and the fight of Witchcraft. This film is both trilling and suspenseful. A good film to watch on a night devoted to scary movies and thrills. This show has all the suspense, drama and adventure that we all learned from our childhood stories. This is my new addiction. I love it & can't wait for season 2! My favorite cartoon from when I was a kid! I've been waiting a LONG TIME for these DVD. Thank GOD!! I'm all for Ickis! He's my favorite!!! I'm glad these are back. Check em out! You'll love these little guys! I've only seen one whole episode and part of another on St. Patrick's Purgatory, but I must say that this is truly remarkable. Fr. Robert Barron does a spectacular job in revealing to us, a journey to the heart of the true Christian faith, which is Catholicism. I can't wait to watch the rest of the series! This will be a program that I will watch over and over again. God Bless! I'm a huge Titanic buff and this series looks like it's going to be amazing! I'm giving this 5 stars because I know Julian Fellows will not disappoint! Downton Abbey was amazing and by the look of the previews, this epic new series looks spectacular! I can't wait! I just finished watching this amazing program. I must say that I am moved by the courage and attitude of Titanic's engineers who went down with her that night. Their sacrifice resulted in the saving of 705 lives! I recommend this program to all! This ""remake"" was ok. I really enjoyed both the 1978 & 2002 versions.  Honestly, I was expecting more in the prom massacre scene, but oh well.  Overall, I enjoyed the film and it was well made. What an amazing film. Every aspect of it is breath taking. The overall theme of not giving up and the nature of what it means to be human (love, helping one another, triumph, trust, etc) is very inspiring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1AL0YTL28G4AB," This movie is so packed with action that you are on the edge of your seat through the whole show. Harrison Ford plays a fantastic role as the president, and is his usual admirable self. Good Movie! This movie was different, but fairly interesting. I love to study  prophecy, so that is what drew my attention. Some of the information was new to me, so I am not sure of the reliability of the content. Road House is another of my favorite Patrick Swayze movies. It is not suitable for children to watch and I wish they had made it without the undesirable content, but it is a good movie. I have used this series in different children's classes and I have always been pleased with the presentation and content. There are two commandments per disk and they are very well done. I would recommend these to anyone working with children. This is one of Patrick Swayze's best movies, although the content is not suitable for children. It would have been just as good if they had left out the undesirable content. Harrison Ford is one of those guys you can watch over and over and never get tired of. I love his movies and Sabrina was no exception. This is one of those movies that just make you feel better. There is something calming about watching good westerns. Maybe it brings back a way of life that we will never experience again. The good guys are always upstanding, honest, hard working and have lots of character and good moral ethics. I find this true with all Tom Selleck movies, including this one. This is another Tom Selleck favorite. He plays such an admirable character in his movies and I like that about a leading actor, whomever they are. There is something about this time period that appeals to me, maybe because life was much simpler then. It is a good movie to watch! This movie was different, but fairly interesting. I love to study  prophecy, so that is what drew my attention. Some of the information was new to me, so I am not sure of the reliability of the content. This series is very intense, but I purchased them all and watched until the very end. Great caste of characters!  They keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time, but you keep watching. I just love watching Tom Selleck. I admire the characters he portrays and he makes a good hero. These DVDS have been a real source of entertainment for me, as are some of the other older series. I have the first and second series and will purchase more eventually. Love them! I really enjoy Tom Selleck movies! Maybe it is because he plays parts that have a lot of character and good moral ethics. I can watch his movies over and over and not get tired of them. This was such a movie. These children's Bible Stories are very well done. The only problem I have with them is they are close to an hour long and my classes are about an hour long, so it leaves little time for discussion, etc. Other than that, I would recommend them to anyone working with children. This is another Tom Selleck movie that I really enjoy watching, over and over. He always plays characters that can be admired. They are upstanding, have character, good moral values and someone you can respect. Qualities that are hard to find in the present time. Very good movie! I love to watch Tom Selleck. After watching all the movies of him I could find, I decided to get the TV Series, Magnum PI. I have not been disappointed. I look forward to watching one of his shows, when I have some time in the evenings. They are just as good now, as they were then. Very entertaining! The Magnum PI Series are enjoyable to watch, I never get tired of them. In the evenings, when you cannot find anything suitable to watch on television, it is great to know you have something to look forward to. They are clean, serious, comical, and very entertaining. Along with a few other choice series, I have all I want to watch. Watching Tom Selleck might have something to do with it, too. I bought this DVD because Patrick Swayze has been one of my favorite actors for a long time, and since his death I wanted to get some of his movies. Red Dawn is an excellent one and with the world situation like it is, I can see something like that happening any time. I would have ended it a little differently, but it was a good movie. It is hard to find something to watch that is wholesome and entertaining, but this TV Series works for me. It is refreshing to go back to a time when things were so simple; yet life was very demanding, too. These people show strength and courage with good moral character. Great for family viewing! Sam Elliot is another favorite of mine. Not only in westerns, but in other action movies as well. This collection is a good one and the Rough Riders is actually a two DVD movie, part one and two. Good Sam Elliot movies! This is a great family movie. These characters never fail to entertain me; they are terrific. I have shared this movie, and the series, with several of my friends and they all just fall in love with them. My pastor and his grand-daughter are watching them now and think they are great, too. I am collecting this series of DVDs. I love Tom Selleck and like watching him portray different characters. This series is about a family of law enforcers with Selleck as the head of the family. It is a family oriented, basically. with some violence. I find them very entertaining.. I bought this movie because I am in the process of reading the books written by Lee Child and I really enjoy them. I wanted to see how Tom Cruise portrayed the character of Jack Reacher, and I think he did a great job. I will buy any that are produced in the future. I put Tom Selleck right up there with John Wayne in my choices of characters to watch. This is a good family oriented series that I find enjoyable.  I am into the crime scene type of movies, so I am entertained; not boring. I am a prophecy enthusiast and I have been looking for the first movie ""The Omega Code"", but could not find it. When I saw this collection, I was thrilled that I could get them all at one time, in a package. Great movies! I just used this DVD with my lesson on the Story of Abraham in our Sunday School class and was a little disappointed in it. It is not the same quality of the ones purchased from Nest and I will try and replace it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AGNEQB0L6NJ1K," I just love the British accent and the Spice Girls were not half bad.  The story line was fast paced and it flowed for a Musical as such.  The Spice Girls will not let you down with their Hip Hop song style that you can't watch without falling in love with them. This movie has always been one of my all time favorites and now I'll be able once again was all the beautiful scenery along with the superb acting.  It a very long story line, but it couldn't be shortened without destroying everything. This a sequel that to me exceed's the original with breathtaking action, mixed with such wonderful scenery.  I've been to Australia, but would love to have been where this was filmed. The DVD was one of two that I needed to complete my Disney Collection and I enjoyed watching all over again.  The animation was even better than I remembered making it even more enjoyable to watch. Laurel and Hardy can bring laughs in a thunderstorm.  The characters they portrayed seem to fall in line with other movies they stared in.  Tis movie will leave you once again laughing to their slap stick form of comedy. This one superb movie that keep's one on the edge.  The action scene's were stunning, and at time's I don't know how they pulled it all off.  This was a beautiful action/love story which to me was very touching. This one superb movie that keep's one on the edge.

This film left me hanging on to my seat with excitement.  Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe did more than a superb acting job, and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. This film left me hanging on to my seat with excitement.  Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe did more than a superb acting job, and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I was thrilled when I found this particular DVD available on Amazon.  It is one of many DVD's that I can add to my ever growing Christian Theme Educational Library.  This Author has it all together and brings nothing but the ""Whole Truth"". As I watch this timeless trio of Artistic Cinema it never seems that F. L. Coppola is able to come up with such riveting drama, and action thrilled non-stop story line.  It is never dull watching such perfection in Cinema. I will at last be able to see these time honoring Disney animation.  I loved some of characters from the Jungle Book, and Disney does it again with this new funny, loving imaginative characters. This is a very interesting remake of an old classic.  Action, lights, camera for this must have been a fun film to make.  I can only imagine what thrills were all shared in the making of this movie. This is a very interesting remake of an old classic.  Action, lights, camera for this must have been a fun film to make.  I can only imagine what thrills were all shared in the making of this movie. This was my first time watching this collection, and I give it nothing but the Highest of Praise.  This would be the perfect gift to give any child to help them understand events that pertained to our country without getting too political. I now can watch the Five Greatest Football games of all time.  I was unable to see the 1st four and now the waiting is all over.  Go Steeler win another for the Steeler Nation. I am amazed that I was able to obtain this fact filled DVD about the Lord Jesus Christ.  It will be more than a experience literally devouring the contents of what well known author Lee Strobel has included in this Trilogy. This venture between two great animators just did not impress me it was just too far out there for me to recommend it for viewing by only by selective adults, and not It is hard to make a sequel, but even harder the 3rd time around.  The characters of the previous movies held their own , and made this movie as exciting  as Open Season 1 and 2.  This is an action packed movie that can be enjoyed by both young and old. No matter how many times I view this movie it seems like the 1st time all over again.  I am a sucker for good true stories, especially human inter action with animals (Horses mostly).  The acting was superb and it brings back memories of a Mare colt being born on our little farm in Pennsylvania.  If you have never seen this outstanding movie, because you'll love it to no end. I am currently watching the second of the DVD's in this series and am thrilled to having obtained it for such a fantastic price.  These DVD's are a fantastic series that will very certainly enrich my ever expanding knowledge of God's amazing creations. I was amazed when I 1st saw Argo initially and couldn't possibly understand what the captive Americans went through.  For those who don't believe  these things could not happen, but they did.  I am proud to be born in America, and especially that our Country then cared for it's Citizen's to do what was necessary for their release.  Everyone that calls themselves an American needs to understand what could happen to them when outside the confines of our boarders. I can only say that I laughed, cried, and all those emotions that most men aren't supposed to have when watching a beautifully made movie.  I can watch it over and over again and find something new and wonderful.  Please if you want to see one of the most exciting fun filled movie with a cast of not the elite of Hollywood rush out and buy this movie. This one superb movie that keep's one on the edge.  The action scene's were stunning, and at time's I don't know how they pulled it all off.  This was a beautiful action/love story which to me was very touching. This is a stunningly made which is not only action packed, but filled with many tear jerking moment's that can tug at one's heart.  It is long, but worth it all. I can truly say that these two movies have combined the best in Animation, special effects, story line and just plain excitement to come along in some time.  I have watched them more than once for the excitement they generate is catching and just plain takes me to a my Happy Place.  Do rush out to buy this movie duo for you'll not be sorry. I can once again watch both of the movies that do fit one after another, unlike other sequels.  I am thrilled with the comedy, and seemingly non-stop action.  If you haven't seen this duo rush out and buy it. I haven't seen this movie as of today, but all the reviews make it a must see tear jerking love story.  This is based on the real true Philomena Lee, and I am just a sucker for a true to life story as compared to the fantasy world that most of Hollywood portrays. I look forward to seeing this installment of Disney Animation.  If it is at all like their other efforts I am sure I will be not only entertained, but be amazed as well. I loved this on the big screen, but now I can Sing, dance, or whatever, and not feel like every eyes are upon me.  The music was superb and the whole story line was outstanding. The cast of Toy Story are once again united in this gut wrenching "" P I X A R "" film.  I am sure that you'll enjoy watching it over, and over again. This was one of the funniest Animated movies I've seen in a long time.  I missed seeing it on the big screen, but I laughed and laughed more than ever along the MINIONS adventures.  Their story seems to mirror some of the struggles we all go through on a day to day basis.  If anyone hasn't seen this movie yet, believe you me Disney has to take a back seat to thus one.  Go Minions GO! I am excited to have this very truthful DVD exploring the truly Incredible Creatures that share this planet with mankind.  This the 2nd in the series of three, and it is going to be more than an excellent way to learn about God's creation. I am more than excited to view this very informative side of our reason for being here.  I have always disagreed with the theory of Evolution, but now I'll have a Christian World View to back my beliefs. i had long heard about this Blu-ray being in the negative light but, I found just the opposite.  I found that the story line seems to follow a very exciting Love connection,  This shows the commitment between everyday people and, the love's of their life. I have had a pre-view of this DVD and just say nothing but Good about it.  For all you people on the edge between Creationism versus Darwinism this should set you on the right path.  Natural selection has been taught for years without any seemingly no opposition until several honest people took a fresh look at the flaws in Darwins theory. This is certainly an amazing story, and one I hope that other's will agree.  The situation's that take place seem far fetched, but the ""prof is in the pudding"".  This is a film that would be one that people of all ages will appreciate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He bases his plea on the Beatles song ""All you need is Love"".  Caution, a real tear jerker.  Recommended for a mature audience.   Gunner  April, 2008 Blade  DVD  Blade starring Wesley Snipes is the one that started it all.  Snipes is the protagonist who seeks out and destroys vampires.

Highly recommended for action/adventure fans and for fans of Wesley Snipes.  Gunner  December, 2007 The Bourne Identity  I believe that this was one of Robert Ludlum's first novels.

A2UX5ABICURKL5," I like this version alot better than what they showed in the movie theatre, It told the story better. As far as the American version this one was better. I rate this DVD a 4 of 5 stars!! A very sad movie of how a man wastes all his life selling drugs & spending time in jail. I would recommend this movie. I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!! This is my favorite Paul Newman Movie. The most eggs I've ever seen someone eat in one hour. This is a timeless classic, I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!! After part 3 flopped so badly they had to bring Michael Back. This movie should have been part 3. This is a movie about a serial killer that usually strikes on Halloween, not some stupid halloween mask making you spit out insects and snakes. I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!! I love this movie, I love movies about small town life. I'm a country boy at heart, even if I live in the DFW Metroplex. I'm also a fan of George Strait, I've listen to him since I was a teenager. Country & rock music is in the bloodline. I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!! The movie was ok, they could have gotten a lot better director to make the movie. Considering the person who wrote this book, wrote ""The Godfather"". I give this movie 3 of 5 for Trying!! ICE-T starts out as a homeless man down on his luck, trying to get back on his feet, and in the process of it all he is aproched by a man about doing a job for him which would help him get back on his feet again... I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!! This is a very good action/comedy Julia & Nick are a great pair. This move is about 2 reporters always trying to scoop the other one on the headline story and end up falling in love with each other. I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!! Dennis Quaid plays the cheating husband that is living in denial. Julia Roberts is the loving wife that does nothing wrong. Julia Robert finds out that Dennis is having a affair with another women. So she and her daughter go to Mommy's & Daddy's house. They have their time of bickering back in forth, They finally get back together after figuring out divorce isn't worth the pain. I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!! When this movie first came out it was big mainly with Italian people. By the end of the series this movie had captured the hearts of all Americans. This is the best boxing movie series ever made, this is the movie that made Sylvester Stallone the superstar he is today. Rocky will always be an American hero!! I rate this DVD series a 5 of 5 stars!! I thought this movie had a good story line, But ever since JAWS I wait for the person to go under water then come back up being dragged around by the shark. I guess I've watched JAWS to much. LOL The best movie/documentary I've seen since JAWS is BLUE WATER/WHITE DEATH. These movies aren't for the weak hearted. I thought it could have had better attack scenes from the sharks. I rate this DVD a 4 of 5 stars!! Very good movie, a great Family movie. Michael Keaton plays the coolest dad of the season!! Just a all around fun movie!! I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!! Basicly a remake of a classic about adults that don't want to grow up. This movie is cool, I suggest you watch it at least once!! I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!! This movie was good, just not as good as Part 1&2. This series was at it's best back when Clive Barker was making the movies. It seems that every movie you see less & less of Pinhead. I would say it has a good storyline, but not as good as Clive Barker's original creation in Part 1 & 2!! I rate this DVD a 4 of 5 stars!! I bought this movie not knowing anything about it. To my surprise I found it to be very fun, a good comedy. No it's not a big blockbuster, but it's Rodney doin what he does best. I would say this movie is worth it to buy!! I would rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!! Back when they made something worth watching, these days there's so much trash on TV you could fill a landfill with it. Writers at that time knew how to write stories, not this crap on TV today!! This show is very family friendly, great for the whole family. I give it 5 of 5 Star...It's to bad they don't make shows this well anymore... The trash that is on TV today doesn't come close to these TV series. The waltons & little house on the prairie, Two of the best TV series in the history of TV!! Don't forget ""Highway to Heaven"" another good one. I give this DVD set a 5 of 5 stars!! <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Waltons-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0001DMXEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Waltons - The Complete First Season</a> I remember watching this when I was a kid, one of my favorite shows. I always wanted to do those tricks they did in the General Lee. A must have for all fans of The Dukes of Hazzard!! This was a good comedy that shows white & black people aren't that different!! I love Bernie Mac, he play a great father & drives a go-cart pretty good. I rate this DVD a 4 of 5 stars!! Michael, Jason, Freddy & Leatherface the original in Slasher horror movies. I think Hollywood should make a movie called ""WINNER KILLS ALL"" have all 4 characters in the movie. Lets see who the best of the best is, the battle of the Titans!! I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!! This movie is about 2 old men fighting over a women, Typical men...Not!! These men have known each other since they were little kids...they are kinda jealous of each other after all these years. I'd say it's a funny romantic comedy. I rate these movies a 5 of 5 stars!! This version is a little Darker than the American remake. Also be ready to read Sub-titles, in the tradition of J-Horror flicks this one lives up JU-ON & Ringu!! I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!! It was a great TV series...Sorry to say there ain't any like it anymore. NBC-ABC-CBS only put out trash anymore I don't watch those channels anymore. I miss the TV shows from the 80's and early 90's and Hollywood is no exception, They put out more trash than you put in a landfill. Lookin back this series I rate this dvd a 5 of 5 stars!! I thought it was a great return for MR. HODDER, even though you still don't see his face much. I would say it's one of the more original horror flicks I seen in a while. This will be the 21st Century Friday the 13th. I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!! (((((Don't Listen to movie Critics))))) I thought this movie was very well done good storyline very funny as well. McConaughey & Hudson make a perfect match on the silver Screen. This is more like comedy - Romantic - Adventure. It's a good movie check it out you won't be sorry!! I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!! De Niro & Pacino were the movie they were awesome. You people take movies way to serious, instead of trying to enjoy them. Non-stop action, suspence and had you goin one way and at the end you find out you had it all backwards. I give the movie a 5 of 5 stars. If your a true fan of De Niro & Pacino you'll like it!! I'm sure I can't say anymore than what has already been said, but I'll try. One of the best movie I've seen in a very long time. A great movie to watch with your family. It had a great story to tell. check it out if you get a chance you won't be sorry! I thought it was a great return for MR. HODDER, even though you still don't see his face much.

I liked ""THE RING"" the rest of the japanese remakes next to this one don't compare. Personally I thought this story was unique, even though there were some parts of the movie that weren't original. Over all I liked it better than the ""The Grudge"" or ""The Eye"". This movie will not change my oponion about Sushi!!LOL I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!! I thought it was very inforative, everyone kinda telling their view on being in the most popular horror series in history!! Even though I still say Kane Hodder is the best JASON!! Man it seems like 30 years have gone fast!! LONG LIVE THE KING OF HORROR...JASON!! I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!! This movie was ok, not a high budget flick. It stays in the tradition of the MAFIA genre. Not a ""GODFATHER"" or ""GOODFELLAS"". I rate this DVD a 3 of 5 stars!! This movie was just about the most boring movie I've ever seen...about bedtime!! If you want to watch something to help you fall asleep this is the one!! I rate this dvd a 1 of 5 Stars!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D," Standard unpopular boy dates popular girl to become popular.  This is a classic from the 80s and I still enjoy it today.  It's even fun to laugh at what we used to wear and what our hair looked like back then.  Story line is very good and the acting is good for a group of teenagers, the adults were actually the bad ones in this film. I've come to really like Pixar productions.  Good movies, good story lines and just enough underlying adult humor to keep the parents engaged.  This story is cute, one that I'm sure will be a hit with the little ones.  Great animation, big star voices and a good story line that offers some life lessons.  One to add to the library. This was a good kids movie, it didn't keep the attention of my 2 year old as much as other movies, but I really enjoyed the story and the humor of the movie.  I do think this movie is worthy of a sequel and may have the following similar to Sherk, so I think it is worthy of another storyline. Strange as it may seem, I've watched this movie a couple of dozen times and seem to enjoy it each time.  I also pick up on additional pieces of the plot that I missed the time before.  Heath Ledger does an excellent job of getting you to root for him through out the movie and feel his pain during his challenging times.  One to add to the library. Follows a pregent girl that is left at a Wal-Mart by her boyfriend as she learns and grows while providing for her new daughter.  This shows her going from nothing to having it all and the hard work along the way.  It's great because it didn't just occur over night, it too years for her to get everything that she ever wanted and the challenges that she had to over come to get there. This is an inspriation movie that helps you take pause in your life and consider possibility.  Nicolas Cage has once again done an excellent job of taking the character and making them real.  This is a movie that I share with my family and that we all enjoy and talk about.  It's in my library and shall remain their for quite some time. Really great effects and sound that will truly test your home theater quality.  The storyline suffered until the second half of the movie when the Terminator starts filling in the pieces on what's going on and why.  Then there is a bit of a surprise at the end that in hind-sight fits the movie.  Overall, get the movie because of the effects, not because of a storyline, this way you won't be disappointed when a minor one shows up. If you liked the first one, you will probably like the second one.  It follows much the same pattern.  There are dizzy blonde under tones and the underdog trying to do so much in an unjust world.  It was cute and fun, nothing that had me rolling on the floor, but still cute.  I would suggest watching it, but not buying this one. All of our main characters survive that in reality most if not would have died had these events really happened.  They built a pretty good story around a worst case scenario and the acting wasn't bad, not great but 3 stars.  I've watched this movie a couple of times and I think that's all the life I will get out of it, worth watching, but not worthy of library space. I think Ashley Judd is an incredibly talented actress and usually will watch movies just because she is in them.  But this was a really bad movie as far as story lines goes.  I came away from this movie feeling very little, mostly that I wasted 2 hours watching.  No inspiration, no thoughtful moments not even a just plan good entertainment.  I hate to say it, but skip this movie. I usually like Jackie Chan movies, clean, funny, action, good stuff.  And this one had Claire Forlani, awesome, and then Lee Evans.  I think the story line didn't fit the acts and was just too much for people to take in.  Acting was okay, but there was just too much far fetched and unanswered questions to make this believible or interesting.  Really, skip this movie, don't watch, don't buy! Pretty predictable if you watched the first Dirty Dancing.  Still some good dancing in this one and it was good for a movie with next to no know actors in it.  I found the activities going on during this period in Havana more interesting then the story of the main characters.  Good to watch, not good to own. All the greats, Dracula, Frankenstein, Werewolve, even Jecke & Hyde make an appearance in this film.  The movie is dark and sometimes the plot seems a little thing, or the director introduced something but never returned to it.  The movie is good basic entertainment, if you are looking for a high-grade movie or classic, you should probably look elsewhere.  This was great for entertainment, but I didn't add it to my library. Really great effects and sound that will truly test your home theater quality.  The storyline suffered until the second half of the movie when the Terminator starts filling in the pieces on what's going on and why.

Heath Ledger does an excellent job of getting you to root for him through out the movie and feel his pain during his challenging times.  One to add to the library. Okay, same story line, rich person gets too comfortable, someone else is running the show, makes mistakes, rich person has to have a reality check and fix the world and everyone is better off because of it.  It was still a cute movie.  Suggest you watch, but don't buy. Strange as it may seem, I've watched this movie a couple of dozen times and seem to enjoy it each time.  I also pick up on additional pieces of the plot that I missed the time before.  Heath Ledger does an excellent job of getting you to root for him through out the movie and feel his pain during his challenging times.  One to add to the library. This is a rather long money but the story is strong and the acting is great.  There are two kinds of people as there are movies, good and bad.  This was good.  Just be prepared for a long sitting. Cute, but he humor was more Adam Sandler style.  Some predictable parts, but for the most part, great scenary and some really funny scenes.  Nichole Kidman pulls off an impressive performance as well.  Worth the watch, but not recommending owning this one unless you are a true die-hard Adam Sandler fan. Nothing too complicated, but sometimes that is what you are looking for and in this case, the good guys come out on top without too many surprises.  Looking for something simple and light hearted, look no further. There are some great actors in this movie and I'm mostly interested in the tie in with the Avengers and SHIELD, which still left many open questions that will be interesting to see in the Avengers movie when it comes out.  I wasn't a big Thor fan in the first place, but this movie helped convert me over.  Worth a watch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ASD4YBL5C9CV8," ...kind of prophetic, so it's now time to look back, and get some relevant sequel involving the successor (unfortunately) to Clinton. The title could be ""Wag the Bush"", and should get at least a few Americans wondering about what is worse : having a smart president doing a fine job and getting some fun from time to time, or getting some jerk whose idea of fun is f.....g the world ...a small ending to Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""'s review by telling that a very significant thing is (like in real life) that the only decent and nice guy is the one who gets killed. Of course, American people seem to think that getting rid of those who make life miserable for those around them would not be compatible with 'Beauty' as they see it. Cast and crew are perfect. ...they didn't get a real director to try getting this worthy of being viewed, especially with such a cast..... I strongly suggest Mr. Robert Schwentke looks for some other work he could do (if there is) because I don't think any apprenticeship will be of any use in this kind of line for him.... ... that with Jane Fonda and Robert Redford in a Neil Simon's play there would be some entertainment. But, because of (and no thanks to) Gene Saks' unability to be a real director, the result was pure crap, no matter how hard the leads could try : they were not given a chance. We must consider to be very lucky his output was so tiny.....The least Neil Simon could do would be to give excuses for helping the production.... ,,,is ""generally considered their best work together (Anthony Mann-Jimmy Stewart) and one of the finest Westerns ever made"". That has to be THE reason why, although out of stock in VHS, it's the only one not yet released on DVD. The studios are really too busy getting all the crap released first....What a shame (I don't think they know the meaning of this word).... We're (not) sorry for keeping you waiting the releases of good movies on DVD, since we are too much busy releasing truckloads of all the crap from TV (sorry for the redundancy). We consider essential to give priority to vulgarity-lovers who enjoy the uninterrupted flood of trash. After 'Iron Age', 'Bronze Age', 'Renaissance', you have to realize we've now fully entered the 'Vulgarity Age', and that 'Quality' is not any longer politikally korrekt. Maybe they think that, by butchering widescreen formats, it will help to fight piracy (although I'm sure some nerds will like to pirate crap, just for the fun of it), but for me (and, I can see I'm not the only one), the only result of disrespect for original movies' format only helps in not buying until movies are released in the right screen ratio. First you're attracted by the price, and then, if you already got the misfortune of acquiring Madacy's product(s), you know it's not even worth that price, since they usually manage to get the worst print they can fish from garbage AND then succeed in making it worse. The fact they're not yet out of business is only the proof for garbage lovers (I've been conned twice, and that's more than enough) being innumerable. What a treat!  If you enjoy pure/sheer acting finely achieved by great performers (the director is so good that you forget about him while watching the 'show'), this is one of the most perfect I've ever seen. ... that mr. Bradbury was 'making' movies for 6 years old retards who could not imagine there was any life after 4. But I wonder what else he could have been able to be used for, except maybe compost, provided some tests been made before, to be sure he wouldn't have been poisoning the land (they didn't know at this time the poisoning was already out of control)!!!!!! ... for this movie to be released by a real studio. Madacy not being yet out of business is only the proof that crap's lovers are far from being an endangered species. Whatever the price it's still much too high for their products. ... for this movie to be released by a real studio. Madacy not being yet out of business is only the proof that crap's lovers are far from being an endangered species. Whatever the price it's still much too high for their products. ...for the movie (at last!!!), the quality of the transfert, and the ""special features"" interviews (as good as the movie).    I'd like to see some subscription which would allow the showing of this movie at the White House (Once upon a time ""white"" meant clean or clear). Although I'm quite sure it would be useless, every one should get a chance to have some sense coming to him. ... (and as much disturbing as it is significant) since it's ""based on a true story"" is to see a country where they can allow some people to be judges who are capable of seeing proper that some future ex-wife who can't stand a honest husband is wanting to go to Las Vegas to raise their son....

AA6KE4ZQVBVSP," I bought this for my sister for Christmas.  We loved the Spice Girls in elementary school and we had this on VHS when we taped it off the TV.  So great to have it on DVD, I just need to buy one for myself! A childhood classic.  I loved the Olsen twins when I was little and I'm glad that I can get a piece of childhood on DVD.  I love to bring movies like this one with me when Im babysitting, getting a younger generation into some of the classics from my generation is always cool! I loved this movie when it first came out and I was able to get it for such a great price on here that I was happy so relive my childhood.  My friends always tease me for my 90s nostalgia but how can i resist? Easy to watch for kids and adults.  As an adult watching a lot of kids movies can be annoying but this movies is cute and entertaining (Unlike some other winnie the pooh movies).  2 year old can sit through the whole thing and is so engaged, loves all the characters!  I'm glad I came across this one to add to The Many Adventures of Winnie The Pooh! Such an amazing piece of film.  This movie will have you so engrossed you won't want to get off the couch.  I love this movie and find myself always coming back to it every few months to watch again! This was a amazing movie. Drew Barrymore goes somewhere she hadn't yet gone to as an actress and I think that this movie really brought out a lot in her.  Since this movie was based on a true story (read the book!!) it had a lot of touching moments that stay with you for a while. I love this movie.  I have been a huge Hilarie Burton fan for a while, which is the reason I decided to watch this film.  Very easy to watch and easy to follow horror movie.  If you like horror movies and aren't overly critical you'll probably enjoy this one. I got this as a birthday gift after it had been sitting in my wish list for months.  It arrived in perfect condition and a day earlier than expected.  I get that people don't love the packaging but I don't have a problem.  The discs are protected and the entire series takes up about as much space as three seasons instead of nine.  I love that I have Rosie to watch whenever I want! I love this movie.

I first watched it on Netflix with a friend and we both fell in love with the simplicity of it.  It is such a well made movie and the subtitles are not hard to follow.  A great find for anyone that loves the horror genre. What a great Indie movie.  I first watched it only because so many characters in the movie where being played by actors that had once starred on One Tree Hill (My Favorite Show) and I'm glad I checked it out, such a quality indie movie that I love to watch again and again! I grew up on this show and fell in love with it back in the 90s.  I am so excited to be able to own it and watch it whenever the mood strikes.  The price and quality are great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5," Yeah, I could have said ""hinky"" and that fits, too.  NCIS matches excellent, realistic forensics with a gritty police drama.  The show is thoroughly enjoyable in the first run and worth buying as a DVD to enjoy again. It's a tale within a tale.  A mother and daughter are alone in the bush while her husband is away on business.  The mother is sharing her book about Australia's wild horses with her daughter.  As the mother and daughter learn their own lessons about the bush by helping a young kangaroo, the phantom silver stallion is born and pitted against both nature and man.  Beautiful scenery, well cast.  The recording was a bit difficult to hear. Tim Burton's worldview isn't quite like anyone else's, but that's what makes ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" such a treat.  Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, is tired of Halloween.  He kidnaps Santa, thinking he can do a better job and ends up creating the halloweeniest Christmas ever.  Some sensitive kids and adults may be disturbed by the imagery and the fun Burton pokes at the holiday.  Definitely for more mature children only. If you like complex, action filled films with a mystery element that keeps you guessing, this is definitely your film.  Perfect?  No--that title for me goes to the film where this film's title came from, ""Casablanca."" Hugh Grant stars as the hapless surveyer who has the dubious fortune of determining if mountains truly are.  When he discovers that a town's prized landmark falls a bit short, he's coerced by a local lovely into re-measuring.  What he doesn't know is the whole town is going to build a mountain while he's otherwise occupied.  This is a laugh a minute film and definitely one to be bought and kept for a day when you need cheering. In a remote Irish village, two natives discover their neighbor Ned Devine is a lottery winner.  Upon hearing the news, Devine passes away.  In order to keep his prize, the two men set out to impersonate Devine.  The plot gets more convoluted and hilarious as the whole town gets involved.  This is one you'll want to watch over and over! How could they have topped ""Fellowship of the Rings?""  The casting, scenery, music has become so entangled with the book that they're virtually inseparable.  Plus, this addition gives us 43 minutes enhancements to tell more of the story and the characterization.  I love getting lost in Tolkien's world for 3 hours or more. I watched it again in anticipation of seeing ""World's End"" this weekend.  This is one disk that I bought and kept so I can see it whenever I need a swashbuckling fix.  The movie's one non-stop fun ride and well worth seeing first in the theatre and later in your own home. The DVD was a great way to catch up.  Grey's is turning out to be one of my all-time favorite shows.  There's good characterization, drama and a lot of interesting medical cases.  My only gripe with the DVDs is the music is mixed sometimes louder than the dialogue.  It makes critical pieces of conversation difficult to hear.  Other than that, a very good addition to a TV episode DVD library. Helen Mirren  is one of those amazing actresses that make you forget this is a movie and not the Queen herself.  How she  can keep a 'stiff upper lip' and somehow still convey so much emotion is beyond me.  I was surprised at how much emotion this film evoked. ""The Queen"" is well worth a rental and has earned the top rating for the single viewing; however, I am not planning on adding it to my library. Cases can hinge on haircare--and not everyone is as they seem.  The film was mindless fun on one level, but teaches you really do need to look a little bit deeper sometimes.  Clearly it's fantasy, but a lot of fun. The novel was fascinating, but executing it on a big screen obviously was a huge challenge.  Both my spouse and I got lost when the film flashed far enough  back to change cast members.  Much of the quips were wonderful, dry British humor--and if I just kept up with them, it was fine.  It also helped to have read the book recently enough to make connections with the characters. His favorite TV show?  My husband's got just about everything and he's hard to please.  ""Babylon 5"" has got enough hours for him to keep enjoying for weeks to come after his birthday and years to come.  I wish I had thought of this kind of gift sooner. I don't have words for how strongly I was moved by this film.  Every single woman in this country should see this film before the next election.  We owe these women thanks. Definitely glad I didn't buy the film, but it was great for a watch.  With all the CGI available now, I was really disappointed we saw so little of the dragon herself.  The human action just wasn't enough to keep me intrigued all the way through. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is one of my all-time favorite classics, so I was pretty interested in seeing an Eastern Indian take on the film.  I was in no way disappointed with acting, music, costumes or scripting.  As Mr. Kohli says, ""IT'S ALL GOOD!"" ""Pride and Prejudice"" is one of my all-time favorite classics, so I was pretty interested in seeing an Eastern Indian take on the film.  I was in no way disappointed with acting, music, costumes or scripting.  As Mr. Kohli says, ""IT'S ALL GOOD!"" What's NCIS?  The running question and the varied responses from employees is just one of the quirky aspects of this military mystery series.  Their top notch forensic scientist is a goth, their coroner is Dr. Donald Mallard, aka ""Duckie"".  And their mysteries are also solid and well acted. The episodes are definitely worth owning and watching again.  Admittedly, there are times having rewind helps a lot in this fast-paced series. If you want a pair of really good movies on this type of theme, look at ""Madagascar"" and ""Over the Hedge.""  Both have interesting characters, a good plot and they're not so filled with violent images that might disturb your younger kids. Three generations of the Giorgio family have been in the lobster business in Brooklyn.  When the bank that had their restaurant renovation loan went under, the FDIC insisted on immediate payment--if not the place goes up for auction.  Oh yeah, and it's Christmas.  It's a great tale of a long-time family that struggles and survives, keeping their fight, their ingenuity and their sense of humor. I got interested in Mignola's work reading ""Baltimore"", which I highly recommend.  This film took a bit for me to understand, but I was laughing myself silly by the end of it.  I won't describe the plot, because several others have explained it far better than I could.  It's intelligent, campy, and fun.  If I had seen the pilot on the SciFi channel, I would have voted to develop the series. I doubt I would watch this film more than once, but it's one of the best acted films I've seen.  The cuts between scenes are rough and didn't play well at all on my MacIntosh.  At points, I had to use the menu and just play scene-by-scene.  The documentary portion of the set is very interesting, but I do not believe that any of the deleted scenes would have made a better film. He's one of those rare actors that can't be pigeonholed into a role or type.  For a while there, Ed Harris simply was Beethoven and we were watching him slowly wind down his life til he went out in a blazing hymn.  I wouldn't buy this film to watch over and over unless I was a very strong classical music fan, but ""Copying Beethoven"" was well worth watching at least once. The story occurs in a series of flash-forwards and flash-backs moving play by play like a chess game over many years.  If you miss a caption, you're struggling to figure out just where and when you are.  The film's an interesting bit of history, but hardly worth the thriller designation.  For the most part, it just ground on. Why is Liam Neeson and his posse after Pierce Brosnan?  Is Brosnan a bad guy?  The way Neeson's crew behaves will keep you wondering.  As Brosnan struggles to keep ahead of his dwindling pursuers, the mystery is slowly peeled away.  My only deduction is for the length of the film.  Otherwise, it's a grand Western in the strong old style.  Well worth watching and purchasing if you are a fan of Western movies. After her brother dies having not made the decisive kick in a soccer game against their school's arch rival, Gracie determines to join the boy's team and win one for her brother.  She has to prove herself with literally everyone from her parents, the coach and other players, to the school board.  ""Gracie"" is not just good general family fare, it's a film for every young girl in athletics to see just how far womens sports have come. If you like complex, action filled films with a mystery element that keeps you guessing, this is definitely your film.  Perfect?  No--that title for me goes to the film where this film's title came from, ""Casablanca."" Unlike ""Pride and Prejudice,"" Evelyn Waugh's novel did not shorten well into film. Instead, ""Brideshead Revisited"" is too heavy-handed and overt, losing the lovely shades of meaning that the series possessed.  The scenery is lovely and the cast attractive, but if you want the full effect of the novel as this reader thinks the author intended, try the mini-series in the link below instead.  <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brideshead-Revisited-25th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000GYI3DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brideshead Revisited (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a>  Rebecca Kyle, May 2009 His favorite TV show?

APOGXH3A74CM3," This movie was mildly entertaining.  Very thin on a plot that is barely plausible.  I watched it to see if it would get any better, it didn't.  I watched the whole thing, so it wasn't a complete bomb, just very dated. I've watched this at least a dozen times and it never gets old.  A tight thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and has held up well over the years.  A classic. Bruce leave used a simple plot to tie together the best fight scenes ever captured on film!  Forget Enter the Dragon.  If you want to see Bruce Lee at the top of his form, this is the movie!  The fight between Bruce and Chuck Norris will have you repeating that fight over and over again, to watch in awe a true master!  Every movement prue poetry!!! Ok, I admit it, I've been living under a rock.  I've heard of this movie, but never actually got a chance to see it before today.  The observations about ""civilization"" are brilliant, and the story is extremely funny.  It's very understandable why this film is rated so highly.  And the line ""Do the noises in my head bother you?"" has to be one of the best.  I always wondered where that came from.... now I know. Things are not what they seem is a dead on description of this film! You're never really sure what is going on, which is the point of course!  Set-up?  Could be, but will the viewer ever really know? Welles' gives the film-loving world another cinematic gem, with plenty of twists and turns, and bits of comic genius to keep the viewer enthralled! I found this to be funny, touching and entertaining.  A cheapskate dad has to let go of his ""little girl"" and some of his money.  The women in his life make it impossible for him to do anything other than go along with it all, and that's what makes it funny.... just how he comes to accept the situation.  When dear old dad does, all goes well and is where the film is touching. Times being what they are, is there much to say about something which might not be saying anything?  Or should one say nothing about something which might be speaking volumes?  Where there is chaos is there meaning?  Is chaos the meaning?  All in all, a lot to ponder and much fun! Like the title suggests some of Aerosmith's biggest known revival hits are on this release.  I think what should be on any compilation is subjective, but I think the point of this release was to gather a lot of hits in one place.  And that they did.  Big Ones is still a good release, and Big Fun to listen to. This movie has it all, comedy, great cast, and over the top action!  You get the feeling that everyone involved with this project had a great time, and I consider it one of Schwarzenegger's best films, if not the best! From the 007 spoof beginning til the tango at end there is never a dull moment in action or comedy! Without giving it away, I'd just like to say this is a brilliantly constructed film in all aspects from the acting, to the lighting, and especially to the storyline. The reward comes as the dawn approaches and the pieces of the story fall into place!  A great film! This film is funnier than the first.  Given the subject of becoming a grandfather, and a dad again at the same time, this gives Steve Martin the chance to really cut loose - and he does!  Throw in a little bit of a mid-life crisis and you have a wonderful comedy! The idea behind this movie is very plausible, cheap and plentiful power.  Whoever controls that is in a position of great power themselves, which is what drives this story.  The corruption that this could bring about isn't something to be taken lightly, and we see that portrayed here.  An interesting film, with lots of action.  Well worth a viewing. This film works on so many levels, and is such a heartwarming and uplifting tale.  Part of what makes it work so well for a Western Audience is the cultural nuance, as well as a quirky cast of characters that bring so much to the film and that one can relate to in one form or another.  Can't wait for the DVD version to come out! May the Alien franchise Rest In Peace.  With a very thin story line, questionable acting, and marginal special effects, this movie is a little less than entertaining! Of the franchise, Aliens will remain the classic! If you too suffer from the fate of inhabiting a cube farm, I think you'll enjoy this film. There is a range of characters that most office workers should be able to relate to, and a wacky set of circumstances that each pursue in their quest for some sort of freedom from the mundane... Funny! I thought it a well balanced action/myth story that moved along at a nice pace and kept the viewer engaged.  Good guys, bad guys, and a little love story thrown in, oh, and a lot of action!  What's not to like? This is a mesmerizing look at the horror of war at a very personal level. It's nice to see a show like this that deals with the oft forgotten Pacific theater, the unique challenges it posed for those who fought in it, and the brutal reality of fighting a war against an enemy that wouldn't quit in one island jungle after another. I'm not one to nit pic over casting changes.  Yes there's a different IP Man in this film, but overall it held up just fine with the other two films.  I found the fighting sequences to be outstanding, and the story moved along nicely.  Having the real IP Man's son in this was a stroke of genius and was the best part of the whole movie. This is one of the best Jackie Chan movies of late.  I loved it.  A well told historical story that is witty, funny, entertaining and action packed. Big fun entertainment all the way around! I watched this with a group of friends and was the odd man out in really enjoying this film.  It thought it well done and thought provoking, and though not perfect, it is well worth watching.  I'll definitely watch this again, and stand by recommending it.  After all, there really could be something out there. This film stands out in its ability to tell a strange and disturbing story.  There are so few masters of the art of storytelling, which makes Christopher Nolan the rare exception.  He has a gift that is unique and compelling, which he uses effectively to bring audiences well crafted movies rarely seen since the days of Hitchcock.  This film is a gem worth several viewings. This movie was very haunting and told through a minimal amount of characters and superb acting.  One character slowly finds the strength to face the truth, while the other has the past come back to haunt him and avenge his misdeeds! Very well done! Though this story may be tried and true, it's Hank's acting that give this film the punch that it has. Without giving it away, Hanks trials and tribulations while on the island really showcase how he's grown as an actor. Very entertaining! This is some fun entertainment, but really more of a comedic parody of hacking and CEOs who run software companies.  It's good for a laugh or two, but nothing super dramatic or anything to be taken seriously. What's good about this movie is the innovative way it's told rather than the story.  If told in sequential fashion, I don't think this movie would have made much of an impression on the viewer or had the impact it obviously did. Well done! Not much to say about this film other than it could have been a couple of hours shorter, and I should have seen it coming (the ending).... Definately a style over substance film! The performances of Ian Holm and Johnny Depp really make this a movie worth watching, as does all the attention to detail in recreating 1888 London.  The story moved along quickly and was very suspenseful, exploring all the little hells of the main characters.  This tied together the story nicely, as did the motive behind it all.  A very interesting take on an infamous bit of history. Almost in keeping with the Mask, here we have a Tuxedo that gives the wearer super powers!  Jackie Chan and Jennifer Love Hewitt are cast well and provide for lots of laughs!  Through his own admission, Jackie has taken a lot of beating and can't keep doing the action packed semi-martial arts flix!  That's okay, this comedy suits him well!  The best scene is where Jackie does a James Brown Sex Machine routine! What can I say... This is an over-the-top piece of cinema that is so much fun to watch! Very well cast and directed.  The sets, lighting, camera work, and editing are all top notch and keep the story moving at a breakneck pace, in a very entertaining fashion. What a great way to bring the musical back to the forefront! Though the premise promises some bang, what you get is a basic dud!  With that said, there are a few over the top moments that are quite fun and make this a B-Movie popcorn fest... This is a very touching and moving film and a fitting tribute to the many heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice during the 9/11 attack on America.  The acting is as it should be, conveying bits and pieces of so many lost lives for the viewer to reflect upon.  This should by no means be considered entertainment, but rather a sincere tribute and thank you to those who gave their lives! This is one the more quirky westerns I've seen, but it's hard to knock.  Very fine performances and stunning photography, it just doesn't quite hit the mark.  That doesn't mean it isn't worth a viewing or two... WOW WOW WOW!  The performances in this movie were a mile higher than outstanding!  So convincing, I thought it truly was Ray Charles that I was watching.  Every actor was solid and convincing, and the music was wonderful (with Ray Charles providing the music, you couldn't go wrong).  The story was very powerful and endearing, capturing the essence of a true American Icon and legend.  Genius! I was wondering if they'd be able to pull off the cab ride of destruction as a credible thriller.  They sure did!  The acting was  top notch, with Tom as villian and Jamie Foxx at his best ever!  The quick pace and building tension kept me on the edge of my seat. A great summer movie! Best B movie of 2004.  Campy, but very fun.  Fans of the Alien and/or Predator movies won't be disappointed.  A loose storyline frames some very good special effects and action.  An entertaining diversion. This film was entertaining, but didn't cover any new ground.  It was nice to see the familiar characters up to their usual antics, but the story was a bit thin and was probably the reason the movie was so short.  It's really a cable movie that's good for a few laughs. The locations and sets were great, but the performances?  And the story, hmmm?  Though to be fair, it's my understanding that a lot got cut out of the movie.  I'd like to see a director's cut and see if that makes a difference, tough I doubt that will happen.  Fun to watch, but see it on cable. I seemed to get caught up in the subtle complexities of time travel films, and there are plenty of those in Deja Vu.  Given the cast, great performances are a given, leaving the unfolding of the story and issues of traveling through time to keep you guessing until the end.  Very entertaining. Well constructed, funny, and a sublime social commentary.  It took so little... coming out of a closet never entered that changed people's perceptions and behaviors in such strange and powerful ways.  Using this to its benefit, the movie makes some strong statements in a hilarious fashion.  Well worth watching! This is a tension filled thriller with comic releif!  The fact that you don't see the villian makes this all the better.  This film will keep you on the edge of your seat and hoping the characters overcome their stupidity and make it out alive... Well constructed, funny, and a sublime social commentary.  It took so little... coming out of a closet never entered that changed people's perceptions and behaviors in such strange and powerful ways.  Using this to its benefit, the movie makes some strong statements in a hilarious fashion.  Well worth watching! The story line is simple - good vs. evil, so what really carries this movie are the Matrix-esque special effects and, more than anything, the martial arts. Though subtle, what Jet Li gives us, are distinctly different styles of martial arts and the philosophies behind them.  This is what makes this film a treat for martial arts enthusiasts... Ok, this may a bit thin on plot, but really it's a story of love and passion, and how a person can be blinded by those.  Burned.  Destroyed. Willing to throw everything away.  Consumed.  The chemistry between Banderas and Jolie burns up the screen and really makes this story work.  There are enough twists in the story to keep it interesting.  It moves along nicely and is fun to watch. This is just a remarkable show. There's no other way to sum it up. I captures the brutal saga of what these men had to go through to free the world from tyranny and defend freedom. I'm just in awe of every aspect of this show, the acting, story, sets, photography, etc. A must see in my book. This is a straight up fight film with a simple new twist, it takes place in a prison.  I always enjoy seeing Peter Falk, and the character he plays as the gangster is great.  Once the stage is set, you pick your favorite to win and watch as the fight unfolds.  Great entertainment. Another outstanding performance by Mr. Williams as Sy!  He convincingly portrays a character living in the sterile world of madness set on a collision course with the mad world of ""sanity"". The slow, deliberate build up to this collision is riveting, and builds a strong empathy between the viewer and Sy, until the point where he completely breaks with reality - the conclusion I'll leave to the viewer to ponder (and you will)... This is a straight up fight film with a simple new twist, it takes place in a prison.  I always enjoy seeing Peter Falk, and the character he plays as the gangster is great.  Once the stage is set, you pick your favorite to win and watch as the fight unfolds.  Great entertainment. This is a very fun action comedy that throws together a father and daughter that didn't know each other existed.  Style, culture clash, humor, and fast paced action are what make this work, as well as some fine performances. Nice to see such a well crafted tale of the high seas come back to the screen - it has been too long since this type of story has been told.  This movie makes it worth the wait! This grabbed my attention from the start, taking me on a gritty ride all the way to the end.  The strength of the film is both the acting and story.  Nothing is glamorized or as it seems.  Just when you expect things to work out a certain way, they don't!  Well worth the viewing! I liked this film the first time I saw it solely based on the cast and their outstanding performances.  I liked it even more after seeing it a couple of times for the subtle twists throughout the movie.  Nolte really delivers in this film! What makes this film work is the fact this it IS an over the top genre collision.  Non-Stop action from beginning to end, with the violence pushed to unbelievable, making it easier to take and making this BBBBad in the very good sense of American slang.  QT barrowed from the best, turned it on its ear and made something very new and refreshing out of it! What can I say... Here's another for the genre staple with warewoves thrown in to give it a story...  Watching this a 2nd time, I have to say that this film was well done and the combining of two genres (vampire/warewolf) was a great idea!  All in all, very entertaining.  And which side are you rooting for? I know the movie isn't the book, with that said, it's a good movie.  A movie that revolves around redemption, discovery, and love.  In short the pains and joys of life.  A life best enjoyed when lived, truly lived!  Well acted with stunning photography!  Worth the watch, but don't expect this to be a verbatim re-telling of the book... it isn't! Though you can see it coming, the trouble the police chief gets himself into and his just ahead of being found out efforts to get out of the jam he's in provides some great entertainment and fast paced fun! After catching this series a couple of times I was hooked.  I love the dark, often side splitting humor, not to mention the unique ways death comes knocking....  Wonderful - had to get the DVD to watch this at my leisure and to share with friends!  Almost forgot to mention, there are ""little life lessons"" mixed in with each story.... just a bit of something to ponder that adds to and makes this show work so well! A stunning story and modern classic!  Very well told and acted.  The sets were incredible!  The evolution of the main character was played out perfectly, and the story within the story couldn't have been better.  This is a cinematic work of art! Another movie that I stumbled upon and really enjoyed.  It starts out as a really cool sci-fi flick and morphs into more of an action movie which is why I gave it three stars.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is good entertainment and worth more than one viewing.  I was really intrigued by the sci-fi and wanted to see more of it.  I mean, really, if you knew what the future held would life be worth living? What I thought was going to be a typical war movie turned out to be a paranormal thriller.  Don't let that put you off, as this is an extremely interesting film that will have you on the edge of your seat and leave you with plenty to think about.  I'm very glad I stumbled upon this.  Take note Hollywood, there are still plenty of interesting ways to tell a story. WOW WOW WOW!  The performances in this movie were a mile higher than outstanding!  So convincing, I thought it truly was Ray Charles that I was watching.  Every actor was solid and convincing, and the music was wonderful (with Ray Charles providing the music, you couldn't go wrong).  The story was very powerful and endearing, capturing the essence of a true American Icon and legend.  Genius! I'm all in with this one. I found the film to be visually stunning and the story both interesting and engaging. This is one of the best post apocalypse sifi films I've seen in a long time, with just enough twists and turns to make the ride a lot of fun. Caught this on Amazon Prime streaming video and really enjoyed it.  I don't remember hearing about this when it came out, wish I had as it's the kind of film that would be fun to watch on the big screen.  Lots of silly action and an improbable plot makes this a prefect viewing on a Saturday night.  Good old fashioned fun in action. This movie had just the right amount of suspense to make it entertaining all the way through.  There are several scenes that keep you on the edge and rooting for the protagonist (though you don't know if he's a good guy or a bad guy). This took me a couple of viewings to pick on all the little bits in the dialog that I wasn't familiar with, but even the first time through I really liked all the twists this story took, especially the ending which was a complete surprise.  Entertaining film. I love movies like this, with just enough twists, turns, intrigue, action, and suspense to keep things moving along at a nice clip, while staying interesting.  This moves along the lines of Criminal Minds, with a group of profilers stuck on an island with a killer...  the trick is to figure out who the killer is while trying to stay alive.  Good cast too! This documentary is nothing short of a masterpiece, covering the highs and lows of Mark Twain's career, as he becomes one of America's most important literary figures. It's a riveting look into the life of a genius who changed the landscape of writing and those in his life that influenced his work, that is both insightful and moving. Well done story.  I love the way this slowly builds and unravels, and is never quite what it seems.  Ghost story and mystery all rolled into one.  The production value was great all the way around, acting, story, photography, location, etc.  Fun movie to stream on a Saturday night. Everyone has troubles, and the next guy's might just be worse than yours.  This movie takes a long hard look at that in a contemporary fashion, showing that your really do need to tell someone how you feel before it's too late. I've watched this at least a dozen times and it never gets old.  A tight thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and has held up well over the years.  A classic. Take some interesting characters portrayed by good actors, a lively (though not all that original) story that moves along at a nice pace, add in a few twists and turns, along with a chase or two, and you get some fun entertainment.  A nice movie to enjoy with the family. This is such a engrossing series, it's hard to find anything that comes close to it.  Everything about it is exceptional.... the writing, acting, sets, characters, plots, photography, etc.  In an era that fills so much of television with mindless ""reality"" programming, it's refreshing to have a series such as this.  From the first episode of season one, I was hooked on Mad Men, and couldn't wait for the next episode.  This show is like a good martini.... intoxicating. Yikes!  That's all I could think while watching this weird Lord of the Rings rip-off.  I was intrigued because Jason Statham was in this, I kept expecting this to get better, but it didn't.  Why I watched this until the end is beyond me. This is such a beautiful and intimate film of the Stones in concert.  It's by far the best Stones film I've seen.  This movie showcases a band that has stood the test of time, doing what they do best - making great music.  I like the fact that lesser performed songs are featured.  I found this to be a riveting look at the Stones, almost like being on the stage with them.  Bravo! This is such a engrossing series, it's hard to find anything that comes close to it.

I found this to be a riveting look at the Stones, almost like being on the stage with them.  Bravo! This film was a serious disappointment. Sure, it's got some nice visuals, but the plot barely exists.... the story is like a bunch of loosely connected noodles that try to hold the movie together. Not worth a 2nd viewing. If you too suffer from the fate of inhabiting a cube farm, I think you'll enjoy this film. There is a range of characters that most office workers should be able to relate to, and a wacky set of circumstances that each pursue in their quest for some sort of freedom from the mundane... Funny! I found this a thoughtful documentary into the evolution of a photographer best known in the realm of pop culture.  It touches upon the journey that evolved around Annie and how she came to shape the road of her own destiny.  Very much worth a viewing. You never know if Hollywood is going to blow it when they put out something from a classic genre.  In this case they kept classic horror alive and added to it.  A very entertaining film with great performances. I really like these glimpses into how films come together.  Well done, and entertaining.  The Underworld series is one of my favorites, and this just adds to my appreciation of it. I stumbled upon this on streaming video and was taken with it.  A nice spin on fight movies with an actual plot, some fine acting, and action.  What's not to like? I really like these glimpses into how films come together.  Well done, and entertaining.  The Underworld series is one of my favorites, and this just adds to my appreciation of it. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this was an entertaining spy/action film.  The movie has a plot that comes from an angle that threw me for a bit.  Lots of turns and twists, and action that keeps it moving along at a frantic pace.  I enjoyed it. I enjoyed this film, but don't think it was as good as the first one.  It's a little slow on getting to the action, and doesn't give Micky Rourke enough screen time.  All in all it was an enjoyable follow-up to the first movie, just not filled with many surprises. I'm not familiar with Japanese ghost stories, but found this movie to be very fascinating.  There were few times during the movie where I felt the story could be tightened up (I wasn't sure if I was missing something due to cultural differences) to make it flow a bit better, but overall it was very compelling.  This film was a great introduction to this genre. Lighthearted science fiction that's just fun to watch.  It's the characters that really make the show interesting, the way they play off each other, and the stories aren't too bad either.  The show started off a little slow but seemed to get more interesting with each episode.  Season one had a bang-up of an ending, so I'm off to watch season two to see how things work out.  Good entertainment. The concept behind this film had a lot of potential, but wasn't as fleshed out as it should have been.  I enjoyed the film and found it entertaining (mostly because of Bruce Willis), but it was short.  It was a hoot seeing Ving Rhames in a character you'd never expect to see him in.  Good for a rainy afternoon viewing. A great action/comedy moving that isn't meant to be taken seriously... just enjoyed.  Great chemistry between Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise, not to mention lots of outrageous laugh out loud scenes.  A movie that's just a lot of fun to watch. In a not to be taken too seriously film, Jackie Chan delivers some light heated fun in this action comedy.  Sure, it's predicable and over the top, but it's meant to be.  A nice movie for the family to enjoy on a Saturday night over a big bowl of popcorn. Finally got to see this and found it entertaining, but not much more than that.  This film garnered a lot of undeserved hype which seems to be just as much of an indictment on the shallowness of our culture as the film was.  There's nothing groundbreaking about this film.  Flash in the pan entertainment at best. This is a highly enjoyable film with a great cast that's a lot of fun to watch.  My friends told me about this movie and I finally got a chance to watch it and can see why so many people like this film.  Lots of action and gags to keep you laughing and on the edge of your seat.  This is perfect when you need an action comedy to lift your spirits and keep you entertained. Very entertaining, and it really stands alone from the original movie.  Hailee Steinfeld steals the show, her portrayal of Mattie Ross is brilliant.  Hands down she's the one with the True Grit and really makes this movie such a treat to watch. Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon weren't bad, but Haille gave this movie some real spark. This was great to watch.  So much to see and hear, that I just couldn't get enough.  Jeff Beck was awesome, as was Robbie Robertson, and Steve Winwood blew me away with with his performance of Dear Mr. Fantasy.  All around, this DVD set is just great.  No flaws really.  Just wish I'd been there to see this in person! I caught this as it aired and thought it was very well done.  David Pogue's quirky sense of humor and enthusiasm for technology really made this both informative and entertaining.  The range of topics and how they were presented made this fascinating.  I didn't know what to expect, and didn't want to watch some dry presentation of technology.... this was far from that. Djimon Hounsou is a killing machine that you can't take your eyes off of.  He really delivers in this film, and keeps the viewer engaged during the fast paced action.  It's always nice to see Kevin Bacon, and his charter adds to this movie in an almost comedic way. Balancing out the action.  All in all, a nice gritty shoot them up film, with a nice twist at the end, that's fun to watch. Without giving too much away, this is a very dark, yet compelling film, where more than life is taken from the characters.  It was interesting to watch the story unfold amongst the back death of the plague and the superstitious beliefs as to what was causing it.  A good movie to stream on a Saturday night, but probably not with the kids. I remember the Apollo missions and this film does a great job of capturing the feel of those missions, and adds in isolation and dread. The movie kept me engaged in the story, and really worked for me. It was very believable, and had me thinking ""what if"" the whole time. I'm not here to compare this film to the original Conan, as other reviewers have already covered that much better than I can.  If you looking for some entertainment that's got plenty of action this version of Conan provides it.  Though very predictable, this film is good and goes well with some popcorn on a Saturday night. A little over the top at times, but really an enjoyable movie for a Saturday afternoon.  I'm really loving the ability to stream movies from Amazon on my Roku, and there's so many movies to get caught up on, and Green Lantern was just one of them. I really had no interest in this movie, but it was streaming and I was bored so I gave it a shot.  The story was strong enough, with plenty of twists and lots of tension to hold my interest.  All the characters are a little more than they first appear, giving them more depth than the usual Hollywood fare.  Fine acting, good story, and a nice twist at the end made this an enjoyable movie. I've seen lots of people compare this to 300, it's not even close to that, nor do I think it was meant to be.  That being said, I still found the movie to be interesting, action packed, and was intrigued by the Greek Mythology incorporated into and driving the storyline.  This is a fantasy story, and not a bad one, made all the better by Mickey Rourke's portrayal of King Hyperion. I don't claim to be an expert on the history or nuances of the Spider Man comics or movies, so I really can't pick these things apart.  I take each movie for what it is, and decide if I like it or not. That being the case, I loved this film.  It was very entertaining, I loved the characters, action, and story.  I'd definitely watch this again.  I hope they make a sequel to this film. This movie is a great prequel and much more than I expected.  The change in point of view and the telling of Caesar's story made this a much more interesting film.  It was a bit over the top towards the end, but by then I'd bought into the story, so it really didn't matter.  I'd love to see a sequel to this film. This movie is sort of cross genre, a ninja western that's a feast of fun to watch.  Lots of action, good story, great cast, and outstanding effects.  I watched this a couple of times before buying it, and liked it so much wanted to add it to my collection.  Highly recommended! This is some of the most brilliant television I've ever seen.  Season one was great, and I didn't really think it could be topped, but I was wrong.  The writing, and the acting have only gotten better, and the modern interpretations of classic Sherlock Holmes stories are fascinating.  Everyone involved with this production is on top of their game.  I really hope that there's a season three, four, five, and so on. Masterful storytelling. A super fun, stylized action movie that moves at a nice pace.  An East meets West movie that is different from all the others I've seen.  Everything is packed into this film, action, romance, revenge, and a bit of a moral story.  Grab some popcorn and enjoy. This was a very enjoyable addition to the Marvel series of movies.  There were a lot of funny scenes as well as plenty of action, and the over the top ending.  Fun! Engaging up to a point, but there are some holes in the story that are hard to overlook. That being said, the movie was entertaining, and had me rooting for Hanna the whole time, even as I was questioning her motives. Definitely something different and worth a viewing or two. A very nice presentation and dramatization of the life of Robert Johnson, or at least what we know of it. I was fascinated with the information and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the music and the story behind it. I'm not sure having Keith Richards and Eric Clapton clips added anything to this, but it didn't hurt. Very nice documentary for the blues fan to watch. I don't know where this movie came from, but WOW it's a lot of fun.  Wasn't sure what to make of it at first, but it's got cross genre style, and enough action to to keep you glued to it.  It's worth a viewing or two.  It's not quite like anything you've seen before. Action and revenge.... now this is my kind of movie, not to mention that it's just plain fun to watch.  Sure, it's predictable," but there's nothing wrong with that.  Just makes it all the more fun when the """"bad guys"""" get what's coming to them. Much better than expected. Sci-fi time travels movies are very intriguing to me", so I thought I'd give this a try not knowing exactly what to expect. What I got was well paced and well balanced story telling with just enough action to keep it moving along at a nice clip. Leaving me thinking that any of us can change the future. A gore fest with thin plot, and over the top blood and guts. Good for a single viewing, but certainly not with the kiddies. I doubt I'd ever bother to watch this again. The first movie didn't do all that much for me (sorry folks, but I thought the first film was a little lame), so I had very low expectations for this reboot and was pleasantly surprised.  It held up nicely and was much more fun to watch than I expected.  I'd definitely watch this a few more times. Watched it twice. There's a lot going on here so I watched this two nights in a row, and really liked it. It's more a play off the Bourne franchise, and not quite the Bourne movie most people think it is. That being said, this film is its own animal and well worth a few viewings. I was surprised I watched this film, let alone liked it. I'm hardly a Woody Allen fan, finding most of his films tedious endeavors that one has to force themselves to sit through. All that aside, this is an enjoyable film and makes a good point, that the past is best left behind and hardly worth thinking about. I love a good spy movie and this fits the bill.  Just enough intrigue and twists to keep the story interesting.  The acting was just fine, and the plot took a couple of unexpected turns.  Good entertainment and well worth streaming on a Saturday night. An entertaining take on the mysterious death of Edgar Allan Poe, his writing, his supposedly quirky personality, and a detective story (which Poe invented as a genre) all rolled into one.  There are lots of little facts about Poe dispersed throughout the film, and the story is compelling and interesting.  This film is well cast and great viewing for the Poe fan. This is a non-stop action addition to the Underworld series, but it's a little short.  I enjoyed the film, but am glad I decided to stream it rather than see it in the theater.  It's too short and barely advances the storyline.  I would have like to have seen a longer film that wasn't so thin on plot.  Good, but could have been better. Shocking disappointment.  I was surprised at this film, and considering the cast expected so much more. Light on story and even the fight scenes were a bit disappointing. This could have been so much better. Shocking disappointment.  I was surprised at this film, and considering the cast expected so much more. Light on story and even the fight scenes were a bit disappointing. This could have been so much better. Top notch storytelling.  This is as good as it gets.  Filled with drama, suspense, action, and a hero to root for.  Edge of the seat stuff recommended for anyone looking for a tragic action story. It seems like lots of folks were let down by changes in the cast, this really wasn't the case for me.  I'm still captivated by the Spartacus series and all its gory glory.  I watched the entire second season in one day, as I just couldn't stop watching.  Lots of twists and turns, and outrageous action.  All in all, this season picks up nicely where the other left off. Watched it twice. There's a lot going on here so I watched this two nights in a row, and really liked it. It's more a play off the Bourne franchise, and not quite the Bourne movie most people think it is. That being said, this film is its own animal and well worth a few viewings. I'd been waiting for a long time to see this film, and finally got the chance to stream it and really loved it. The story unfolds with a growing intensity that keeps your riveted to story, in anticipation of those who've got it coming to them will get theirs soon. The acting was just perfect in my book, and this is a movie I will savor for a few days reflecting upon it. Good viewing. There's a lot going on here and this moving is worth viewing a few times to take it all it, but it's not a game changer when it comes to storytelling, not like I expected it to be. Still, entertaining. I'm just a casual fan of this franchise, but have to say that this film along with the previous one are outstanding.  I was completely engaged in the story from start to finish. There was never a dull moment and all the characters seemed to fit their parts perfectly. It's nice to watch a film like this. It doesn't disappoint. This is my kind of movie.  You've got your bad guy who you can wait to see get what's coming to him, and a good guy to root for.  Sure the story is predictable, but it's enjoyable watching it play out. For most of the movie I was just shaking my head.  Sure they were trying to tell a story here, but they seemed to keep missing the mark, making this an odd and nearly unpleasant film to watch.  It wasn't until the end that this movie managed to redeem itself. I haven't read any of the Lee Child stores about Jack Reacher, but I'm thinking I should add them to my reading list. That being said, I didn't know what to expect when I streamed this, but thought it was great entertainment, and perfectly balanced in the way the story unfolded. It had just the right amount of humor, action, and intrigue. I'll definitely watch this again. Wow!  This movie is great.  Very compelling in the way it is told, getting the viewer very invested in Viktor's story and the reasons for his becoming a hitman, as well as the surprising turn of events that seem to have changed him and his life.  It was the ending that blew me away.  I have to confess I didn't see it coming, but that's what gave this movie so much punch. I understand that this book and now movie have a huge following and I'm in no position to comment on the specifics of the movie vs. the book. All I can say is that I was looking for a little entertainment and rented this and found it an enjoyable watch. Not a bad way to spend some time. Ran across this on streaming video, and thought I'd give it a view. I'm glad I did, as it was very funny and well worth a late night viewing. Recommended. Nice to see some veteran actors cut loose to do what they do best, entertain. This is sort of like Die Hard revisited. That's what I thought the whole time I was watching this. That's not to say there's not plenty of death and destruction to keep one entertained for a couple of hours. It's just if you think you've seen this before, you have, it's just been repackaged. Much better than expected. Sci-fi time travels movies are very intriguing to me, so I thought I'd give this a try not knowing exactly what to expect. What I got was well paced and well balanced story telling with just enough action to keep it moving along at a nice clip. Leaving me thinking that any of us can change the future. This is the best thriller I've seen in a long time.  It plays out perfectly.  The story is very tightly woven, and moves at just the right pace to maintain the suspense and keep moving forward.  The acting was top notch too.  I don't think anything could be done to improve this film.  It was perfect.  Great entertainment from a movie that seems to have come out of nowhere. I've heard folks say that we are in a golden era of television, and shows like this make me tend to believe that. This show is very intriguing, well acted, interesting, with humor, and action... and plenty of twists and turns. Fun, fun, fun. Very good film, with lots of flair and style, though it does seem to be more than just about Ip Man, which is alright I guess, as that subject has become so diluted with so many films about the same person, it's hard to separate fact from myth. As far as a good martial arts movie, this is one that's a joy to watch. A gripping movie with a message, which to put it simply is forgiveness. I thought the performances and the story were outstanding and that this movie deserves more credit than it gets. Well worth a viewing. This movie never really gets off the ground. It's a predicable father-son story, where they try to bridge their differences and come to some sort of understanding of each other, as the son goes through a survival rite of passage and the father begins to see his son as a man rather than a boy... all within a sci-fi pretext that just moves along a bit too slow, and never really drives home the story. Jason Statham can act, and this film gives him the license to step out from his typical roles, though I have to admit those are great films for him. That being said, it's nice to have him in a film with a bit more depth to it and watch him spread his acting wings. A well balanced story of redemption for a very flawed man. I fell in love with this modern BBC version of the world's greatest detective aka Sherlock.  I look forward to each new installment and have yet to be disappointed in any of the shows. Bravo! What a great B movie action movie to stumble upon. This movie knows exactly what it wants to be and does a great job of being that. Very funny, and lots of action. Quirky, but really nothing new here. In fact it's a rather forgettable film that follows a formula and sinks to trashy depths at times to try and get some laughs. Okay for some marginal entertainment when there's nothing else to watch. I found this to be a very thrilling movie, and even knew how it was going to end, but getting there was the fun part. The suspense and the visuals made for one wild ride. I'm surprised by all the negative reviews, but different tastes I guess.  People didn't think this based on a true story did they?  If that's what they want, there's Apollo 13.  This film is more thriller, not meant to be taken too seriously. What a great film, and it's about time that something like this comes along to give credit where it's due. We get to see behind the scenes and see the story and the faces that go with the voices that have blessed us with some of the best music ever recorded. A spellbinding documentary well worth watching. I'll give this three stars for effort, but I might be a bit too generous.  I really wanted to like this film, and in the beginning thought it had a lot of potential, but the story started to fall apart quickly and never recovered, in fact it just got worse.  Very predictable all the way through. This movie didn't work for me. The scenes were too dark (meaning hard to see) and there just wasn't enough Godzilla in the film. The story didn't hold together at all, and you just didn't have enough of Godzilla to root for him, so without our favorite creature getting enough screen time it was hard to stay interested in the move. Not worth a second viewing. A friend of mine came in raving about this movie and said that I had to watch it, so I did, and I loved it. A great depiction of the birth of a whole era of American music. CBGB's is where punk and new wave got started and this movie entertainingly tells that story. I enjoyed the movie, the fight scenes and the message it was trying to get across, but it seemed to be missing something.  Subtitles would have helped a lot in trying to get the point across, and the story could have been fleshed out a bit more.  It seemed a bit jerky in the way it unfolded.  Other than that, it's a good movie. This movie had a little of everything for me and I liked it a lot.  It's sort of an offbeat comedy/action film that moves along at a nice pace.  Very entertaining and worth a late night viewing. Another solid performance from Jason Statham, whose acting just keeps getting better and better in my book. This movie is a perfect venue for him to show off his stuff and triumph over evil. Some good entertainment. The movie does a good job of capturing Louie Zamperini enduring hardships that would easily break the average person, and I think that was the point of the whole movie. It's hard to comprehend what Louie Zamperini went through, let alone survived, and it takes a couple of viewings of this film for that to sink in. In the end it was faith and forgiveness that both saved and redeemed Mr. Zamperini. If you accept the premise that you'd want to survive an apocalypse you'd be faced with the same decisions of deciding who should be saved and who shouldn't. It doesn't seem that this group is up to the task. Why save a politician? Something to think about, so, there is some entertainment value. I'll go against the flow and give this five stars. I loved it. Very entertaining, with a bit of everything. Love the twists in the story that keep the viewer engaged. I'll definitely watch this again. Thin on plot, and surprising for a film that could have been so much better considering the cast. Cage's performance was stiff at best and the story was choppy and so predictable. The bar wasn't set very high for this film. The result is just average entertainment. This has to be one of Denzel's top three movies in my book. It's right up there with Training Day and The Book of Eli. This is a well thought out action movie that keeps you in suspense from beginning to end. You just want to see the guys get what's coming to them. The suspense keeps your adrenaline going. Revenge like this is fun to watch. I hope there's a sequel in the works. Keanue Reeves is on top of his game in this non-stop action piece. There's never a dull moment and it's such fun to watch John Wick take out the folks who did him wrong. The perfect revenge flick. Let's hope for a sequel. This is a very powerful and moving film that captures the drama and story behind one of the most important projects of the last world war. From the very beginning I was riveted to my TV as this streamed. Outstanding performances all the way around which served to drive home the tragedy of Alan Turing's death by his own hands given that his work probably was one of the biggest factors in winning the war. This was enjoyable and the story was interesting, but really not all that original. Still, when there isn't anything else to watch go for it. It's a good way to relax for an hour and a half. Some good fight scenes and nice scenery. This movie was a complete disappointment, and didn't really have anything to do with hacking other than as a premise to get you to watch this. Great potential was squandered here, and what we're left with is a mediocre action film that was so poorly edited it's nearly incomprehensible. I had a hard time staying awake through the whole thing. Sad, truly. This is just a remarkable show. There's no other way to sum it up. I captures the brutal saga of what these men had to go through to free the world from tyranny and defend freedom. I'm just in awe of every aspect of this show, the acting, story, sets, photography, etc. A must see in my book. I actually liked this better than Ex Machina, but I seem to be the lone voice in that. Could just be the mood I was in when I watched the films, needless to say I was very entertained by Uncanny and thought that it unfolded at an appropriate pace for the story. Nice twist at the end and worth a viewing or two. Edge of your seat good. The movie takes you on a wild ride that doesn't let it's grip loose until the very end. For folks wanting to visit tired world countries, this film should be a real eye opener of what can go wrong and cure that travel itch. I remember seeing this in the theater and not liking it very much, probably because so much was cut out that it was incoherent. Watching this version made the movie very enjoyable and worth a viewing. This was way better than I expected and I'm very happy about this. Vin Diesel was perfect in his role and the story moved along quickly and had enough action to keep it interesting. Enjoyable. I know this is an older film, but it's very enjoyable.  I hadn't seen it until today.  Well done cat and mouse, tech drama, that is sympathetic to Kevin Mitnick.  Though the tech in the film may seem a bit dated, I'd say that it's worth a viewing or two. I thought this would be so much better. I was looking forward to seeing it and like Gerard Depardieu, so it was hard not to be disappointed in the end. I kept thinking things would pick up and a very slow movie would get better," but that never happened and I had a hard time just staying away until the end.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A3804ADXG509OR," This cast is awesome! I love this movie! One of my favorites! Julia Robert's performance is incredible! I have seen this movie so many times I can quote it.. which is probably why I can't get anybody to watch it with me!  Must have for any fan!! Intense movie.. intense plot, but an amazing movie! Sam Jackson and Christina Ricci are awesome! The fact that Justin Timberlake is in it makes it even better for me :) Short role, but he plays it brilliantly! Highly recommend! Intense! but a great movie! I loved the cast! Justin Timberlake was awesome as usual! My favorite parts of true stories is the ending when it tells you what happens to each character. :) Loved this movie! Definitely a movie for the collection! Ashton and Brittany make a great couple in this movie! Lots of laughs! These two are brilliant! Everytime I watch it, it does make me sad that Brittany is not with us anymore but she is still hysterical in this movie! One of my favorites! Newlyweds was my favorite show on MTV (until they got divorced and Jersey Shore premiered) :)  I have the complete series and I still watch them to this day! They were so funny and so real. Jessica always made me laugh and Nick is just sexy! Must have! My far one of my absolute favorite MTV shows! I wish MTV was the same! These two were so cute together. Even though the marriage ended and they have moved on and have babies.. I love to look back and watch it. It is my guilty pleasure! I was sad to see the series end, but I guess when a marriage is over so is the TV show :) Still plenty of laughs! I loved these two together! The cast in this movie is amazing! I love the plot, Wahlberg is excellent as is Damon and DiCaprio.. and everybody else! Some laughs in there as well. Brings me home to Boston :) I was at Justin's show at the Garden and having the show on DVD makes me feel like I am there all over again! Love the behind the scenes footage! Concert was one of the greatest I've been too! Rated even higher than NSYNC :) Must have for any JT fan!! Love the story of Mickey and Dickey! and Christian and Mark put it beautifully! Such a great cast! Fight scenes are intense.. but Mark Wahlberg shirtless and sweaty the majority of the movie is enough for me! :) This movie made me laugh from beginning to end! Cameron Diaz is brilliant as the teacher who doesn't give a s***! :) Seeing Justin Timberlake in this movie makes me wonder where all the sexy substitute teachers where when I was in school! I highly recommend! I loved it! I would recommend this to any SNL fan.. or anybody who loves to laugh! These women are amazing and sooo  funny! I watch whenever I need a good laugh. I have seen it tons of times but every time is like the first!! Must have!! I love Keeping Up with the Kardashians. It is my favorite show and I was so happy to finally get this season on DVD. It shipped super fast and was brand new just like they said. :) I used to LOVE this movie as a kid! Now that I am 23 I still put it in my DVD player ever once in a while. MJ was one of the reasons I started playing basketball in the first place. This movie is still super cute and funny!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AMYW43AHO16SS," Harrison Ford continues his top billing streak with this exciting film about terrorists hijacking the President's plane.  He proves his star power in the title role.  Gary Oldman is errie as the leader of the rag-tag group of thugs.  He is one of the best villans in Hollywood today.  Check it out! I can go back to all the performances Robert DeNiro has made over the years, but I can honestly say that this was the best movie he ever worked in.  Yes, DeNiro as Jake Lamotta in ""Raging Bull"" was his shinning path to greatness, his portrayal of Travis Bickle was one that still leaves me with such chills.  Taxi Driver was one of Martin Scorsese's best movies. If you want to see great acting, watch this movie.  Gregory Peck's pressence in this film is awe inspiring.  This is his greatest role in one of the best movies ever made.  I honestly think this was one movie that made a difference in changing the course in the Civil Rights of all people at that time. The movie reminds me of a painting.  Every touch of paint is put on very carefully.  The result is a masterpiece.  This movie also reminds me of the 1950's classic, Sunset Boulevard.  Spacey's character is much like William Holden's character.  Both want to be better than their current state of affairs.  Kevin Spacey gives one of the best performances of the decade.  Sam Mendes' first movie is his finest.  He would be hard pressed to make another as great. This is one of the great movies of the 70's.  The supporting cast in this film reads like a who's who of acting.  Every award this movie recieved was well deserved, especially Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.  (One little word of note.  In the stage play, the role of McMurphy was played by Kirk Douglas.  His son, Michael would work to get the movie on the screen.  Thus, the family connection.) My mother said I could only watch the ""cleaned up"" version on TV when this movie came out as it was too violent back in the 70's.  This movie made me a huge fan of Clint Eastwood.  So much, that I named my cat ""Dirty Harry"".  It's the original and undisputed king of action movies! Paul Newman is riveting as the title character.  George Kennedy deserved his supporting Oscar.  And if you remember the opening music from WABC-TV's Eyewitness News, then you'll remember this movie.  The screenplay is probably the best thing about this movie.  There are so many great lines that come from this movie.  (""What we got here is a failure to communicate!!"")  Overall, this is great movie making!!  Buy it or rent it!! Oliver Stone obviously had his own conspiracy theory about what happened on that cold November day in 1963.  So he made it into a movie with the help of real life New Orleans District Atttorney, Jim Garrison.  The result, an entertaining, but thought provocative film.  We'll never know the answers about what happened, but Stone gives us some food for thought. Pakula did a great job directing this classic.  I love the imagery of this film, the scene set up and the eventual consequences that take place.  Warren Beatty is great as the investigative reporter.  This is one great film!  One of the most underrated films of the 70's! Both Oscars won by Hackman were for portraying brutal & arrogant individuals.  Popeye Doyle is the persona of the 70's cop, ruthless, determined, bold.  It was a well made film that I love watching over and over again.  Many of the scenes were done in my old Brooklyn neighborhood, especially the begining scene which I so remember being in (Bedford-Stuyvesant).  It is New York through and through. This definitely was one of Spike's weaker joint's.  Though it was refreshing to see entertaining musical numbers in his film.  Once again, race is the topic.  However he concentrates on black America's preoccupation with light and dark skin.  At the end of the film, you're bound to get into a conversation about it.  That's the one thing Spike wants, a deep conversation about what we can do to improve relations with each other. This movie had me in stitches the first time I viewed it.  Though it seems very dated, the movie still holds up.  Note the dubbed voice of Arnold Johnson.  That was actually Robert Downey, Sr.  Also notice ""Huggy Bear"" from Starsky & Hutch. It was very much anticipated after the success of ""Westworld"" that this movie would be just as good as the original.  Sorry to say that it doesn't do any good!  Yul Brenner is only in this movie for about 2 minutes, and that's in a dream sequence!!  Don't waste your time on purchasing or watching this retread!  It's a waste of time and money!! David Lean gives the Bolshevik Revolution the grand touch with his pannoramic cinematography and imagery.  Omar Sharif & Julie Christie gave good performances.  But it was Rod Steiger who steals the show with his great portrayal.  The love story was somewhat flat, but was enough to sustain me to watch the full 3 hour epic. Though I liked Dr. Strangelove more, this film is still a powerful, on the edge of your seat thriller.  Henry Fonda gave an unforgetable performance as the president under fire.  Walter Mathau was also gripping as the cold hearted professor.  There are some well known actors that gave supporting roles such as Dom DeLouise & Larry Hagman.  Sidney Lumet was on a role during that time and would go on to direct some great movies. Every time this movie is rerun on Television, I stop the remote and see it over again to pick out some of the incredible and innovative visuals and details Wells made.  The bedroom tantrum scene was years ahead of it time.  This is the greatest movie ever made!! Martin Scorsese was just getting started with his career when he directed this awesome independent film.  This movie has all the elements in future Scorsese films.  Gangsters, violence, etc.  Watch this film first and then see his other works.  It's an achievement of mammoth purportions and a sign of things to come! I've been a listener to Howard for over 20 years now and I'm very familiar with how he evolved into one of radio's most controversial DJ's.  This movie was surprizingly good and accurate.  Howard's performance was very good.  One of the other interesting aspects was his supporting cast.  Most people in their situation would have been out of their element by playing themselves, but they pulled it off.  It was very entertaining and a great retrospect. I was attracted to the movie by my wife who is a big polar bear memorabillia collector.  Though it's only an hour in length, it's scenic beauty will blow you away.  Can you imagine what it looks like on an IMAX movie screen?  WOW! From begining to end, this movie is loaded with great performances and outstanding direction.  They try to make 'em like this and come up short all the time!  Keep this in mind.  This movie only won 3 Academy awards.  No Best Director for Coppola, but thankfully Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Picture and Best Actor by the man who will forever be linked to Don Vito Corleone, Marlon Brando (R.I.P.).  A crowning achievement in American movie making! ...The film is 50 minutes too long and it's overproduced and overacted.  It's too bad!  With a better producer and director, Sidney Sheldon's book could have been great.  I've never read the book so I can only imagine that it's better than the movie. The final last words off a legendary film.  Before self-bannishment, Roman Polanski developed this classic who done it.  Jack Nicholson continued to give one great performance after another during the early 70's with this one setting the stage for an Academy Award the next year.  Another great performance was John Huston as the sinister father.  This is one movie I could continue to watch over and over and over.  It's great filmaking! In between Godfather films, Francis Ford Coppola made this masterpiece.  There are many actors that would go on to bigger and better things.  Harrison Ford, Cindy Williams, John Cazale to name a few.  But it's Gene Hackman's show, who gives his best performance since the French Connection.  A classic!! Given the fact that the movie had the dialogue of a bad Shakespeare play, the film still works as a visual treat.  I just don't like the screenplay.  The movie takes itself too seriously.  Despite it's short comings, the special effects are just incredible and is still worth the price!! I heard about this story back in 1980 when the book came out.  So naturally, I was very interested in how the movie would play out.  The story of Frank W. Abagnale is told with some humor and some melodrama by Director Steven Spielberg.  DiCaprio and Hanks give very good performances in this unbelievable, but true tale.  Not one of Spielberg's best, but very entertaining. As 2003's Charlize Theron was deserving for her Oscar, Jamie Foxx is deserving as well as for his outstanding portrayal of the musical genious.  Director Taylor Hackford waited 15 years to make this film and it's a good thing he did.  I don't think anyone else could have done a better job in the role. The whole gang's back.  Bridget, Mark, Daniel and the rest are in for another year of heartbreak and adventure.  This sequel could have been a disaster in the making. The Thailand angle could have broke the film.  The difference were the performances of Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant.  They give plausable performances and this film probably would have failed with someone else.  Though not as great as the original, it's still fun! I heard allot about the performance of Halle Berry and she certainly deserved the Oscar for it.  But, Billy Bob should have been given Oscar consideration for his performance as I was deeply moved by his potrayal of the corrections officer who goes through an emotional renewal.  The movie transition was slow, but I understood the meaning of what Direcor Marc Forster wanted to give his audience.  Overall, a riveting movie experience! Roman Polanski plays a timid man who takes on the personality of the previous tenant, leading him deep into the world of schizophenia.  The thing that strikes me about this movie are the supporting characters, preferably Melvin Douglas & Shelley Winters as a few of the wierd neighbors.  There are moments when this movie dives into laughs.  But it still holds you into its grip of uneasiness. This is one of the great movies of the 70's.  The supporting cast in this film reads like a who's who of acting.  Every award this movie recieved was well deserved, especially Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.  (One little word of note.  In the stage play, the role of McMurphy was played by Kirk Douglas.  His son, Michael would work to get the movie on the screen.  Thus, the family connection.) Robin Williams is awesome and should have recieved Academy Award consideration for this role.  His character gave me shivers just thinking about it.  The movie is a case study of how loneliness can be a crutch for those who do not get help. I'm still in stitches from watching it for the third time.  No political or religious organization is safe from his wild satire!  Robin is truly a gifted comedian. One of the funniest men alive!! Sandra Bullock tries the old, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" routine for this movie.  This movie was not funny at all.  Even with comedian, Robert Klein in a supporting role, it doesn't take off.  Hugh Grant is wasted in his role.  Overall, this is a dud. This movie brings Carrey back to what he does best, making people laugh.  He really shines as the down on his luck reporter who gets a chance to use God's powers to change the world.  His improvisational skills as an actor is his prized possession.  He's is hillarious!!  Please view the outtakes and deleted scenes as they are just as funny as the movie itself.  Jim Carrey is Canada's finest import next to Molson Canadian beer! This movie had me in stitches!  This third effort is the best of the three movies.  With the help of one of the Zucker brothers, this movie actually makes this so much better than what the Wayans did in the last two films.  Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson are a hoot.  But it's Leslie Nielsen who steals the show as the President!  Watch and laugh out loud! This was Disney's weakest cartoon movie effort in years.  The problem is the script.  There are hardly any laughs.  I laughed maybe once or twice, but it's very inconsistent.  Needed to be funnier.  The music by Alan Menken is still great and the visual colorization is wonderful.  Not the best, but still good enough for the kiddies!! Probably one of the most accuate portrayals of fire fighters and their families in a long time.  John Travolta gives a great performance as the fire chief.  Joaquin Phoenix is unforgetable as the hero.  This is one powerful film.  One that will stay with you for some time. As 2003's Charlize Theron was deserving for her Oscar, Jamie Foxx is deserving as well as for his outstanding portrayal of the musical genious.  Director Taylor Hackford waited 15 years to make this film and it's a good thing he did.  I don't think anyone else could have done a better job in the role. Don Cheadle gives an unforgetable preformance as Paul Rusesabagina, a Hotel Manager who shelters Tusti's in his 5 star hotel.  Nick Nolte gives a solid performance as the UN commander who is powerless to stop the bloodshed.  Terry George directs this movie according to detail.  He leaves no stone unturned.  This is an indictment to the world for turing their eyes to this monstrosity.  I hope everyone views this movie with the intention to stop man's inhumanity to man. This was ""Hanoi Jane's"" comeback?  If that's so, she should have stuck with writing memoirs and making execise videos!  This film was unfunny and absolutely brutal to watch.  Jennifer Lopez was a complete disappointment.  Wanda Sykes was wasted in a role that could have been hilarious.  What the film could have used was a complete screenplay makeover.  Neil Simon, where are you when we need you! This documentary was first shown as a expose` on the PBS series, Frontline.  It started a trend.  It asks the hard questions about how Wal-Mart became the world's largest retailer, and at what cost?  It is not preachy as with Robert Greenwald's version and it's not biased like Michael Moore.  It gets both sides of the arguement to explain themselves and it gives the viewer the chance to decide.  Very powerful journalism!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3GA09FYFKL4EY," Ford plays a president whose toughness nobody can deny! When his plane is hijacked by terrorists, he sends everyone else to safety, including the Secret Service, and goes after the bad guys himself to rescue his wife and daughter. Harrison kicks major(...)and his furious, grated line, ""GET OFF MY PLANE!"" will forever be a classic. This one is not to be missed. Move over, Han Solo....Ford outdoes himself here! The soundtrack is outstanding, the story is true-to-life: teens spending a day in detention. I did find it somewhat unconvincing since the actors playing teenagers so obviously aren't, and the ending is disappointing. When they return to school on Monday nothing will have changed much. The outcasts will still be outcasts, and they'll all ignore each other despite the one-day of pseudo-bonding. Nice date movie though. Everyone who remembers this Disney classic fondly will enjoy sharing this timeless gem with a new generation. Dream with Cinderella, plot with her delightful friends the mice, hiss the wicked stepmother and her evil daughters, and hum along with ""Bibbidy Bobbidy Boo"" and ""A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes"" with a new generation. You're never too old to enjoy or dream, and you still remember the lyrics, don't you! Anne Rice's fans won't be disappointed with this masterful rendering of her classic novel, even the ones, like moi, who were outraged when Tom Cruise was cast as Lestat. Cruise more than delivers, and Brad Pitt oozes sex appeal as the tormented Louis. The ending, with Guns and Roses warbling ""Sympathy for the Devil"" is a great, sly touch. Except for some fine performances, this examination into the Kennedy Assassination really doesn't tell us anything new or different. It's hard to be entertained or informed by a movie that simply presents the facts everyone has heard a hundred times. Not even good as a documentary because it's been Hollywoodized. If you like Oliver Stone, watch ""Platoon"" instead because it's a much better film. Still, Star Warriors will want to add this set to the shelf, along with all the various editions of VHS. Relive the shining innocence of ""Star Wars"", the grim drama of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and the campy fun and stunning special effects of ""Jedi"" once again. May the Force be with us forever! Which is why it gets five stars. This all-time king of box office bombs entertains by awfulness. Must be seen to be believed. Buy two because you'll wear one out very quickly. Who can forget the tearjerking ending and the big sighs in the theater when Richard Gere carries Debra Winger out of the paper mill? Gotta be one of the most unforgettable romantic moments in film! Streetwise, embittered Gere finds true love with gentle blue-collar Paula and wisdom in the rough lessons taught by Lou Gossett Jr in his Oscar-winning performance. Always a classic! The kids are cute, and it's an interesting premise, but doesn't fit, especially after H20 was released (Jamie Lee Curtis' character Laurie had a son, not a daughter). Michael Myers' motivation for stalking his niece is never revealed, and the ending leaves it open for yet another bad sequel. The best thing about this version is that we get to see Donald Pleasance again. The viewer has to suspend belief too many times for this to be really scary, and the cute kids get to be too much after awhile. All the worst cliches are resurrected....teenagers are killed having sex, etc. The most interesting thing about this flick is the ending....who saved Michael Myers? Lucifer, maybe? It's even more unsatisfying that we never know. Romero's low-budget gorefest is still one of the best horror films ever made. This new edition is a must for the serious horror fan's collection. ""They're coming to get you..."" and fans of this zombie romp are ready for this one! Michael Caine said he made this movie because he wanted to buy a house and needed the money, and even though moviegoers might hate the movie, he's sure they'd have loved the house. Well, Michael....it's a classic because it's awful. Buzz your way through this dreadful killer bee bumblefest and have fun poking fun at it! Based on Gale Sayer's autobiography ""I Am Third"", this movie is the true story of Gale and his friend and teammate Brian Piccolo, whose tragic, untimely death to cancer robbed sports of a talented athlete and humanity of a gifted man. An excellent tale of sports, camaraderie, perseverance, personal courage, friendship and the triumph of the human spirit. Bring a box of kleenex to go with the popcorn. You'll need it. Hotshot cops Keanu Reaves and Jeff Daniels race the clock to rescue helpless hostages from a mad bomber.  The title is well earned as this edge-of-your-seat thriller keeps the energy level at a constant high pace. From an elevator rigged to blow to the runaway bus, the bomber stays one step ahead in a fiendish game of cat and mouse. Highly recommend! This movie is entertaining, but not as good as ""Tombstone"" which was released about the same time. Kostner's Earp comes off somewhat flat and the script, while giving a hard, authentic look at life in the wild west, lacks the snap of ""Tombstone."" Recommend it instead for the better casting (especially Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday and Sam Elliott) This is one of those movies that you've gotta love because it's so awful. Bad costuming, low-budget special effects, terrible acting - what more could a film fan ask for? Great campy fun, and an absolute howler. At last the first nations of America get their due! For too long people have ignored the fact that in building one nation, the USA, hundreds of others were destroyed. The triumphant, rich culture of native tribes is explored and explained as well as the tragic, despicable acts that destroyed them. A must for historians, Native American history buffs, the native peoples, and should be required viewing in history classes. This 70s spinoff introduced Mork from Ork, the idiot alien who was probably sent to Earth to get rid of him. A must-have for fans of Robin Williams and 70s tv, and fun for anyone else. Admit it folks - yes, it was dumb, but we watched it and we laughed. Antonio Banderas sizzles as the vengeful Mariachi, and Steve Buscemi and Cheech Marin, as El Mariachi's best friend and the bartender, do a splendid job in roles that were unfortunately overlooked by the critics. A great followup to El Mariachi. It's violent and bloody, but hey, these bad guys deserve it. Salma Hayak is alluring as the Mariachi's love interest, and the one-liners are great. Check it out A shameless attempt to cash in on the series and make more money off the title. Could have been interesting with the return of Tommy Doyle, who's so terrified of the boogeyman, but the bad script ruins it. Rent the original and avoid this The ultimate gross-out good time, ""Dawn of the Dead"" is still one of the best zombiefests ever made. Everyone who has ever fantasized about being locked in a shopping mall overnight will find something else to dream about - or hope they will. Bon appetit! The only reason this poor-quality horror flick is in the ""Halloween"" series is because of its title. It isn't even scary, just repulsive, with its victims being small children. Avoid at all costs. Putting this on DVD is a waste of bytes Although the plot is rather simplistic - an old-fashioned, shoot-em-up Western transferred off planet Earth, and the special effects are dated, ""Outland"" is still worth a look, and Sean Connery's worth watching any day, even in yet another tough cop role. Three stars for a classic. This movie would be worth watching just for the beautiful Bette Davis (despite her role as creepy Baby Jane) and Joan Crawford (although perhaps Mommie Dearest should have played the other role...) but the story itself still creeps viewers out decades after its release and shows viewers what a REAL horror movie is! A spoof of just about every bad sci-fi movie ever made, this one continues to produce laughs nearly 25 years after its release. Dorothy Stratten, as the lovesick android, shows she had a bright future in Hollywood, had it not been for her tragic murder by her ex-husband. Groan everytime the words ""Blue Star"" are uttered with the resulting heavenly chorus, laugh at the Rock Eater and the Batboy, and enjoy. This one is supposed to be silly. Bradbury's epic came to life with this miniseries which is of course now dated (especially the special effects, which were only tv quality anyway) but it's still a must-see for fans of classic sci-fi and a new generation of Bradbury readers. TEOTWAWKI has come, and Jan-Michael Vincent and crew go looking for other survivors, salvaging what's left. This is a case of the movie being MUCH better than the book, although Roger Zelazny's novel is still a classic. The killer cockroach scene is still a gross-out even with dated special effects. Enjoy! Racer takes on a rookie. Wow. We've never seen that before, have we? The worst thing about this movie are the race scenes, many of which resemble a video game. I'd rather watch ABC Sports' ""To Live and Drive the Indy 500."" That's more realistic AND much more fun. Rating this film is like trying to critic the Mona Lisa - can't be done. It's a monumental achievement and the only bad thing is that Tolkien didn't live to see it. Hotshot cops Keanu Reaves and Jeff Daniels race the clock to rescue helpless hostages from a mad bomber.  The title is well earned as this edge-of-your-seat thriller keeps the energy level at a constant high pace. From an elevator rigged to blow to the runaway bus, the bomber stays one step ahead in a fiendish game of cat and mouse. Highly recommend! If you're looking for a good chick flick, a good beach flick, and a good surf flick, this one's for you. Champion girl surfers vie against each other and their own personal fears in the world of competitive surfing. The surfing scenes are awesome and Kate Bosworth and Michelle Rodriguez deliver fine performances as the water nymphs. ...is that Tolkien himself didn't live to see it. Jackson's magnificient rendition of the fantasy classic is a tribute to the genius of JRR Tolkien and more than does justice to the novels. The battle scenes, with their realistic depictions of monsters and mayhem, will delight fans of the epic novels as well as attract new ones from moviegoers. That's NOT Entertainment, folks. The plot's thin even for a movie musical, with murderess Velma going to jail for murdering her lover interspersed with musical numbers meant to show her dream of being a jazz star. It's simply choppy and downright DUMB. Either make a murder mystery or a jazz musical....putting both together just doesn't work, especially with a character nobody should have any sympathy for...an adulteress and killer who is completely brainless to boot. Don't waste your time. Nick Stahl's acting is somewhat wooden - I'd rather have seen the actor from T2 return - and Linda Hamilton's presence is sorely missed but T3 still entertains. Ah-nold hasn't lost anything as the killer robot and ""is back"" with more great lines, and the story still thrills.....Judgement Day is on and can't be stopped. Worth watching. Check it out. This movie is too much fun for words. Swashbuckling heroes, fabulous one-liners perfectly delivered (especially by Johnny Depp, who outdoes himself as Jack, excuse me, Captain Jack), dazzling duels....this one's got it all. Move over, Blackbeard, Jack has arrived. Harry Potter and friends continue their magical journey at Hogwarts while bedeviled by Harry's old enemy - or is he? Adults can indulge their inner child while kids learn valuable lessons about friendship and loyalty. Highly recommend! and the music alone would make this worth seeing...but Taylor Hackford's direction and a splendid script, plus masterful performances by Foxx, more than do justice to the late great Ray Charles. Foxx IS Charles in the performance of his career, and reminds us of why we miss The Master. Highly recommend This flick put me in mind of Irwin Allen's disaster movies from the 70s with its overdone plot and Disaster On An Epic scale premise. The laughable dialogue and silly twists entertain only because they're so bad. Frankly, I'd rather watch ""The Poseidon Adventure"" or ""The Towering Inferno"" because the theme songs were better, and although computer-generated special effects are de rigeur today, I still think they look cartoonish Brian de Palma, known for his gory and black themes, doesn't give us anything new and different with (yet another) telling of the infamous ""Black Dahlia"" murder. Since nobody knows who killed Elizabeth Short, and since nothing in this film will change that, it's a waste of your lifespan to view. I hoped for some new, unrevealed info, but found the covers done by A&E and even Unsolved Mysteries to be far more factual and interesting, without the seaminess. The American Western movie lives! ""Yuma's"" gritty story and unrelenting violence may put some viewers off, and the lack of a real ""hero"", but the performances of Christian Bale, Peter Fonda, and especially Russell Crowe are simply outstanding.  I found this movie to be an interesting commentary on human character as defined by choices. Well worth a look. But the screen version of Bradley's timeless classic does its best. An excellent visual version of the exquisite novel for the time allotted. Read the book, though, to get the full power of Marion Zimmer Bradley's masterwork. This flick depicts the worst stereotypes about the south and sorry, I didn't buy Billy Bob Thornton as a man ANY woman would get involved with for any reason. Halle Berry's Oscar seems more for her entire body of work than this flick, which she was wasted on. There is nothing to like about this movie, even if you like grim, in which case rent ""Psycho"" instead, which is what the Academy did when it wasted awards on it One star rating says it all....zero would have been better. Rice's creative genius is notably missing and Cruise's smooth portrayal of Lestat is even more to be mourned.  The only good thing about this flick is the sad last chance to the see the lovely and oh-so-promising Aayliyah, whose career was cut so tragically short. Captain Kirk takes on the Arachnid Empire in this horribly great 70s horror flick. If you can ignore the bad acting, the cheesy effects, and last but not least, the fact that tarantulas don't spin webs, it's worth a look. William Shatner gives a much better performance than he did in most of his classic series, and watching spiders crawl over corpses is always creepy. Low budget classic is well worth a look. ...in the last movie instead of Michael, because it might have prevented them from making this dumb, bad sequel. Put Michael away and give us something new. Stop boring us to death and start scaring us to death! Dawson's Creek fans will delight in the thrills of the first season of this great show - the first time I really watched a teen show and felt like it hadn't been written by adults who thought they were accurately depicting teenagers. The hip soundtrack adds to the appeal - who will ever hear ""I Don't Want To Wait"" again and NOT think of Dawson and Joey? From Dawson's angst to Pacey's Hot For Teacher Affair, it's all here. A great adventure story and wondrous cinematography make this a film not to be missed. Crowe's portrayal of Captain Jack Aubrey is Oscar-worthy and a shame that he was overlooked. ALthough somewhat swept aside by ""Lord of the Rings"" last year, this film is still one of the year's best. An accurate depiction of naval life and excellent performance by the newcomers, especially the young midshipmen. Don't miss it! Fans of 1970s tv won't want to miss this great DVD of the campy series. Or perhaps not so campy; critics may have dismissed this is a ""jiggle show"" but it was one of the first to show strong female characters in an era when women were largely fluff on television. Angels Forever! Wonderful popcorn flick, funny and romantic - and a wry reminiscence for those of us who really DID have the honeymoon from hell. Ashton Kutcher displays his usual talent for humor in this hilarious romp from the aisle into wedded unbliss This is the only show I've ever seen that showed teen life as it really is....relive the fun with Dawson, Pacey (who was the show's most interesting character, Joey and Jen. ...and us, with this hilarious second season of MTV's prankfest. Beyonce ruins Christmas! Halle Berry gets shut out of her own premiere and is so shocked she falls out of her dress! Add Ashton's irreverent humor and you've got the recipe for delicious disastrous fun. We love our celebs, but can't help feeling nasty, evil glee when those who have it all get publicly embarrassed. Can't wait for the third season!!! (Ashton, please punk JLo someday) .....I loved the series but wish I could ask these chicks just one question. While they were acting up, did they NEVER stop to think how their pranks appeared to their coworkers who HAD to work for a living? It's easy to be silly when you've got nothing to lose. Still, it's funny, and I really do like Paris and Nicole. TV's heydey was the 1970s, not the 1950s, and Everybody Who Remembers When will love this collection of the Duke family's escapades. Those of us who know and love Waylon Jennings will especially treasure his unforgettable narration in this classic series. Don't miss it! The awful thing about Dawson's Creek is that the series is off the air. This accurate depiction of young people's lives - from the effects of promiscuous sex, homosexuality, absent parents and mental illness gave something everyone could relate to. Live on DVD, Dawson The Dallas fan's answer to a prayer, the first complete seasons are here in one great package. Everyone who tuned in to find out ""Who Shot J.R."" , who was really the father of Sue Ellen's baby, and just plain loved and loathed the Ewings will want to snatch this up. Larry Hagman's talent as a villain and his versatility from his ""I Dream Of Jeanie"" days is evident in this tv classic. Don't miss it! Forget ""I Love Lucy."" Everyone could relate to LaVerne and Shirley, the working-girl roommates from the beer brewery. Possibly one of the best series of the 1970s. Lenny, Squiggy and the girls are back! Get rid of the old VHS tapes - hasta la vista, baby! - this DVD gives you in-theater quality and awesome sound!!! Linda Hamilton still thrills as (...) mother of future world saviour John Connor, and Arnold just gets more and more buffed as the rabid robot hitman. No problemo recommending this as the best of the series and worth the buy and the music alone would make this worth seeing...but Taylor Hackford's direction and a splendid script, plus masterful performances by Foxx, more than do justice to the late great Ray Charles. Foxx IS Charles in the performance of his career, and reminds us of why we miss The Master. Highly recommend The magic and wit of Jim Henson live on in this timeless classic that you can share you with your own kids while indulging your own inner child. The continuing delight of this video proves that we really never grow up inside. There aren't enough stars for this one GREAT awful dialogue, stunningly cheesy special effects, even a chick named Barbara....what more could a bad zombie movie fan ask for? This one is not to miss. I laughed myself silly. Mild-mannered British diplomat Justin, desperate to solve his beautiful young activist wife's brutal murder, stumbles into a hotbed of lies and greed that crosses international borders. The director blends flashbacks seamlessly into the story, and the viewer can't help but share Justin's grief and admire his wife's courage. The exquisite scenery and horrific warfare of Kenya and the Sudan make this mystery even more thrilling. Thoroughly enjoyed it. The best thing about this movie is, of course, Peter Falk, but listening to him argue over and over with his son, always saying the same things, got a bit tedious, and the fart joke wasn't funny after the first time.  I was disappointed not to see more of Olympia Dukakis.  Still, an interesting take on relationships, and how we never really know our parents. Worth a look. Nick Stahl's acting is somewhat wooden - I'd rather have seen the actor from T2 return - and Linda Hamilton's presence is sorely missed but T3 still entertains. Ah-nold hasn't lost anything as the killer robot and ""is back"" with more great lines, and the story still thrills.....Judgement Day is on and can't be stopped. Worth watching. Check it out. I wanted the entire, uncut wedding, not a news broadcast. This is interesting for fans of Diana, but disappointing to those of us who remember that day and would like to remember it in its entirety. I found this documentary extremely moving and inspiring.  A beautiful, gifted young actress seems to have it all - a promising career in glamorous Hollywood, a doting fiance....yet the call of faith and spirit overrode ambition.  Mother Dolores sacrificed stardom, but found an enduring love that transcends human nature.  I wish her, and her order, all the joys that God can give.

A2KJOWQAADBFM8," I first saw this film on ABC, and I enjoyed it,my little sisters didn't like it very much, but I did,Great Peformance by Harrison Ford. Filled with stunts and action expacially on a plane. I love this movie, its like another version the Terminator series but hes not a machine. Get this movie, tons of action just like Terminator, if u liked T1,T2,T3 u will love this. I watch this all the time it plays on T.V I rent it sometimes. I think this one is a little bit better than the first one, they in Jamacia, yes its better. Jennifer Love Hewitt is just getting hotter and hotter, god I'll smack that ass. But this one is a worth watched horror film. I first saw this movie at my sisters boyfriends house. I watched it and I was pleased, its like a continue with Part 3, he kills the rest of the peaple on the 3rd one. I bought it to my house so my sisters could watch it and they were pleased to. My fav part is when he was in that classroom. It wasn't his stile but the way he enterned and lft was tight. This movie was really good. It takes place in New Orleans which is good becuase i live 3 hours away from it. Van Damne in the cool smooth character with long hair and a earing. I loved the part when he kickes the gasoline can to that dude and shoots the can and the guy blows up. This movie is really worth watching. This one played on T.V and I watched it and i was pretty pleased. A girl when she gets kinda of mad she could move stuff with her mind, so she did by Crystal Lake and she let Jason out, well at the end Jason trys to kill her, well she gets mad and starts using her powers on him, can she finally put this MadDog to sleep or will Jason again suceed. I rented this movie at the Video Store and after i watched this one, I was really pleased. This Halloween is a slasher dasher flick. If u a Halloween fan than get this one, just don't get Halloween 3. But Halloween is really worth watching. I rented this movie and I was a little spooked, its just the way he killed people in this one, and maybe his mask was a little bit scary. If u a Halloween fan get this one, this one is worth watching. But don't let your kids watch this one. I love this Christmas movie its one of my favorites,this is such a great holiday movie for the film that will be watched decades and decades, this is a movie that will always be remembered and for Christmas they will play it over and over because its known has a classic that everyone loves so this is one of these movies that will be remembered forever!! Yea it is great to see 2 Kickboxer films on the same casette if its only 1 and 2,if you wanna see any Kickboxer films, get 1 and 2, not the worst ones, 3 and 4. Get 1 and 2 I liked this movie, filled with a couple of fight scenes. At the end he fights the sandman,across Van Damne kicked his ass. This is a good slambanging Van Damne flick. I watched this all the time, and never get tired of it. Im watching it rite when they on the plane. This is dead ass hilarious, kids could probably watch this, it is funny has hell. Get it if you didn't see it yet. I didn't see this movie in a quite a while, and to tell u the truth, I wanna see it again. This is worth watching, but if u wanna see scary stuff, don't get this movie, but if u wanna see action and blood, get this movie. I found this Free Willy the worst out of the series, not because the movie was bad,it was good but there was some parts in this movie that peaple didn't like. The little kid kinda messed up the bond between Willy and Jesse. But this was still a great movie,what an ending this movie had,Willy becomes a daddy, shocking ending to a great series. I have this movie and I watch ir sometimes when I go to bed and everytime I never get tired of it. What a Halloween sequel, Jamie Lee Curtis saved this movie, I mean if this movie didn't have Jamie Lee Curtis the movie was probably not gonna has good has it is, I mean it could of been good like the other sequels but jamie lee curtis tops it. I found this Free Willy the worst out of the series, not because the movie was bad,it was good but there was some parts in this movie that peaple didn't like. The little kid kinda messed up the bond between Willy and Jesse. But this was still a great movie,what an ending this movie had,Willy becomes a daddy, shocking ending to a great series. The fight i been waiting to see all my life,and it finally happen. The fight was pretty good,Van Damne coudnt keep him down. I ask all my friends what Van Damne movie they like the best and they say this one,I agree with them but my fav is Kickboxer. This movie may be short but its good American Pie 2 made sequels look good, sequels are not usually good as the orignal one, but this one was more hilarious and sicker than the 1st one. Dont let your kids watch this one, just for grown ups, and from ages 13-18. But this is a worth watched sequel. I watched this movie on encore yesterday cause I wanted to watch it becuase everyone told me that it was awesome, and after I watched it I was so pleased,check this movie out if u didn't see it. Now my goal is to see the last 2. T3 is awesome. The woman terminator always has a straight face. She really put up a fight with arnold. I think is its tight when he outsmarts her when he puts that hook thingy in the sewage hole ( talk about getting her face inplanted ) but always..... she is TERMINATED I just finish watching Santa Clause 2 and I was pleased and entertained. This is a good fresh sequel of a holiday movie. This is really worth watching,I don't know which Santa Clause is better, but this one is a must seen Christmas movie.***** I rented this at the store, when I watched it, I laughed, I cryed. One of murphy's best films since Nutty Proffesor. This film is worht watching if u like comedy. Im a big fan of Van Damne,but when i saw this movie i was really disapointed,the setting is dull,the story is dull and the guy he fights dull. I love Van Damnes other movie,but this is the only one that sux. When i rented this movie I was pleased,Jason is just getting stronger and stronger. Alot of explosives,they tryed to kill Jason so many times but they coudnt, I cant wait till Freddy vs jason. I rented this DVD and I laughed my ass off watching it, it starts off when the whole cast is on a wagon and suddenly things fly at them and they run into something and fly off of it. This is like the show but longer and more better. Its worth watching. I rented this DVD and I laughed my ass off watching it, it starts off when the whole cast is on a wagon and suddenly things fly at them and they run into something and fly off of it. This is like the show but longer and more better. Its worth watching. I really enjoyed The Rundown, it is full of comedy and action its everything u need, let me name the famous scenes 1)Rock gets beat up by midgets,really awesome 10/10 2)Rock gets humped by the monkey,funny has hell 9.5/10 3)Rock and Sean get dizzy from that stuff,awesome hilarious 10/10 1)Acting 9/10 2)Action 10/10 3)Plot  8.5/10  Get The Rundown now if u didn't see it I loved this movie after I watched, I mean I didn't expect this much but when I saw it, I was really shocked that it was that good. Jack Black;s character in this movie is awesome, check this movie out if u didnt I enjoyed Scary Movie 3 and I found it better than the second but the first one is the best out of the whole series. Alot of parts you will laugh your ass off and some parts that are dumb, but this a movie worth watching. Yea it is great to see 2 Kickboxer films on the same casette if its only 1 and 2,if you wanna see any Kickboxer films, get 1 and 2, not the worst ones, 3 and 4. Get 1 and 2 I saw the 2nd Terminator before the first one,and when I saw the first one my sisters didn't like it,but I did, my sisters like the 2nd and 3rd one but some reason they don't like this one that much. Arnold is a machine that trys to kill the mother of General John Conner. In future and a soldier protects Sarah from the Terminator. Can Kyle Reese protect Sarah and stop the Terminato, find out and watch this. This one is way better than the 1st Terminator,alot of stunts and explosives, the special effects are way better than the first one,on the 1st one u could kind of tell its a computer but on this one u cant.

A2ODBHT4URXVXQ," Al Pacino plays Satan, a pretty good role for a New York lawyer bend on seducing hotshot attorney Keanu Reeves with the wicked and eternal trio of temptations: power, sex, and money. Reeves just kind of sits there, providing the perfect backdrop for Pacino's over-the-top performance of threatening menace and dizzying mayhem. It's a good ride, and fun to watch Pacino put the devil thru his paces. All the Oscars won by this marvelous Kevin Costner movie were deserved. It's the story of a soldier who, alone, manned a fort in the Dakotas and became a respected member of the Sioux tribe that lived nearby. You've got a romance, you've got an ecological lesson, you've got history, you've got the Noble Savage. You've got terrific character development, beautiful photography, an inspiring musical score, assured direction by Costner himself... It's simply a stunning achievement. Who knew that Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas would turn out to be such a super casting duo? And then add Danny DeVito to the mix as the inept, addled wannabe villain, and you've got an instant winner. The story line revolves around a romance novelist (Turner) accidentally gone astray in Colombia. Douglas is her opportunistic rescuer/ally, and the pratfalls and plot twists keep coming fast enough to keep an audience on the edge of their seats. Perfectly cast Catherine Deneuve plays a wealthy French woman born and raised in Indochina prior to the Communist takeover of what becomes Vietnam in 1955. She has adopted a native girl as her daughter, and the tragedy begins to play itself out as the child grows up and becomes part of the revolution. Lushly filmed, giving a realistic picture of Hanoi and the countryside before decades of war and destruction decimated Vietnam. Yeah, it's a little overblown and melodramatic, but it's also genuine, beautifully acted, and inspiring. Dreyfus is a music teacher at a local high school. He fancies himself a composer, and he is, but circumstances and fate keep him from devoting himself full time to that pursuit: his wife's unexpected pregnancy and the fact that the child born of that pregnancy is deaf. The end is predictably a rousing and emotional tearjerker - but still, it works just fine. Sean Connery and Michael Caine are beautifully cast in this old-timey adventure movie, set in remote Kafiristan. They play a pair of rogues in the grand tradition of epic movies in this satire of British Imperialism. It's very, very funny, and also very sad: a tale that proves the old adage Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. What begins as a romp ends as a tragedy. This one isn't quite mainstream, to say the least. Soft-porn probably would describe it well, but still, I enjoyed it lots, esp the scene in the weird half-abandoned building with the couple making love under a trickling stream of water. Mickey Rourke, fresh from 9  Weeks, again plays a brooding screwed-up millionaire. Lots of kinky sex and titillating background action and dialogue make it fun to watch with someone special. Good sound track, too. With Judi Dench, Joan Plowright, Cher, and Maggie Smith, how could this movie be anything but wonderful? Set in Italy in the 30s and 40s, Mussolini's era, with WWII as a backdrop, it's the semi-autobiographical story of director Franco Zeffirelli's childhood. Beautiful scenery and costuming, beautiful sets, it's in many places a mood piece more than a deep examination of the issues involved. It spite of its occasional superficiality, a very wonderful film with stellar acting. Angelica Huston rocks in Buffalo Girls, in which she plays Calamity Jane. This movie plays fast and loose with history and fiction, but what good 'true' movie doesn't. A great take on a woman's perspective of the Old West. A thriller that just never lets up and keeps you guessing till the last scene, The Recruit is a movie that deals with a new batch of recruits for the CIA undercover section. The training sessions and 'tests' bear no resemblance to reality, but who cares? It's great drama, great plot, great theater - and besides, Al Pacino's in it, so it's all good. Don't miss it. The tempestuous story of the life of Frida Kahlo, Mexican flamboyant and surrealist painter, and Diego Rivera, her brilliant womanizing husband. Salma Hayek is perfectly cast in this sumptuous film that chronicles her own revolutionary behavior, not just politically but also sexually, especially given the era in which she lived. Beautiful cinematography renders a crippling trolley accident vividly real on the screen, while turning a trip to NY into a cartoon-ish sequence. Wonderful.

Beautiful cinematography renders a crippling trolley accident vividly real on the screen, while turning a trip to NY into a cartoon-ish sequence. Wonderful. Tragedy mars the background of nearly every character in Shipping News, a very good but not perfect video made from Annie Proulx's book of the same name. The widowed Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) and his daughter head off with Aunt Agnes (the inimitable Dame Judi Dench) to the old abandoned family homestead on a heartlessly barren piece of rock on Newfoundland's coast, hoping to begin their lives anew. A contemporary case of time travel lands the Duke Leopold of Albany (1870-era chivalrous dude) in Manhattan, 2001. He falls in love with Kate, and then the whole time issue becomes the question of, if this affair is to endure, which of them will make the switch, because it's clear that, well, to tell more would be to tell too much. A little hokey, a little silly, but it's fun enough for an evening at home. Beautiful, evocative, slow (in a good way), and ever so memorable video. It's about a Midwestern farm family  of a dour old man and his two sons. A tragic even in their past has left each of them wounded in different ways. When the bank sends an unexpected foreclosure notice, a mystery comes to light that irrevocably changes them and their relationships to each other and their community. Funny, sad, thoughtful...and wonderful. This wonderful and beautifully acted film concerns Pai, a girl being raised by her grandparents in a patriarchal New Zealand tribe. She believes she is destined to become the tribe's new chief - and nearly loses her life (riding a whale out to sea) to prove her point. The movie deals with tension between genders, generations, the new and the old, the spiritual and the real, animals and people. Spectacular.

A17N79D5PI5BMN," I think this movie is great to watch if you're a fan of 80's movies. There was cheesy hair, cheesy clothes, and totally rad slang. Plus you can't go wrong with Feldman & Haim. Well  you can but this movie was pretty well played. I like it as much as a person can without loving a moving. It's just the right amount of funny vs girlie vs 90's all smacked in your face with a bit of dumb too. If you loved the 90's and / or loved this movie, it is worth buying. In this movie, you can really see Reese's acting skills come to life. Who knew she was able to be white trash? Love when she points out Bob's poop bag lol I myself do not like dry humor so I didn't really get this show. But my husband grew up with this show and said this box set was a treat. So if you love Bob Newhart's humor and you love older shows, you'll love this box set. I just love the dynamics in this season. Such rich passion for life and really portrays the city life for a woman in that time as you would envision it to have been. Bob Newhart has a very dry sense of humor and I don't personally get it. None of the characters really captivate me but this would be a good watch for someone with a dry sense of humor. The only thing that troubles me about this documentary is why no one ever figured out who did it. But overall, this documentary was interesting and had a lot of facts I had not heard or seen before. This DVD was entertaining but I thought it would explain the creepy things that happened on the scenes of these movies. Instead, this documentary of sorts gives explanation as to how these movie concepts came to light. In this season, there were several turns of events that kept you guessing. This season is a perfect example of why I love this show  for its humor, its suspense, and the element of change and surprise. Allison Dubois is definitely a character to be reckoned with. This show is for anyone who loves the mystery behind the things we cannot explain. All we have are accounts of these wonders. Sometimes the most compelling story cannot be backed up - only told. I feel like that's what this show embodies. Sometimes all you have are words of an incredible event. This show acts out those stories and makes them real again. Another well played season of Medium. You cannot watch this season and expect all of the same things to happen over and over again. You will be surprised at all of the twists and turns in Allisons life and of the lives of those around her. Be prepared to be taken aback by the happenings in our favorite mediums life. The investigators in these episodes tend to seek out ghosts rather than to try to prove or disprove anything. I really don't like that technique. You should always try to make the evidence as credible as possible and not base evidence on ""feelings"" or popular belief. I wasn't expecting much due to Michael Scott being gone, but the cast really did a great job at filling in that missing piece. I really enjoyed this season except for the annoying British woman. Apparently I don't get her humor because she just isn't funny to me. But everyone else on the show was great! I am very dissapointed not at the seller but at whomever made this movie. It really sucked. The footage says real footage but it wasn't! It was all actors! And the house was completely different from the true Amityville house. SUCKS! I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end! It had great actors, great effects, great props. Altogether one of the best horror movies I've ever watched! And best yet is this is a true story! I loved this season of A Haunting. It may be my favorite. I like the new opening and the sequence between each story line. Very impressed when I thought I wouldn't be. Highly Recommended! This movie is bizarre. But if you're a big Elijah Wood fan you may like it. I don't want to type a spoiler so I will just say if you're at all interested, watch it and decide for yourself if you like it based on the movie description. Until the very end, this season did not dissapoint. I really dislike the fact that this show had to end but I guess it had nowhere else to go so I can understand. This is a great compilation of some of the best of Beavis & Butthead. The only thing I wish, and I've seen this comment on some of the Mike Judge compilations is that there needs to be music video commentary from the guys.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AC9RN6DJ953QY," This movie is original, unforgettable, and intense. It is about a white guy being mocked, targeted, and treated like an outcast mainly because of his skin color. Surprisingly, he was discriminated by people of his own race. I guess this movie probably inspires minorities especially black people. This movie is original, unforgettable, and intense. It is about a white guy being mocked, targeted, and treated like an outcast mainly because of his skin color. Surprisingly, he was discriminated by people of his own race. I guess this movie probably inspires minorities especially black people. Just by looking at the front cover, I can see Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon pretending to be Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan on the Rush Hour movie series. However, I have not seen this movie for years. I am so glad that I ordered the DVD. I love the part especially with model Gisele Bundchen touching that other woman (Jennifer Esposito) inappropriately. I saw this movie. It was not that great. But, the main and only reason I bought it is because of Barbara Eden (Jeannie, ""I Dream of Jeannie""). If you are a fan of hers, then you would probably be willing to watch any movie or television show she played/plays. Janet Jackson is so sexy. I cannot stop staring at the front cover of the DVD. I also loved the back cover and everything else that comes with the item. I love the concert. I cannot wait to see this again.  If you are fanatic, attracted, or curious about Janet Jackson, please purchase this DVD. This movie is memorable to me. I love that Al Pacino's character created a computerized woman for a good purpose. Everyone in the world falls in love with this nonexistent woman because of her purity and innocence. But, nobody never finds the truth except for Al Pacino's character's family at the end.  I recommend the movie to anyone who likes to create or enjoys watching a movie like ""Weird Science"". Two of the best Christmas movies are included in this DVD set. I, as well as my family, love watching Home Alone 1 and Home Alone 2. Macaulay Culkin did great playing the role of Kevin when he was young. Despite of his current problems/status, he could make a comeback playing grown Kevin (same role) for an upcoming ""Home Alone"" movie or something similar.  No more ""Home Alone"" sequels... The movie was interesting but not really what I expected.  It is about a serious cop (Samuel L. Jackson) looking for a particular suspect but ending up being kidnapped and threatened. He had his moments with a woman (Milla Jovovich) who is part of a theft gang. Other things occurred. The movie was honestly like an adventure. The only reason I wanted to see this movie is because of the ""swirl"" relationship between the characters of actors Samuel L. Jackson and Milla Jovovich. His character helped an old couple only that he was held captive by some guys they knew. Her character had a criminal boyfriend and so. But, I really loved the interracial connection the most. I was glad to see Kathryn Morris (Lilly Rush on ""Cold Case""), LL Cool J, and Val Kilmer playing in this movie together. The movie was great to see. I did not know who was the main suspect. But, like me, whoever watches the movie would not find out until about 10 minutes before the movie ending. It is confusing to learn that Season 3 of my favorite classic series ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is coming out on DVD except for the previous 2 seasons. I also wonder what volume DVDs cover the entire third season of this DVD. I would look out for this anyway. I love this show so much that I can watch it all day. I love how Jeannie came into contact with her master Tony and got a taste of the real world. She realized that life is not always a fairy tale when it comes to pursuing a relationship with someone. Roselyn Sanchez stars in her sexiest movie ever. Her character has a similar background as she did in real life. She emigrates to New York from Puerto Rico in order to reach her goal: dancing. Throughout the movie, she goes through certain issues, doubt, persistence, and of course a decision between choosing her dream goal or following her new boyfriend (D.B. Sweeney) who is an international doctor to Australia. I love this movie. I have not seen it for a long time. I am glad that sexy Maria Menounos who is now on ""Extra"" with Mario Lopez played in it. However, that is the only movie she acted. I love the front DVD cover with Jamie Kennedy, his pals, and the babe (Maria Menounos) wearing nice coat and shorts plus showing nice legs. I  do like that my favorite actors Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Justin Timberlake, and others are in it. However, I found the movie kind of confusing, corny, and irritating. I could not wait for it to end. I  do like that my favorite actors Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Justin Timberlake, and others are in it. However, I found the movie kind of confusing, corny, and irritating. I could not wait for it to end. This is an excellent collection DVD to buy and to keep. Some of the movies are good to watch such as Cave Girl, Coach, My Tutor, and Weekend Pass. The other movies like Tomboy and Jocks I was not that crazy from watching. I will give them an average C. This movie was good and meaningful. Hilary Duff played a dynamic role as rebellious, outspoken, and rude Greta. She hated her mother, her boyfriend, and pretty much everyone else. But, she realized that life is not all about her as she stayed with her maternal grandparents temporarily, found a job, met a former criminal boyfriend, attempted suicide, and so on. Michael Jackson sure was right. I love that Sandra Bullock's character pretty much adopted a big black guy (Quinton Aaron) into her family. Of course, they had to deal with those who discriminate or focus much on skin color but they overcame that regardless. The black guy ended up becoming a NFL athlete and therefore has a change of life forever. This movie is worthwhile. It is never boring, entertaining, sexy, and comedic. I loved  every scene of the movie. I would love to see more interracial movies indeed. Unlike most movies, this one is original. This movie was about two rich, attractive sisters going through a complete change in life because of their dad's fortune loss. They were forced to live with their aunt and therefore exposed to her world of poverty, drugs, gangsters, etc. Despite of that, they found happiness and stability... This movie was interesting. It included and probably was made for the next generation of young teens and adults. I was glad to see sexy Hayden Panettiere and Julia Roberts's niece Emma who turned out to be the main suspect for the entire killings. I would probably say this movie was the second best after Scream 2. One Tyler Perry movie I was glad to see for the first time. It was interesting and unique. But, it was also a little strange as well. Gabrielle Union's character did not get so jealous. Instead, she was understanding when Tyler Perry's character decided not to marry her near the ending of the movie. His character went the right path finally. It was an unique movie.  Jennifer Lopez played a character who was curious and obviously interested in Parker (Jason Statham). But, he already had a girlfriend he was in love and who brought the best side of him. Anyways, he employed Jennifer Lopez's character to do something for him. In return, she received something she definitely wanted/needed - money. She had the chance to move out of her mother's place. Seth MacFarlane is a hilarious comedian. I love ""Family Guy"" and I feel the same way about the movie ""Ted"" (shortened name for a existent teddy bear). I like the scene in which Ted had...with his girlfriend. He also had to deal with a psychotic and kidnapping father and son wanting to control and abuse him. Overall, the movie is worth seeing. I would not mind viewing an encore. I have wanted to see this movie because of the storyline and the favorable actors such as Stacey Dash (""Clueless""), Persia White (""Girlfriends""), Megan Good, Stacy Keibler (George Clooney's current girlfriend), Tatyana Ali, and others. It is dramatic but nice to see a bunch of friends reconnecting because of their attendance to a late friend's funeral and reception of money from the man's free will. I would like to see this movie again maybe on DVD. I am surprised of Tyler Perry playing in this movie as an action star or so. I also think that he did not write and produce this movie either. I am kind of glad. He probably wanted viewers to see and treat him differently than they usually do regarding his movies and his character ""Madea"". It is painful to see and know that innocent and defenseless girls and other victims being sold and forced into prostitution globally. Human trafficking indeed remains increased even though victims are rescued from time to time. This movie is highly recommendable for viewers who need to know the ugly truth about human trafficking. It is surprising to see actress and activist Mira Sorvino playing in another movie about child slavery and prostitution. I think that this was the first time Kristen Bell and Dax Shepherd, married couple, played together in a movie before they did her movie ""Veronica Mars"". I like that Joy Bryant, his co-star from the NBC show ""Parenthood"", was in it but as his character Yul's former girlfriend and criminal. Bradley Cooper's character was cool but at least he was not pretending to be black or from the hood. This movie was inspirational. It was about two women (Viola Davis, Maggie Gyllenhaal) who fight for justice in the public school system so that their kids and others can be taught fairly and respectfully. Of course, like everyone else, they went through obstacles. However, they overcame them and accomplished their goals.  No matter what happens and what people do to you, always follow your heart and do the right thing. This movie was not that great. But, I bought it for the same reason (which is a beautiful woman) I bought also ""Serial Buddies"" featuring Maria Menounos. Cameron Diaz was the villain of ""The Counselor"". But, she made the movie much better. Her character's appearance, personality, and scenes (one communicating and touching Penelope Cruz and the other doing it with her boyfriend's car) made this crappy movie worth watching. Another great and emotional movie Tyler Perry created.  It was about a 20-something woman (Jurnee Smollett) who was happily married at first but became bored with her marriage and job eventually. She met this rich, charismatic man who ""fell in love"" and gave her what she wanted. However, there were negative consequences for the actions/decisions she made.  This is a good movie for younger and older viewers alike. I am surprised of Tyler Perry playing in this movie as an action star or so. I also think that he did not write and produce this movie either. I am kind of glad. He probably wanted viewers to see and treat him differently than they usually do regarding his movies and his character ""Madea"". Of course, my opinion of the movie changed after watching it.  But, I still liked the movie anyway. It was about an Italian family relocating to a new city and changing its identities because of witness protection. Father, mother, daughter, and son each went through their own struggles. But, they became closer after fighting and killing their enemies. The movie did not make sense.  It really had nothing to do with the Tekken video game series at all.  How could Kazuya turned from a really bad, despicable guy in the previous Tekken live action movie to a hero in this movie sequel? This movie turned out very well. I was glad to see a white couple adopting and falling in love with a Haitian girl. They risked their lives just to save that girl.  This movie is worth seeing. This was a good movie.  It was about a woman (Sharon Leal) who had a good life, good marriage, good family, and good business. All of that came tumbling down when she became sexually involved with a successful artist (William Levy). She increased a high sex drive and found another lover (Tyson Beckford) at a nightclub. As time passed by, she went through an emotional rollercaster and so on. I like the front cover more than I do with the movie.  It was a little scary and disturbing to see some people killed.  But, I was bored from watching it. Maybe if there was someone (e.g. Eva Mendes, Sofia Vergara, or Eva Longoria) I knew was in the movie, I probably would had enjoyed it more. The front cover of this movie is a misconception like the one for Danny Trejo's movie ""Pastor Shepherd"". Michelle Pfeiffer was not the main star of ""Callie & Son"". Her character was secretly killed by her mother-in-law in the woods. The movie was overall good even though the only person I recognized was Michelle Pfeiffer. The movie was okay. I ended up giving it away to a buyer recently.  I was a little confused about the movie.  But, I liked that Melissa Joan Hart and Carmen Elektra, whom I am a fan of both, were in it together. I bought this DVD mainly because of the late Gary Coleman and the time he met his wife. I tried seeing it from the beginning but something may be wrong with the disc. I am not sure but I would keep trying to play it. I bought this movie because of my two favorite female celebrities (Pamela Anderson, Denise Richards). The movie may be silly and so. But, I like that both women are in it. It would probably had been great if Jenny McCarthy was in the movie too. This was a great movie. It was about a teenage boy who wanted revenge against a famous fighter who responsibly killed his parents years earlier.  You would see the change/maturity of the boy throughout the entire movie.  It is worth watching. At first, no one really took him seriously. But, he persisted and became an extraordinary human being who inspires and blesses others. The movie was good, clever, and worthwhile.  I like that Julie Benz's character showed persistence in order to clear her name, disguised as someone else, and let everyone find out the truth regarding her son Timmy's ""death"".  This movie should be on Lifetime...or if it was on that channel, then that is great.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A29R3O02O0PON4," If you're wanting to purchase the SPEED films, wait till July 30th and get the new FIVE STAR COLLECTION versions of these films.

According to the Digital Bits thru their FOX resource contacts have confirmed that this new version of ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" will be the 92-minute extended TV version, as opposed to the 86-minute version that's only been available here in the States.  Apparently, the extended cut has been available in Japan for some time, but not here.

Well, I enjoyed the original version of this Sci-Fi produced version of this Frank Herbert classic.  But now with this one, we're going to have an additional 30 minutes of additional footage.  Man, I can't imagine what this will contain.  Hopefully some fleshed out battle scenes or somefink... According to TheDigitalBits' March 2nd report, on April 4th, 2006, (the week after the movie is released on DVD), the price on the Production Diaries will drop from SRP of $39.98 to just $22.98, which should get you the set for around $18, I'd say.  This is probably due to the fact that the extras on the 2-disc set of the movie contains the production diaries AFTER the ones on this set which cover pre-production stuff. Just a heads up, the Pathfinder DVD has a intro preview of Day Watch and it says it's coming to DVD soon, so for those who might think of buying a R5 import, just hold off a little while.  I rate this review as 5 stars because the trailer on the Pathfinder DVD looked awesome.  Much better than Night Watch. DeepDiscount is shipping this already. Got mine today, Monday, April 23rd and of course it was shipped sometime the week prior.  Haven't watched any of it yet, but will tonight after work. So I'm looking at my ""Open and Recently Shipped Orders"" and I wonder why the price on this item is still so high.  So I come here and see the new pic for it.  Looks like another Steelbook, just like the one from the first movie's 2-disc edition.  Which is good because it'll fit next to the original quite nicely.

Universal is repackaging the series to include the telefilm ""The Plan"" and in all new slim packaging.  The only thing known at this point is that the discs will be in ""slim packaging"" surrounded by an outer slip box cover.  I'm guessing they'll be four 6-disc blu-ray cases (similar to the Sarah Connor Chronicles) in an outer box.  EDIT:  Apparently the packaging will be a series of digipaks, one for each season inside of the outer box. This current listing for Hawaii Five-O is for a B&M store exclusive.  The series is getting an official wide-retail release on Feb. 7th, 2012.  And I'm betting the price will be a bit cheaper.  So just wait a bit longer and get the official BD release. A little more information about this release....  Bad Boys (1995) has been remastered in 4K for this new Blu-ray release.  Bad Boys II is coming to Blu-ray for the first time and is ALSO remastered in 4K.

A3TZLMZVP5H5J4," I and my 10 year old daughter laught till we are blue in the face. The ""Last Word"" skit is priceless and it takes someone like Leslie Nielsen to play off Mel Brooks in this kind of movie. The music, the costuming and the sets are a wonderfull nod to the good old days of Universals Dracula. If you liked Belas Dracula, then this movie will feel like an old friend come by again to share a laugh. Love the movie but hate hearing that NOW we get a better blur ray with proper ratio. If its cleaner and ratio correct we should be able to send back their crappy earlier release in exchange. Lousy SOBS While the original, interesting only because it was the original, actually did not have the whimsy the Marky W. remake had and the ending of the original was stupid, and attempt at irony that failed badly and a real downer. Michael Caine, great, magnificent gentleman actor that you have always been, why did you do this movie. Apparently Im not the only one with sound issues. On my dvd I could play it no problem. On the TV you could hear all the ambient sounds, telephones, doors slamming, but no dialog. Which I know had a major effect on tuning out and turning off the series for many of us out there. This is a chance for us to get thru the central theme of a cabal of aliens and human conspirators without timeouts for weird creatures or the like.  This is not to say  a lot of them were not good stories or creepy. But for many of us the sizzle was in the conspiracy and not the inbetweens. Why they could have subtitles on the DVD and not on the Bluray  is really annoying. The picture itself is nice and clean, the story is great popcorn and coke,  but the habit of companies to transfer movies and then omit the subtitles, just because the may have added an interview or such as they do here is ridiculous. Kino Lorber whose transfers are usually excellent  seem to be most complicit in the area of subtitle omission. The story of the Pashtan of Afghanistan, of the Beta Israel, the Lemba, the KaiFong  Jews of China are reasearch done long ago by others with better credentials then him.   When will people recognize that his job is to put the cameras in, read a script and file it with his company and collect his money.  He is the Jewish Ron Wyatt. And some supposed story about something that looks like the queen creature from ""The Faculty"" and deadly, must be, sea-spiders who always of course come ashore whenever the sound of havoc reaches them in the depths below. I always liked the extended versions and felt I was getting a more complete film experience. How can Jackson think to cut out Sarumans fate for example. And many other scenes that answered questions that I had that the extended editions filled in. But Im curious as too why the price is now $167.00 US dollars when I bought it in 2007 for $66.00 thats a mark up I would expect from the private seller crowd not Amazon. Vampires are back. No says Vampire Killing Council. Yes says Young Priest. No says council head and don't mention it ever again. Young Priest heads out to save neice or whoever she was. Vampire killing council sends killers to kill young priest. Vampires that are not back kill Vampire killer council flunkies. Young Priest kills boss Vampire. People trampled in mad rush to leave scene of tasteless, talentless movie. Tom Cruise played the character very low key. Its as though he was a supporting actor rather then the headlining star. His character is almost like the one in Mission Impossible, but without the stress. He takes each incident or confrontation on their own merits and moves at his own pace to solve the problems of the victim/s without fancy gimmicks, just brain power. Hope their is another one. A great film that follow the revenge theme of Dr Phibes in many ways, only this time Uncle Vincent is a Shakespearean actor who lost a coveted award to a relative newcomer. So he avenges himself on the voting committee that he feels wronged him in their denial of the award by doing away with them ala the crimes in the plays that each review had over year criticized in the papers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1C0A4R8M2XKAX," i'll be brief this film is an absolute rollercoaster. people who like SPEED and Gone in 60 seconds should see this movie. I really don't think much of plots but i thought this one was good. You'll enjoy the visual and special effects. rent this movie instead of pearl harbor. pearl harbor starring Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett is terribley made. Get this version of the Dec. 7 attack and quick. This one actually manages to devote the whole movie to peral harbor and they do it spectacularly. The attack is well-done and superbly choreographed it should be ranked up there with other great war movies like Gettysburg,Midway, and even the longest day. this film was very well-done. It clearly shows true historical events. I saw this movie in Global Studies and fell in love with it. It shows how not Britain like very other European nation at this time the new imperialism which took place. Strongly recommended for Global studies teachers teaching the new imperialism topics in ther class. All in all very enticing war movie. after seeing films like Full Metal Jacket this looks out of date. But when you listen to it no film comes closer to properly outlining the events of a good battle. With actors like Richard Burton, Paul Anka, Robert Mitchum, and John Wayne this movie was the best of it's day. Today it's got challenges from Saving Private Ryan, Full Meatl Jacket and Apocalypse Now but to me its still the greatest war movie of all time. the plot for this movie considering what it was might have faltered but Cage and Travolta's performance work nicely to fit the sequences. John Woo at his best in this film. Plenty of bullets fly! I enjoy every moment of this show of the scifi channel. I think it's hilarious. It's quite enjoyable and entertaining. My favorite character on the show is Tom Servo. I like the movie it's totally a laughriot. I enjoy every minute of MST3K i just wish they were still making new episodes today. this movie was absolutely good. it was a little to short but nevertheless exciting with the best storyline of the series probably. You need this dvd now especially if your into dinosaurs. The dinosaurs were superb for this film and quite possibly the best of the series when it comes to cgi effects. You need this dvd seriously. I hope you all enjoy the brand new dinosaur they have loaded for this film. the mummy ultimate edition dvd is one of the best films i have on dvd. the mummy is truly spectacular. with huge special effects good actors and acting the mummy never runs out of adrenaline. brendan fraser and rachel weisz are superb as Rick O'Connell and Evelyn the librarian are perfectly fit. one of the best films of the 1990's. the mummy packs a wallop! the mummy ultimate edition dvd is one of the best films i have on dvd. the mummy is truly spectacular. with huge special effects good actors and acting the mummy never runs out of adrenaline. brendan fraser and rachel weisz are superb as Rick O'Connell and Evelyn the librarian are perfectly fit. one of the best films of the 1990's. the mummy packs a wallop! the mummy ultimate edition dvd is one of the best films i have on dvd. the mummy is truly spectacular. with huge special effects good actors and acting the mummy never runs out of adrenaline. brendan fraser and rachel weisz are superb as Rick O'Connell and Evelyn the librarian are perfectly fit. one of the best films of the 1990's. the mummy packs a wallop!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ," ... to be an American! (No matter where you're from.) Terrorists hijack Air Force One. Harrison Ford is President. Take it from there. A well-paced thriller, with characters - good and bad - having more than one dimension. Moments of ruthless cruelty - and moments of extraordinary courage and valor. A clever and funny romp about a detective who's suffering short-term memory loss. Carvey plays it well, and so does the dog. The premise has him trying to make sense of the urgent goings-on around him, and is used to great effect. Don't want to ruin the plot, so just go watch it!  Don't be discouraged by the three stars. I think I gave Saving Private Ryan four. The plot is ludicrous. Almost every part of it is unrealistic. The dialogue is ludicrous. The acting is ludicrous. There are only two or three good fight scenes.  The director has no feel for what people would normally do in the situations the characters find themselves in.  It's awful. Slow? Yes, but it works. Bruce Willis is led to discover and accept something strange about himself ... you will want to cheer him when he puts it to work. Also works out his father-son relationship in some very touching scenes. Big shocker at the end. Eddie Murphy is hilarious in this movie. The animation is a little wooden compared to some later movies, but it's still a fun ride. There. Now, stop bothering me to write a review. Brad Pitt is great at those little comedic gestures of frustration; there are funny moments throughout, although you may feel that this movie is overlong. There's the token gay couple (one tough and violent, both likeable, but you knew that), many variants of the history of an old gun everyone's after, traffic lights in the middle of nowhere, endearing characters, some memorable scenes. Worth at least one watch. Grabs your attention at the start, but then it tapers off and plods. Some cute scenes, mostly regarding the idea of these centenarians getting ready to be shot into space. The finale is muddled, bland, and finally predictable. Somewhat entertaining. Is it funny or charming? Well, this film panders to anti-Americanism, the new religion of the world. American girls are portrayed as loose bimbos; the Prime Minister is given kudos for stickin' it to the nasty American President. The plot is shallow and so are the characters. Don't say you weren't warned.  Those who absolutely loved this film are encouraged to mindlessly click on Not Helpful :) The main draw of the movie, the action, is not very satisfying ... lots of shooting and running, not enough Jet vs. Jason. But there is a HUGE and devious plot twist which almost makes this movie worth watching. Very funny. Depardieu and Richard play well off each other in this comedy where they are sent on a mission to retrieve the mishap-ridden daughter of a businessman. Their acting is comedy gold, especially the scene where Richard attacks Depardieu. I remember seeing the US version with Martin Short and Danny Glover, but I don't recall the title of the movie. But this was lots of fun. Slow, unoriginal, meaningless. Don't believe James Cameron's endorsement on the cover. The visuals - I expected much more. The action scenes are uninspired. It feels like a plodding anime - guess why. And the ending - feh. The battles are so one-sided, you start rooting for the vampires. I mean, one touch of Blade's silver weapons and they're dead. Wow, really exciting, huh.  And their casting of Dracula was completely wrong. I mean terribly wrong.  Also, Blade and Whistler seem to be killing or severely injuring humans in this movie - blasting them with shotguns, blowing them up, etc. I found that reprehensible. What's the point of vampire hunting if not to protect humans? I expected a mindless shoot-em-up, but there are actually likeable characters we can empathize with, a servicable plot, and some clever twists, especially at the end. There's blood and violence galore, and shooting of innocent bystanders. Ving Rhames plays himself, as usual. As the title of this review says: it's a boring, plodding, and ultimately unsatisfying scoop of ... well, you get the idea. The ending is totally blah. Like the rest of it. Wonderfully filmed and awe-inspiring, but marred by unscientific nutcake alarmism (""the icecaps are melting! it's our fault! aaargh! the penguins are dying! Aaargh!"") - search for junkscience or see Inhofe's site for the scientific rejection of this religious ranting. Also, necessarily vague Darwinist pablum is randomly tossed in. If you can ignore this religious material and focus on the real science, you're in for a treat. Well written, witty, funny, thought-provoking, surprising, populated with endearing yet believable (well, maybe) characters, and consistently engaging, this show is a real find!  The quicksilver FX is terrible, but you'll easily forgive this while being caught up in the adventures of the smart, lanky ex-thief hero, his parking-validation-seeking underpaid sidekick, his penny-pinching teddy bear boss, and of course his strangely exotic, attractive keeper. Each show has well-drawn personalities and is immensely entertaining. This is a great presentation for anyone with any interest in astronomy and our universe. It's a video of a gospel presentation interspersed with amazing photos of galaxies and so forth. Unfortunately the event itself does not appear to be in HD, but the pictures are, and they are awe-inspiring reminders of who God really is - and how much he has done for us through his Son. A good remedy for the trivialization of the word ""awesome"". Wow, with these two big stars, how could it go wrong? Yet it does.  This movie is utter rubbish. The plot gives you only two options, and when it's finally resolved, it's feels silly.  The middle part, though, is only tedious. So it's not all bad! Harvey starts following some Brit woman around. I guess the movie's supposed to be kind of sweet, but if you think about it, it's actually kind of creepy. It's one of those movie plots where, if you did this in real life, you'd get arrested or beaten with a tire iron.  It's also uneven. When you get to the end, it feels like one-third of the plot is missing.  Creepy!

When you get to the end, it feels like one-third of the plot is missing.  Creepy! No one could fault the production values. But this movie is confusing as hell. Character decisions, conversations and plot points appear incoherently, without enough explanation or exposition or motivation. It's often hard to tell where things are happening, where people are, why they're there, who they're talking about ... All a disjointed mess. Jet Li does a good job playing a confusing character, though. First, the summary on the back of the case is inaccurate. Second, there are a couple of squeamish bits. One is quite graphic - involving the uh, taking of a thumb; the other, also involving body parts, is quite shocking, but is later ... er ... mitigated.  Rickman is wonderful as a self-important, philandering professor. The plot is wonderfully puzzling, and, for all its twistedness, not lacking in humanity or heart.  And that's all I can say about that. I think the title of my review says it all.  It's hilarious. The script is great. It's like Ocean's Eleven in stop motion.  The little touches are great - how they eat (like wild animals), Mrs. Fox's huge paintings actually tiny in human hands, etc. etc. Genius.  Slighly gory, the shot-off tail. But otherwise kid-friendly. A low-budget scary movie that's low on gore but high on chills. Well, yeah, there *are* deaths, but nothing too graphic.  There's a major plot twist you may see coming, and it's a doozy. It's a fun enough scary movie. 3.5 stars. I don't get the point of complaining about the sets or the train. Should only high-budget pics get good ratings?  This film is entertaining enough. The plot is intriguing, and the characters are believable. There is some semi-graphic violence, such as someone getting shot in the eye (the aftermath, not the actual event) and someone getting cut into pieces, but not as bad as some recent movies - perhaps about the level of an episode of ""Bones."" It's not big-budget effects, but the minimal use of them and the maximum use of tension and suspense that makes this work.  As the husband, Micah, continually taunts and challenges the entity, your dread level is ratcheted up and up until the next scare sequence. Every bang and bump is invested with terror.  If you like to be really scared, this may do the trick. If not, avoid this movie! What do you expect going into this movie? It was entertaining, a little silly, with likeable characters and stunning scenery. If you like that description, you'll enjoy it. Note that there's some rather adult subject matter, though, so it's not for kids. There's no reason whatsoever to watch this, even for free (which I did). It brings nothing to the table. The villain turns out to be really weak, too, almost pathetic in their ""climactic"" battle. A complete waste of time. Tries too hard to be the next When Harry Met Sally with its quick-fire dialogue, which pales in comparison. Hard to like either of them until much later in the movie when they become more like human beings rather than dialogue robots. Her eyes are too big and catlike - looks unnatural. You should know already that this is not a family movie, but just in case ... It's not.  Moderately entertaining. Sometimes ok action punctuates long stretches of tedious dialogue. The climatic chase, motorbikes in Manila, is underwhelming - the &uuml;ber-assassin opponent is not too impressive. Thankfully the action is not ruined by the stupid-shaky-cam of the previous Bournes. A harrowing workplace shooting - the helpless, unarmed victims all menaced by a single gunman - makes a good case for ubiquitous arms in the office. This was ok for a rental, but it's really not worth a second watch, and they knew it. For the longest time, this and Zero Dark Thirty could not be resold here.

After that, it was surprisingly tedious and boring, not terribly funny. The two or three baddies after her didn't amount to much of anything.  Disappointing. It's ok, but after half a dozen (or less) the stories all seem the same. The problem is the lack of an overarching story to keep you hooked, such as in The Blacklist and other series. For a low budget movie, this one is entertaining enough for fans (and soon-to-be fans) of parkour. The leads do a credible job, and the script is decent. The only weakness is the how they take on armed mobsters (and Eric Roberts' poor security arrangements) but worth a watch.

You should know already that this is not a family movie, but just in case ... It's not.  Moderately entertaining. Terrible plot and script.  At least an hour of total boredom before much of anything happens. One or two short action sequences. Jerky camera work. A poor update of E.T. for our times.

A1B350OHYHQTGX," Harrison Ford does a great job in this film. He's so convincing in both emotion and action wise as in his great old movie Indiana Jones! Although we have seen so many films about airplane accidents and hijacking but this one is a Master Piece of all. the suspense is very original and the action is very entertaining... of course you see that US politics plays a major role in HollyWood! I truly liked the story and the acting was nice as well. But one hour of watching the movie, things started going faster than it should that killed the suspense and the ending became very predicatable and unsatisfying for the viewers! The story of this movie is not much at all... actually it is weak and I knew this even before I buy this DVD. But what made it worth buying is to see Demi Moore strip for you... that's it! So if you are a fan of Demi Moore and want to see her strip for you... go for it. If not, don't even consider buying it! The story is so nice, Kevin Costner as so good and the movie as a whole is worth watching but... What I did not like about this movie is the actress Robin Wright, I wish Julia Roberts played this role instead of Robin. Robin acting, looks nor expressions are suitable for this film! Plus the movie gets a little bit boaring in the middle... But still it is a good movie... I LOVED THE STORY! This movie had all the elements of success: nice story, great drive chase, good acting and elite actors... but still all together doesn't fit. I still can't figure out why. But maybe (I said maybe) this type of movie belongs to a younger generation of actors... I know it's a good movie but there's something that affected it that I couldn't figure out what it is. Oh yes, this story to many older generation is the starting point and the beginning of love stories drama. The story of this movie is very touching but for now a days the acting is not all that. I recommend reading the book. But still it is ""the"" classic love movie of all time..! A film written, produced, directed and acted by Mel Brooks is his Master Piece! This film remains continuously funny and entertaining for 20 years so far except for the Spanish Inquistion which was boring and embedded with historical myths! But if you take it as it is, you won't stop laughing and will enjoy it as a Classic Commedy. This movie is so great... so powerful and with high suspense. Kevin Spacey is a great actor as always. And I say all actors and the director did a great job especially with the amazing score. This movie reminds me of ""Primal Fear"". I'd recommend you watch both movies because they're both so powerful and with a surprisingly extreme twist at the end. If you can accept the exaggeration of the story, both John Travolta, Nicolas Cage did a great job. Plus the actions in this movie are very rich and breath taking. But when combining both the exaggerated story with the super action scenes it will conclude into an unrealistic film. To enjoy this film is to take it as is with no analysis or plot! This is the ULTIMATE GAME of no MERCY!!! There can be nothing like it and can be no game!!! Such game can be extremely dangerous, stressful breath taking and a KILLER! All through the movie you feel for Michael Douglas and what he's going through. You keep jumping to conclusions, if it's a game or not. At the end of the film you'll know the truth... As Michael Douglas, you can experience the game only once... Some people might get confused between some Muslims of our days who give their religion a bad name and the true reality of Islam. For those who want to know how did Islam start on this earth, what is it about and it's moralities... this would give you the right picture. Very well done movie, very well done acting... ...and ""the"" very honest M E S S A G E ! The story could be not all that, although it is still an interesting story. But what I liked the most of this movie is the BRILLIANT speech of the characters... oh both Anthony Hopkins & Cuba Gooding Jr. were so good. I see this film very similar to the movie ""Entrapment"" but in a One-Man-Show for Pierce Brosnan. Also this film reminds me of a TV successful Best Seller ""If tomorrow comes"". This film combines Pierce Brosnan charm & intelligince with the power and adventures of being a spoiled rich man who simply has everything! I would have rated this film 5 stars but because of Rene Russo I gave it 5 Stars! Oh yes the movie is nice but it can never be compared to his Tomorrow Never Dies!!! The sound track as always in amazing, the acting is well done, is the story is challenging as always but the action is not as good Tomorrow Never Dies! But if you are 007 fan, you've got to buy/rent this DVD no matter what... The critics said that Titus is the worst play of Shakespeare, although I may not fully agree... but difinitly this movie is the worst of Anthony Hopkins. The movie should have not been placed in the current century, this has killed the movie and made it senseless! I loved the music of this film, loved the settings and acting but all together with Shakespeare language did not make any sense. Not in words I can ever describe how GREAT this movie is. GREAT sound track, GREAT picture, GREAT actors, GREAT effects, GREAT story... and a GREAT job done. I cannot see how would there ever be a better movie in this 21 century. This DVD is a MUST for every library. This movies contains great marshal arts, the story was interesting and the ending was impressive. This movie is worth seeing if you can accept the fiction of a super hero who can defeat everybody! I can never believe such a successful actor could fail this way! This movie could be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in the Cinema history... it has a meaningless story, bad acting, and is so stupid! If you want to say a star fall so bad, watch this movie... but do not ever consider buying it, or you'll be sorry! The songs are brilliant, the Sound & Picture are great! What I liked the most was the teaser at the beginning and the ending Treasure Chest!!! You cannot take this as the only MJ greatest songs, there are so many great ones that are not included on this DVD... plus this DVD has no extras at all. But no matter what better have it and hope that other DVDs of his are to come. The collection has the best of Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton & Roger Moore... they are classics now but a must have for 007 fans! One of the Best Roger Moore's 007 movie Octopussy and A View To A Kill as well... If you love Sean Connery's classics or Roger Moore's best or Timothy Dalton's The Living Daylights... this is what you need! This movie is waste of time! The story is extremely silly! Yes, there is action, sexy girls... but that's all. The plot is silly, events are weak and dialogue is terrible. Some said, ""if you liked Mission Impossible you'd like this movie""! This is an insult. MI is great movie but this one is silly! This movie is so great... so powerful and with high suspense. Kevin Spacey is a great actor as always. And I say all actors and the director did a great job especially with the amazing score. This movie reminds me of ""Primal Fear"". I'd recommend you watch both movies because they're both so powerful and with a surprisingly extreme twist at the end. This is not a movie... it is as well said a ""Screen Saver""! It is so relaxing, entertaining and amazing! It shows you the paths of the world, sounds and scenes... how it all floats in a rythm. It is worth watching and buying... I hope there are many DVD's of this type. This DVD is fine but not all that... you can not take it as a documentary about political, strategical or historical events. Instead you take it as power show-off. If you are after arms, planes, fighters and strategic weapons used in the war... this DVD covers most of it. But if you want fully covered details about behind the scenes policies and in depth covered histroy, this DVD is not all that. Oh yes, I cannot deny that it was so much fun... and much better than that boring Bob Saget's comments! But the DVD extras were not that much, mostly repeated or humiliating and not funny! Still if you need a good laugh, I think you should go for this one and better watch it alone first before inviting your family :-)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2INL3AYAT6325," I do not own & will never own this film.  I saw it on HBO.  I was not thrilled to see about half the cast drop their clothes.  The Insider should have been best picture over this mess. This was the first Disney movie released after I was born.  The music did it for me & the musical numbers.  Not the best, other wise the movie was too long. For such a great film the DVD to it was disappointing.  NO extras.  The movie is only 13 years old.  There could have been such extras to put on the disc.  Disney needs to go to extras school. An excellant film.  As a 21 year fan & collector of Harrison's this is perfect.  He deserved an Oscar nomination for it.  This film made me a fan for Tommy Lee Jones, who did deserve his Oscar. I tapes this film for one reason:  Russell Crowe.  True, this is not the best movie in the world.  I don't even remember if it was released or was a cable, straight to video deal.  No contender for Best Picture, &  Russell did need to shave. I was looking forward to the DVD. Man, a let down. DVD starts out with some classic funny bit The Frank Sinatra with Sting as Billy Idol, Bill Clinton & the fast food.  Still very funny today.  But, then it went into a cut up mess.  Multiple cut up sketches. Then, the rest of the sketches THAT WERE COMPLETE were not best of sketches.  Any SNL or fan of the late Phil will be disappointed in this DVD. What can you say about the movies that started it all.  I've been a Star Wars fan & collector for 20 years now.  This is where we REALLY first learned about Harrison.  Forever the movie to compare others to, not some  nudity boat movie. I bought this movie for 1 reason:  Russell Crowe.  Not only can he act, he's gorgeous & he's my age.  The film gave him nothing to do & the story made him sound like he was a villian.  His character did nothing in  the story to deserve that.  Then, they needed a better looking actress to  play the daughter. I bought this film for 1 reason:  Russell Crowe.  Not only can this guy act, he's my age & he's gorgeous!  One thing, it is not a comedy.  I thought it was more of a drama. The film was great, but it is the least favorite of the four.  Why?  Jar Jar Binks!  I have no idea what George was thinking on that one.  We needed more Darth Maul.  George, DO NOT bring Jar Jar back for episode 2. I bought this movie for 1 reason:  Russell Crowe.  Not only can he act, he's my age & he's gorgeous.  This movie did need alot of work, the co-stars in it didn't even try. This is certainly not a best picture contender.  I was glad to have it letterboxed on the disc.  Wish the material could have been better for both the leads.  The other minor characters did nothing to help the film. I have always enjoyed this film.  Only the original Muppet Movie is better.  But, the DVD of the Muppet Movie is far superior.  Why?  The film is letterbox!!  Who ever thought of putting this film out nonletterbox should rethink what they are doing. I bought this film for one reason:  Russell Crowe.  Not only can he act, he's my age & he's gorgeous.  Only problem with the film was all the supporting characters, too much time was given to them. Now, I would never have bought this movie if it hadn't have been for Russell Crowe.  It is not my cup of tea but only for him.  He's my age, he can act & he's gorgeous! By far, this is my favorite Disney & what does it is the music.  Some Disney films may have characters I love more with the great music, but this one does it.  Well done by the Sherman Brothers. If I had to pick my favorite Disney movie, it would be this one.  Why, love the music!!  Too bad it is a typical Disney DVD with no extras.  Would have loved them. I did not think I would like this film.  It turned out great. Not the best, but well done.  Excellant music & I loved Eddie Murphy's character.  Disney did do a good job on this DVD, some extras & great picture quality. I remember going to see this film when it was released.  I have always enjoyed it.  Not a hit movie for some reason & not the best film ever made, but it is funny, Robin Williams doing his thing.  Just ordered the DVD.  I can finally watch it wide screen at home. I saw this movie for 1 reason:  Russell Crowe.  Not only can he act, he's my age & he's gorgeous!  This movie was not the best ever made, but it was fair better than most critics said it was. Although I have enjoyed all of the Pixar films, I was kind of ""stand offish"" about this film.  Monsters, Inc. is my favorite of their films.  But, I am pleasantly surprised.  I really enjoyed the characters, Bob & Helen mostly.  As a true Disney fan, I loved the tribute to Frank & Ollie.  Over all, a well done film. As a 21 year fan & collector of Harrison Ford I used to be first in the door opening day for his movies.  That stopped with Random Hearts.  I did not for this one either.  I am glad it was a hit for him, but he deserves better material.  Good extras & picture quality on the disc though. I bought my DVD player just to get this film!!  Great film. I write this, for the 2cd time, after the Oscar nominations.  This was the box office hit Russell needed.  Great extras in the package.  One thing I did not like about the film was the relationship between the brother & sister.  That was not needed! This is my least favorite of the Jurassic Park films.  Story line could have been better & they needed a ""female"" character in the film, not the one pretending to be an exwife & mother in it.  Real good extras on the DVD. I truly enjoyed the film, could have done without some of the ""gross out"" jokes.  Loved them making fun of Disney movies, even while being a Disney fan.  Good extras on it. I am glad I bought this DVD.  Being a fan of Russell's for 2 years now I had only seen a cut version on a cable channel.  Not the best thing ever put to film, but it good.  Did not need the nudity. I did really enjoy the first film.  This one was NOT quite as good.  But, I did LOVE the ""Idol"" extra feature.  That was great & I can watch that over & over again. Russell was cheated by not even receiving a nomination for this film.  I remember the exclaims heard from the crowd in the room the morning the nominations were annouced.  Another fine Peter Weir film.  The only thing we could have done without is the typical scenes of people becoming ill on a ship going through a storm.  Unnecessary. Being a fan of Al's for over 20 years I truly love this DVD with his best music videos on them!!  Can play some of them over & over again.  A great find for any fan of Al's. This is probably my favorite all time television show.  I was SO GLAD when this first season FINALLY arrived on DVD May of 2005.  An extra that would have been nice to see would have been the first episode of Danny's 1995 talk show where MOST of the cast members were there, only ones missing David & Susan.  I do have all the episodes on tape & will buy the other 3 seasons when they are released on DVD. Been looking forward to the release of this DVD set. One of my all time favorite TV shows. Why am I giving this only 4 stars? I was extremely disappointed to read that only Patrick Duffy & Linda Gray did commentary on 2 episodes. Where were all the other actors at? Would have BEEN much better to see Larry Hagman, Charlene Tilton, Steve Kanaly & Ken Kercheval appear & speak about episodes. I knew I would like the DVD.  And, I did.  Sure, there are sketches that are missing.  But, some great ones are here.  We could have used more Blues Brothers, Samurai, Weekend Update, Restaurant, etc.  Only 1 Blues Brothers & Restaurant.  2 Weekend Update ""But NO"", 2 famous Samurai bits.  1 Bee sketch because all of us fans know he did NOT like the Bee sketches.  The DVD is very good, but not perfect due to missing sketches. I have always enjoyed this film.  Only the original Muppet Movie is better.  But, the DVD of the Muppet Movie is far superior.  Why?  The film is letterbox!!  Who ever thought of putting this film out nonletterbox should rethink what they are doing. This is an ok movie.  We all know people went to see the special effects, not the lack of acting or a good story about the characters.  It is a good DVD with extras on it.  Good to hear Van Halen music in the film. I was looking forward to getting this season.  BUT  Claims to be UNCUT.  ONLY PARTIALLY UNCUT.  SOME language is uncut, some IS STILL CUT as aired on VH1  Other things uncut  Although I enjoyed the season I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE REUNION SPECIAL WAS NOT INCLUDED.  WHAT HAPPENED VH1?  This is a BIG let down for me.  A lot of other extras but NO REUNION SPECIAL Ok, a guilty pleasure.  I got into watching the show when it came on.  Course, you have only a short season of 8 episodes.  A down side-EPISODES AS THEY AIRED ON E!  THEY SHOW BE UNCUT.  Ok extras-1 extra program & episode commentary by the older sisters.  I will purchase season 2 when it is released & will watch the 3rd season when aired spring of 2009.  Yes, I guilty pleasure I would say I watch. This is the first Disney film released after I was born.  I got into this film because of the music.  It is perfect!!  Both Julie Andrews & Dick Van Dyke were perfect in their roles.  Notice I use the word perfect as it was in the film.  Glad there are extras on the disc, surprising. ... If I had to pick my favorite Disney movie, it would be this one.  Why, love the music!!  Too bad it is a typical Disney DVD with no extras.  Would have loved them. By far, this is my favorite Disney & what does it is the music.  Some Disney films may have characters I love more with the great music, but this one does it.  Well done by the Sherman Brothers. I was prepared not to like this film.  I ended up loving it.  It is certainly not the best Disney film but it is great.  Excellant music.  Better than average Disney DVD.  A few extras on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2CYS44A322ZWX," Disk 1 is very good with live performances. Disk 2 was not that great and is videos. I wanted the song Rosalita as that is the best song and is missing from latest DVD's. This looks like an ancient relic relative to new concert DVD's. This is a rental only. This is not one of those concerts I would watch a second time and skipped thru much of it. This has some excellent songs/performances and more that are not so great (which you can skip over). This is NOT a five star performance like ""The Virgin Tour"" (1985) which I thought was five stars and much much better and which I have on VHS. Hopefully, they will produce a comprehensive Madonna DVD which encompasses the whole career in the next year or two. We watched this movie and The Mighty Ducks this weekend and both have similar story themes about the under-dogs and both are great movies for kids. Worth while renting or buying. We rented it. This is one of my kids favorite movies. They have watched it more than 5 times. Therefore, it is a BUY and good value. This is not one of those dvd's they play once and then it gathers dust forever.... This is MUST HAVE if you like Beatles music. This is the whole enchalada from beginning to the end. It is well presented and includes all the hits and the background information too. This is the only Beatles DVD you will need to get. This is one of the best music DVD's on the market. This is a great concert dvd with many outstanding performances. I had some people over and turned this on and everyone wanted to know what is was. They wrote it down because they wanted to buy it. This dvd is a keeper and good to show your friends. It's the best one of this kind (e.g. opera, musical) that I have found to date. This is a MUST HAVE if you like the Rolling Stones. This DVD has excellent sound quality and visual quality. This is the best Rolling Stones DVD on the market. This covers 40 years of hits with today's dvd technology. There are excellent performances by Clapton, Sanborn & Crow. The Blige and Dylan performances were not so good. A mixed bag. The other Clapton dvd's are probably better. Not a keeper but a good 1 off rental. I rented this thinking I may buy it. After watching I decided not to buy it. It is a mixed bag with Smooth being the best and the rest of it not that great. This one did not make my top 20 dvd concert collection. I listened to this band when I was in high school 30 years ago. Amazing they are still around. The good songs back then are still played well. This one is a keeper. It has the hits from the 70's plus some others I was not familiar with. This could be a 5 star exercise video but as for music it is 2 stars. I was thinking that maybe Janet would be in the same league as Madonna, Britney, Cher, Kylie, Christina... and found this dvd to have good costumes, sets, etc but the music and singing was not at all in the same league as those mentioned. This one is not a keeper. I have over 60 concert dvd's and this one would be in my top 5. This is a good summary of 40 years of music. This is a keeper. There is no other living musician with as many hits. Others that come close are Elton John (also in top 5). Overall, very good. I would take off one star for the ""look"" with black hair and strange face rings. Her overall appearance and ""look"" on reflection dvd was better. Best song is Beautiful. Not even Jessica Alba can save this really bad movie. Compared to other dance movies like Flashdance, Dirty Dancing, Footloose, Grease, etc. this is by war the worst. This one is not a keeper. Not recommended. If you want to see Jessica then get ""Into the Blue"" which is much better and that is recommended. This is an excellent concert dvd which includes all their hits. This dvd is a screaming buy!! This one is a keeper. If you liked them in the 1970's you'll like this. She has huge potential but none of the songs are that great. Her sister Ashlee is actually a better performer and has more edge in her songs and better lyrics or something. Overall, good but something missing in the songs or songwriting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1XYE1JGSL6S2J," I like this movie because it was action-packed and suspenseful. At first, I didn't want to see it but my dad made me. I'm glad he did. The DVD version has better sound quality and sharper imaging. I only gave it four stars because, even when the cold war was over, this American-made movie potrayed Russians as terrorizing commies. I consider this to be more of a psychological drama than a horror movie. Eight-year-old Rhoda has no remorse or feeling for the crimes she has committed, saying that it was ""their faults"". McCormack is a wonderful actress who could past her age in any movie. Overall, this is my favorite movie of all time and I recommend it to anyone who likes suspense with psychology. I don't have a lot to say about this movie except that it is not your typical mob drama and the family tragedy spewed on some major depression. This movie was not what I expected and the storyline had too many holes in it. This may sound cliche, but, this is seriously the funniest movie of the 1990s. Not only was I laughing throughout it, but you'd never think that hair gel, zippers, retards or spying on old women was something to laugh about. ""There's Something About Mary"" is the definite crown jewel comedy of the 1990s. This movie deals with the ignorance of white trash. Hilary Swank did a superb job in this movie and Kimberly Pierce must have had some huge balls to direct such a controversial film. Chloe Sevigny's acting was beyond your average Joe. I was in tears by the time the movie ended. It deals with the cruelty of human actuality. All of the media scrunity the movie recieved was positive and it deserved every award that was given to it. I had wanted to see this movie for a long time. Throughout the film, I felt as if I was floating in mid-air--hypnotized. The movie was sensual, listless, hypnotic and exquisite. I especially loved Kirsten Dunst as sexually provocative Lux Lisbon and suicidal, journal-writing Cecilia Lisbon, whom said in the beginning, ""Obviously doctor, you've never been a thirteen-year-old girl."" Overall, this is a beautifully made, elegant movie. I give huge props to Sofia Coppola in her directorial debut. I had heard so much scary stuff about this film in the summer of 2000. My ex and I decided to see it for ourselves. I was both disappointed and shocked. Harrison Ford's (a great actor) role was very nonchalant and dry in the film until you found out that he...(I don't want to spoil the ending). The movie had superior graphics and a classic cast (with Ford and Pfieffer). It was exactly what I expected...bone-chilling and on-the-edge-of-your seat-suspense. Horror films are not that popular anymore. But ""Valentine"" proved to be stylish and suspenseful. My favorite character was Lily (Jessica Cauffiel) because of her curly hair. Um, the movie wasn't predictable like other horror films. It got panned at the theaters (unfortunately), but not the less, I did actually enjoy it! For the old-fogies, ""Charlie's Angels"" 2000 may be a rip-off the 1970's hit series. But for me, it was a girl-powered a**-kicking manifesto! I loved Cameron Diaz as Natalie. I love it so much that my girlfriends and I have our own ""Angels"". I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, but this was really cute and humorous. There were many funny scenes-- but it wasn't all fun and games. The models were not ditzy, they were pretty hilarious. I also think that Monica Potter deserves more publicity because she is a great actress. Many girls around the country each year find themselves in these horrid positions. Kirsten Dunst did a superb job as Tina in this shockingly realistic film. I felt sorry for her as she had to put her young life on hold-- but then I didn't because she was like any fifteen-year-old girl: naive, vulnerable and harmfully impressionable. Any girl should watch this movie before giving herself away to any carnal, uncaring, hormonally imbalanced boy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A7LMT1G8ZAJ2X," Harrison Ford played the role of President of the United States very well.  And he expressed solemnity as the President and humor as Harrison Ford.  The story line is not as simple as it seemed at first sight. It is  elaborated in great detail.  This film is not showy but worthseeing.  Thank  you. I can't understand why so many people admire this movie.  This movie didn't touch me and left me nothing except that I knew there was a movie like this. But some people may get someting from this movie. After all,  you have to see yourselfe and think about this.  Thank you. This movie shows human's real heart in a real panic. I think this movie is high quality and everyone can enjoy. I would like to recommend this to you from my heart! Thank you. There are many movies in the world. But few movies  make a deep impression on us. This movie is one of them. If you are fed up with this restless society, you should see this movie. I like this movie,because the story line is so  elaborated. But,my only dissatisfaction is that  the story and the characters are too complicated to understand ,so you have to see this twice. First I'm very happy to meet this movie. I like the way the narrator talks and this music is nice. I think this movie is well worth seeing. I hope many people see this movie and enjoy. I have seen few horror movies in my life. Before seeing this movie, I  didn't think that this was a horror movie. On the contrary, it had many  scaring scenes. I thought I shouldn't have seen this movie.  But when I  finished seeing it, I was surprised and moved. I want you to see this one  and understand my feeling. Thank you. I have seen few horror movies in my life. Before seeing this movie, I  didn't think that this was a horror movie. On the contrary, it had many  scaring scenes. I thought I shouldn't have seen this movie.  But when I  finished seeing it, I was surprised and moved. I want you to see this one  and understand my feeling. Thank you. I saw this film with high expectation. And it lived up to my expectations. A musical performance in this film sometimes make us laugh and sometimes  make a deep impression on us.  Meryl Streep and kids are good combination.  I'm sure that you'll be satisfied with this film and after wathing you  love classical music. Thank you. First,I'd like to say that this movie is terrible. I saw this movie in the theater with my friend. And when we finished seeing the movie, we were discouraged. I could't say anything. I think I don't want increase victims  like me. Seeing this movie is waste of time,and makes you angry I guess. First,I want to say that what is the point in this movie? I could not understand this movie's point. This movie left me nothing. I do not say that actor and actress are bad, but the concept of the movie is poor. Thank you. There was a heavy atomosphere in this movie. It made me concentrate on the movie and I was tired after seeing it.  The scene of this movie is in  ancient Roma. Especially in Colosseum where many gladiator are fighting for  their own freedom.  I enjoyed this movie a lot. Probably you will enjoy  too. Thank you. I saw this movie after seeing the sixth sence. So I could not be excited. I could foresee the ending. But I could enjoy the special atmospher. If you do not see the sixth sence, you can enjoy this naturally. Thank you. A new star and a old star cooperate and get the top. A race scene is very exciting. Especially, driving on a public way is unblievable. Indeed, a story line is poor, but you must be satisfied only with the racing scenes. I think acting is good. You won't be disappointed. Thank you. I am Japanese. So I don't know American version. I think Japanese does't translate into English correctly. If you want to understand this film fully, you should watch Japanese version. But you wil be touched anyway. I would recommend this to all. This movie consists of SF and family love. I could not foresee the ending. So I was excited through the movie. I would like to recommend this movie to you all. You must be satisfied. Thank you. I like this movie,because the story line is so  elaborated. But,my only dissatisfaction is that  the story and the characters are too complicated to understand ,so you have to see this twice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AT2BYFEVLVITT," I am a big fan of Harrison Ford's movies, and Air Force One is no acception. There is tons of action, and the story is great. I honestly couldn't imagine any other actor being able to pull this role off, Harrison  Ford was perfect as the President. This movie is quite funny, but the humour starts to die off after the first half hour. I mean, there are only so many stonner jokes you can do. Not something i would buy, just rent. I love any movie with car chases, and this has some of the best. Although adding heavy firearms and bazookas helps. The story wasn't anything special, just lots of action, which totally made the movie worth while. Chris Farley was one of the funniest people in the world. I was so sad and disapointed when I heard about his death. Thankfully Saturday Night Live released this compilation of some of his funniest moments on the show. This  and the movie Tommy Boy is how we can all remember him by. This compilation  is great for a laugh, it is just hilarious. This is a very good action flick. The story could use a little work, but I really can't complain. A lot of the action done with the plane was amazing. There are plenty of large explosions and destruction to wet the appetite,  many of which are quite funny. Particulary the scene where a mint Corvette  is flying through the air. I had a chance to see this on an IMAX screen and the visuals of Egypt were terrific, but what made this movie bad was having actors try to tell a fictional story. This would of been much better as just a straight  documentary feature, instead they tried to ""Hollywood"" it up,  with poor results. My suggestion is, rent this :) I usually steer clear of any film that has something to do with romance, but I wanted to see this one because of Tom Hanks being in it. I surprisingly liked it. It basically just has a lot of humerous situations  throughout the movie building up to the tear jerking ending. Definetly a  movie worth seeing. This movie would of been better without the nudity. I thought this movie was going to be more of an action flick, at least thats what the previews seemed to protray it as. Instead in turns into an adult love affair.  Disapointing. Don't get me wrong the movie is entertaining, but its not something i would watch over and over again, and to me thats one reason for buying DVD's, the replayability. The one reason i would buy this is to see Denise  Richards. See is worth the price of admission :) I saw this series originally on television. TLC ran it a couple of times, and I thought it was one of the best documentary type series I have seen. It was very interesting to learn about where the founders of the city of  Rome came from, how the city grew, and how the empire expanded. If you are  interested in Rome, this is a great series to watch. All the scenes in this movie in which Mel Gibsons character can hear what women are thinking are hilarious, but the scenes in which he can't I found to be rather boring. Overall the movie is quite good, I wasn't that disappointed with it. Some of the jokes you could hear all the women in the audience laugh, but I didn't get what was so funny about them. This is definetly a chick flick. I went into this movie that it was going to be stupid. But I didn't even find it funny. Sure there are some scenes that make you laugh, but its cause they are so pathetic. The acting was terrible all around, and the story made no sense what so ever. This is just a bad movie with a cool title. Scary Movie has no plot, bad acting and a story that doesn't make sense,  but who cares, the movie is absolutely hilarious. I was cracking up  laughing numerous times throughout the movie. It spoofs the Scream type  movies with a variety of gags and some crude humour. If you are a fan of  those Scream movies or even if you are not, you should still checkout this  movie, its great for a laugh. When i saw this at the movies, I thought it had one of the coolest opening  scenes i'd seen, and the effects throughout the movie were great. After  seeing the movie a few times, the ooOO's and ahhh's have worn off, and I  really notice how cheesy the acting in this movie is. I still think that  the movie is half decent because of the special effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2LSRBVD2MK3PL," ""American Beauty"" is a flat out masterpiece, the film is great from every angle, acting, directing, music, editing, etc. Kevin Spacey's  performance stands out as the best of the bunch in this movie, the rest of  the cast gives great performances as well. This film is beautiful,  intoxicating, and mesmerizing. This film truly deserved it's Best Picture  award. This film is great that is all I can say. ""Eraser"" is not Arnold Schwarzenegger's finest film but it is still good nonetheless. The effects and action in this film are all top notch and the performances from the cast are good also. I recommend this  film. Come on people! What's with all this ""Titanic"" backlash? This is a great movie that will stand the test of time. It is true the movie is not the best ever but it is a great movie. I highly reccomend this movie. ""Hard Boiled"" is singlehandedly the most spectacular action film I have seen. The shootouts in this movie are as thrilling and as intense as any I have seen. Director John Woo is extrodinary at directing action  scenes, and after this film you will see why. This movie makes most  american action movies look anemic. Don't miss this film it will blow you  away. ""Hard Boiled"" is without a doubt the best pure action film I have ever seen, it makes ""Die Hard"" look like a buggy ride to your grandmothers house. The action in this movie is jaw dropping, the  shootouts are so wll choreographed that they almost look like a ballet. The  action is hypnotic. For fans of action movies there is no other choice but  ""Hard Boiled"". ""Speed"" in my opinion ranks as one of the best action movies of all time. It has a clever plot, excellent pacing, great direction. This film is a non stop ride, it never slows down. Most of the other reviews for  this movie are correct so there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been  said already. ""True Lies"" is a spectacular movie, it has some of the most amazing action and stunts ever filmed for the screen. This film also has some funny comedy moments also, while the DVD doesn't have any extras to  speak of, but the transfer is great. I really like this movie. Personally I thought that this film had more action than the rest of the trilogy combined. This film features good performances from Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor and George Lucas did a good job directing. I reccomend this  film. I caught this movie a few months back on HBO, I was expecting it to be a T&A fest but it wasn't. It is funny in parts, though the story is thin this movie will still entertain you. ""The Rock"" is a very solid action movie, it could have been better but it also could have been alot worse. The reason this movie is good is because it has interresting characters. For this film to be really  appreciated though it must be seen on a big screen. ""Dr. Dolittle"" is a very funny film definitly one of Eddie Murphy's best films. This is a film that the whole family can watch and they will all be entertained. I also think that this is an underrated movie  it is very funny and you will not be dissapointed. ""Speed"" in my opinion ranks as one of the best action movies of all time. It has a clever plot, excellent pacing, great direction. This film is a non stop ride, it never slows down. Most of the other reviews for  this movie are correct so there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been  said already. ""Boogie Nights"" is a great movie, the whole cast turns in remarkable performances. Though the subject matter is very touchy it is handled expertly by a very talented young director. This film has echoes of  such other great movies ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Raging Bull""  and ""GoodFellas"". And it is almost as good as those films if you  ask me, if you want a great movie to watch you can' t do much better than  ""Boogie Nights"" It has ben nerly 16 years since ""The Terminator"" came out, and it is still a great movie. Some movies lose their shine after a few years but ""The Terminator"" has not. This was the role Arnold  Schwarzenegger was born to play, nobody could have been better. Though I do  love this movie, the DVD has no extras besides a theatrical trailer and the  transfer is only moderatly good. But you can't go wrong with this movie. ""Twister"" is a wild ride of a film that is also non-stop fun. The tornadoes in this film are staggering, brought to life by amazing visual effects, I can't really say to much about this movie except that it  is always exciting and fun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3P121GNV5QYIN," I hated the Spice Girls before this movie and then I hated them even more after I saw it. Stupid,boring and dull only a child under the age of 10 would like this huge mess. I saw this film when I was 13 and I loved it. I only knew two actors in this movie and that was Anthony Perkins and Shirley Maclaine,both whom were wonderful in their roles. It's funny,charming,cute and a classic. Enjoyable film for anyone,nomatter what the age is. Like the title says,I didn't find anything great about this movie,it was boring,dull and so weak that I fell asleep watching it. And no,I saw this long before I saw Resident Evil,which I found more entertaning then this. I've heard so much about this movie in the last year,so I thought I'd give it a shot. And boy,was I let down. It was dull,boring and pointless. I couldn't get a damn about who lived and who died,I liked only one thing about the movie and that's the first death in the film. I know alot of people love this film and some people (like me) didn't. But,to each his/her own right? I saw this movie when I was about 4 and totally fell in love with it,well conserting I love sci-fi I general,it was nowonder I loved this so much. Three different kids(brain,beatuy and brawns)build a spaceship out of a old tilt a whril rideseat,to find out where all the singles they're getting are from. Really fun,entertaining story,directed by Joe Dante,whom brought us Gremlins. I recommened this film for any fan of children's films or sci-fi films. I know I'm gonna be hated after this review but I found AOTC to be very boring. Even though the action scenes were awesome and Yoda's lightsaber duel was spectacular,I found the love story to be dull and boring. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie in the theater when it came out. I've been a Star Wars fan all my life and I was greatly dissapointed in this movie. I hope episode three is better. My review is based on the trailer that's out in theater's right now. Spider-Man 2 takes place two years after the first one with Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) still trying to both hide his identity and try to live his life. I don't want to spoil it anymore then that one little tid bit I just said. Still directed by Sam Rami(The Evil Dead series and Spider-Man)this film should be the biggest blockbuster of the summer. It's got great eye candy in it with Kerr Smith(Jack from of Dawson's Creek) and Brendan Fehr(Michael from of Roswell)other then that,the movie [wasn't good].I mean,you ever heard of a vampire with no fangs?Rent The Lost Boys,Blade1+2,Queen Of The Damned and Interview With The Vampire other then this for your vampire kick. This movie ranks high up there with The Natural as one of the best baseball movies ever made. The Rookie is a really great movie for both the kids and adults,really makes you believe your dreams can come true no matter what age you are. This movie made my baseball dream come alive again after not playing for 4 and a half years. Watch it and love it. I was so dissapointed after watching this big mess and I was looking forward to seeing this because I loved Willam Malone's last film,House On Haunted Hill. I thought Fear dot com would be gorier and freaker then HOHH,but boy,was I really dissapointed. Halfway through the film,I keep wondering when are they gonna diliver the blood and gory and it never came. Don't enter Fear dot com,you'll regret it. Watch House On Haunted Hill instead. One of my favourite show to re-watch in the 90s before he became Bond. Can't wait for July for this to come out which will be added to my ever-growing list of DVD's",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1VFCX7D378LXO," This movie is a really fun film. Alot of people label it as plain stupid, but I wonder.....WHY CAN'T THEY JUST ENJOY IT FOR WHAT IT IS??? JEEZ, THESE ARE THE SPICE GIRLS!!!!!!!! THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FUN AND WACKY COMEDY!!! Please, take my advice and give this movie a try. You might just like it. If you're lookin for a funny feel-good movie, well, look no further. CANADIAN BEACON is one of John Candy's BEST! A real classic! Be sure to check out some of Candy's other great movies, too: UNCLE BUCK, THE GREAT OUTDOORS, COOL RUNNINGS, AND SUMMER RENTAL. I was shocked when I saw all the terrible reviews for ""End of Days."" This movie was great! Schwarzenegger is a powerhouse (as always, of course), Byrne excels in his role of Satan, and Tunney is outstanding. I highly recommend this movie to Schwarzenegger fans and action fans alike! Gladiator would have to be one of the best movies ever made. The storyline and battle scenes are wonderful and the acting is stunning. Russell Crowe delivers an amazing performance as well as the handsome Joaquin Phoenix. A really good hero/villain duo. If you're ever looking for a good war/drama movie, this would have to be it. Buy it. YOU WILL BE ENTERTAINED. I think this movie could have been better. Jurassic Park was excellent, the Lost World was acceptable, Jurassic Park 3 isn't worth it. Now, the action was pretty good, but the storyline was awful. One more thing.....1 HR. AND 37 MINUTES? IT WASN'T LONG ENOUGH! Take my advice and DON'T waste your money on this stupid sequel. Your not missing a thing. I only gave it 2 stars because of the awesome raptors. What's so wrong with this movie? I thought it was good. People just don't want to appreciate it for what it is. Angelina Jolie was perfect as our leading lady Lara Croft. So, here's my advice: Don't pay any attention to those 1, 2 or 3 star reviewers and see this movie. You may like it. This is definitely (without a doubt) a very superb movie. Of course, the brilliant Robert De Niro delivers a wonderful performance. Believe me, this is NOT one of those predictable movies such as the disappointing ""Jurassic Park 3"". ""The Score"" is worth every penny of your money. The storyline, the cast, everything is great. I can't wait until the DVD comes out. Oh yeah, the best part-----EXPECT A GRAND FINALE. National Lampoon's Van Wilder is everything but dull. Ryan Reynolds, Tara Reid and the rest of the cast were perfect. A few scenes (the eclair one to be exact) will make you laugh...and sick. The one scene I didn't care for was when Van was with the principal (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). Van Wilder is definitely worth watching (maybe even twice). Right now I desperately want the soundtrack. The music was GREAT. The reason I love this movie soooo much is because it's simply and funny. It's impossible not to laugh at the sweet dumb-blonde Melody (Tara Reid). I know that alot of people turn this movie down because they think it's stupid, but behind all the humor you actually learn something. Alexander Cabot said it best: ""I'm not what I wear""! I highly recommend Josie and the Pussycats. Definitely two thumbs way up. When I saw the previews for this movie, it looked really great. I was so eager to see it! When I finally got to, Tenenbaums turned out to be better than I thought! The acting was amazing and Gene and Owen were hilarious! I highly reccomend this movie. I'm definitely going to see it again. I absolutely loved ""Insomnia."" The casting was perfect (Al Pacino, Robin Williams). I was on the edge of my seat mostly the whole time! This beautifully made film ranks #1 on my list of best summer movies. I highly recommend ""Insomnia."" ""Death to Smoochy"" is laugh-out-loud hilarious! Robin Williams and Edward Norton were GREAT. The whole concept? No one puts Rainbow Randolph out of work! DIE SMOOCHY DIE!! I recommend this film to everyone (even if you're not fond of dark comedies). Totally original and brilliantly directed by Danny DeVito, ""Death to Smoochy"" has become one of my favorites! Gaudi Afternoon is a gem, most notable for its beautiful cinematography. A truly colorful film, not to mention a very colorful script...and, of course, a colorful cast. Judy Davis is wonderful, Marcia Gay Harden is dazzling, Lili Taylor is superb, and Juliette Lewis is irresistibly sweet! Gaudi Afternoon's originality shines; a rare find that deserved a LOT more credit than it received. I'm definitely buying this one on DVD!! I saw Bad Company on the day it released. It's a perfect action-comedy. The title was perfect, too. Anthony Hopkins + Chris Rock = Bad Company I couldn't have hoped for a better movie. It had just the right amount of comedy to keep you laughing and just the right amount of action that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. So, be sure to see this summer hit! What's so wrong with this movie? I thought it was good. People just don't want to appreciate it for what it is. Angelina Jolie was perfect as our leading lady Lara Croft. So, here's my advice: Don't pay any attention to those 1, 2 or 3 star reviewers and see this movie. You may like it. STUDIO STOOPS (1950) - an excellent stooge short! A Shemp classic! CRIME ON THEIR HANDS (1948) - Alot of people found this one to be a weak and uninteresting short. I really enjoyed it! Shemp swallows a diamond! Another Shemp classic! SHIVERING SHERLOCKS (1948) - A hilarious stooge short! The haunted house scene is really funny! Yet another Shemp classic! STUDIO STOOPS, CRIME ON THEIR HANDS, and SHIVERING SHERLOCKS: 3 great must-haves for any stooge fan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1L8IB1K8ETJW9," Seven is a great move, one of the best I've ever seen.  Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are excellent.  The movie is has a fast pace and is never dull.  It's filled with suspence and mystery.  Blus the DVD comes with all kinds of great extra features. The thing that sucks about this DVD is how it's cut, I mean it will cut off right in the middle of the song.  It gets really annoying...but it does have the videos of ""Breakdown"" and ""The Roof"" 2 of Mariah's best videos. This is a cute movie.  It's a teen comedy that is funny without being gross.  the movie is about 2 sisters.  One is kinda a loner(Kat) while the other is Miss Popularity(Bianca).  Anyway Bianca can't date until Kat does so, the guys who like Bianca try to figure out a way to get Kat out on a date. :) There arn't many speical fearture..just the trailer. I'm not into Kung Foo flicks at all and thought this movie would be bad, but boy was I wrong! This movie is great, it's very entertaining and the story just drags you in...also it just looks all beautiful, espeical the scenes in the bamboo trees.  Breathtaking! Also the DVD has a lot of special features. This movie was just awful...it wasn't funny at all.  I loved the first sone but this was just not good.  There was one or 2 funny moments but it was just basically to stupid. Not that the movie is bad or anything.  It has it's funny moments.  But I wouldn't spend money on buying the DVD.  It's not one of those movies that you want to or need to see a few times.  Once is enough. if the commercials didn't give the whole movie away! It's a good suspense story.  It moves kinda slow, but that's still alright.  There is enough to keep you interested, but I still wish they didn't give away everything in the commercials. This movie was just boring.  The only funny parts were in the commercials.  The movie was also so predictable, that even before I watched it I knew what was going to happen. I loved this movie!  1 second after I saw this movie I knew I had to get the DVD when it came out.  This movie has everything, great story, wonderful actors...I can go on and on, but just get the movie already! :) This movie was just dumb, but some parts were funny that why it got 2 stars.  It seems like the move was trying too hard to be the next Bill & Ted...but you know that's not gonna happen. When Hanks is the cast away the movie is great..him on the island and him trying to get off of it, but the rest is just boring and the ending isn't that great. Half of this film is good, and the other part is just so slow. I have to say I was a little dissapointed with the movie because of all the hype, but is was still really good.  It has a few different story line witch all kept my interst. I think everyone should check it out and rent it, but I wouldn't buy it, there is no reason for repeat viewings. This is a great movie, It has a good story and really amazing characters. Giuseppe Sulfaro played the little boy ni the movie so well, at times he was hella funny and at other times I just felt so bad for his character. And Monica Bellucci was great, I don't think anyone else could havereally pulled off her roll.  Even through everything, she made Malena was very dignified and made you want everything to turn out for the best. This is a funny movie.  It's also a little sick, so if your not into that then this might not be your cup of tea.  The skinny nerdy kid is the funniest thing in this movie.  The movie is about well what the title says, a road trip.  And of course all kinds of funny and zany things happen to these guys. You would think that with this cast the movie would be good.  But a bad story and script can't be saved no mattered how good an actor is or how big of a star they are.  There are a few funny parts but not many.  The movie is mostly very bland and boring. Coyote Ugly is about a girl from jersey who want sto be a song writer, so she moves to the big city to try and make her dreams come true.  Of course things happen and she has to get a job and ends up working at the bar ""Coyote Ugly"".  Where she meets friends, a guy, and well maybe a nice happy ending. This movie has a great story that we've all have seen before.  Someone comes to a school and gets the kids to be nice and play together.  It's is a feel good movie and does tug on the heart strings.  Also Denzel Washington is in it, you really can't go wrong with that. This is a good movie.  The characters and the  actors performances are the best thing about it.  Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger were great as was basically everyone else.  The plot of the movie was good, but some of the things got a little tired. The idea for this movie is good.  ""What would my life be like if... I had done this instead of that"".  It's really a hit and miss movie.  Some parts are really great and funny, while others are just boring.  And the ending is a pretty bad ending.  Since there is no ending. the movie was okay, but a part of me knows that this could have been a great movie, if it had a better script or a better director.  But the cast was great.  There didn't seem to be much on this DVD as far as the special features goes. the movie was okay, but a part of me knows that this could have been a great movie, if it had a better script or a better director.  But the cast was great.  There didn't seem to be much on this DVD as far as the special features goes. This movie wasn't as bad as the other reviews made it out to be.  It's a chessy B-movie and if you enjoy them a little then ""Wicked"" is an okay flick to watch.  There are a lot of little twists and turns that kept me interested.  I would say that ""overall"" it's not that bad. This was an okay movie.  It had it's funny parts. This movie is about 3 girls who are in a band The Pussycats.  When they are walking a across the street a guy sees them and thinks he can make them into the next big thing. That could have been the title of this movie.  If you liked ""Clueless"", you'll like this one.  It's about a ""dumb"" blonde who isn't taken seriously buy her boyfriend.  So she decideds to go to Harvard Law School to get him back to prove that she's smart enough for him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2W8GURWX2CGQ6," Ya, the spice girls aren't nearly as popular as they used to be, ok not at all, but sure ther were when they were around! And so that makes this a pretty good movie since I was a big spice girl fan. These girls are really funny here! I loved this movie! It's very touching, it's sad and made me cry at the end, but it does have some funny parts thax to the cute young boy in the movie!) It's basically about a 13 yr old girl and her little brother who dislike their stepmom and, like all, absolutely love their real mom. You watch and see the rest. I only watched this movie cuz kid actor Miko Houghs is in it, hes so adorable, and he is a great actor, basically the only thing keeping me entertained. Miko plays young Jordan. Overall I didn't like this movie well enough to give it a 5, but it's ok. Oh this is a good movie! I first saw it when I was maybe around 9 or 10, I loved it! Its about a girl growing up with her family probably around the 70's in a city of New York. A Very good movie! Potheads! Hippies! 'Its all about the weed yo!' LOL...This movies alright, Its all about these pothead guys that try to earn money to bail their friend outta jail by selling weed....Its pretty funny 2! It's all about the old school dayz! The movie takes place back in the  hippie dayz of 1976 in late May, the last day of school. It's about the  seniors giving the incomeing freshmen a hard, hard time, but then some  befriend. Its coo, man! This isn't the best kids movie out there, but its not too bad. Its not just for the little kids this time since it is about young teens. Of coarse it has that red headed boy thats in like every single kids movie, hes kinda weird, anyway theres only 2 cute boys in this one! anyway gotta go 4 now! I just saw this movie 4 the 1st time this weekend, I liked it a lot, it was on right after the movie sixteen candles, so it reminds me of that movie since the main girl is also in that movie too, anyway, this is a great movie. Its an older one about a girl who is poor and not very popular who has a popular rich guy crushing on her. I watch this movie every Cgristmas. It's a great classic for kids and adults! the classic story that took place like when my parents were little (I think)  of a young elementary boy who wants a red rider BBgun for christmas, but everybody says ""Youll shoot your eye out, youll shoot your eye out!"" I just got done watching this, I liked it! Its about a 7 year old who is a genius and his mom and he must decide weather or not he should go to college at his young age. Its really good! This beats all the disney channel movies! Its about skating, which is kool, Its about a surfer/skater guy from sunny California comeing to stay with family for a few months in cold snowy Chicago. His cousin who he stays with, is Seth Green, who basically plays a dorky outcast. And this surfer guy falls for this girl...you check it out! I love these My Girl movies! I thought the 1st one was defenatly more sad than this one. Vada is now off to California on her own to vistit her uncle, his girlfriend and son, Nick who is Vada's age, 14. Nick takes Vada through the city of ange;\ls to find clues to her mother's history. Nice happy ending! Im 14 now and I still love to watch this great classic baseball movie! If you like this you will probably like The Sandlot and the other two angel in the.. movies. I dunno, the only reason I'm gvin it this many stars is cuz Brian Bonsall, hes a great kid actor. But Bob sagget, not the greatest for the part, but umm, it wasn't THAT bad of a movie, pry kids will like it if they like nature camping and stuff. Trust me, this is a GREAT movie for teen girls! I love it! It's like one of my favorites! And I'm just like these charecter blond and clueless!) Okay all you trendy clueless girls, watch this! This movie is pretty good, but I think it was so typical, theres a lot of movies about kids who cant play a sport and it has that red headed kid who is in like every kids movie! anyway its about young kids who cant play soccer and don't know the first thing about it. Ya might like this if you like the movies Swiching Goals and Ladybugs. The first time I watched this was a few years ago, so I don't remember it all that much, but I do remember that I loved this movie! Its about an overweight boy who has to go to a summer camp for heavy weight kids! Its really good. This used to be one of my fave movies when I first saw it in like 4th or 5th grade. It's a really good movie starring the younger Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Chevy Chase. At first I only watched this cuz I heard that now 17 yr old Michael Galeota played in it when he was younger, and it was a good movie, it also has some other young boy actors like Blake Bashoff when they were younger, It's a cute movie. This is one of those movies that I would watch over and over every day when I was about 10. I love this movie, of coarse,I don't watch it much anymore, but I think its actually well acted and moste like a movie than all their other movies! I used to watch this everyday, I really liked Buckweat a lot. I liked  these charecters a lot! Its about these little boys and their he-man women  haters club and little alfalfa (Bug Hall) falls for young Darla, I think  you know how it goes! This movie is so stupid, I thought it was a total waste, the only reason I added an extra point was for Mario Yedidia's small appearence at the end, cuz hes a Hott-E! anyway, overall I really disliked this movie! great movie! cute kids, good acting! I saw this on the Disney Channel, and at first it didn't look very appealing to me, but I couldn't stop watching it, I loved it! Its great for kids of all ages!) This is awsome! I used to watch it with friends in the 6th grade and we became spies then! anyway, Harriet is played by now 14 or 15 yr old Michelle Trachtenberg, whos a great young actress! This is a great kids movie! This is an awsome movie! it's one of my top favorites! It's about a boy who as he grows up, he grows up, and I mean grows up! like he ages, lets say when he was 12 he would look like hes 30, and when he graduated he looked like he was 80. It's a very good movie, and Mario Yedidia is in it, and hes hott! This movie stars a hott kid, Brock Pierce, Hes a really good young actor! It also has Sinbad and Zachary Ty Bryan from Home Improvement. It's basically about the First Kid (The president's son) trying to fit in at his new public school, it's really good!!! This is very good, it's a lot like It Takes Two, the movie staring the olsen twins, the two are very simialar. This one stars Lindsay Lohan as herself, twice! the girls meet at a summer camp and decide to switch places so they can meet the mom or dad that theve never met, plus try to get them  back togeather, but the dad is about to marry a young woman who hates kids. Pretty Good. I LOVE this movie! Itz so funny! Especially the part where Ben stiller picks up that mental hitch hiker and he just rambles on and on not makin no scense! Youll understand when u see it! Its just so funny, and good youll love it if you like romantic comedies. Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, a great movie about an internet ""couple"" who finally make plans to meet. They hardley knew each other, but then again... they did! see what I mean when you've got mail. This is one of my favorites right now, It's very good, a romantic movie It stars Drew Barrymore and the increadibly georgeous Michael Vartan. It's basically about a newspaper reporter goes undercover as a high school student, and never been kissed. This is an increadibly funny movie too! This is a pretty good movie, it wasn't all THAT scarry, but it was entertaining enough to watch. It did have some scarry parts though so Ive got to give it some credit there. 12 yr old Haley Joel Osment plays the main charecter, and hes so cute! This is a good movie! This is a pretty good movie, it wasn't all THAT scarry, but it was entertaining enough to watch. It did have some scarry parts though so Ive got to give it some credit there. 12 yr old Haley Joel Osment plays the main charecter, and hes so cute! This is a good movie! Ive seen this movie so many times on the disney channel and I still like it! Its about this kinda dorky magic trick loving teen who bets his friends he can get a date for the dance.  Well-he does-well-sorta! When he goes to pick up this girl he is totally surprised that shes the presidents daughter! The movie makes the drive to the dance a total adventure! This movies about a 14yr old who comes from a poor family.  His dad is overseas and is left with his grandma.  The grandma passes away, so hes all alone. He rides a hourse on a journey all the way to New York to meet up with his dad, and its pretty good. I loved this movie- and Im not even one of those 'OH MY GOSH I LOOVE JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE' girls. Its a great movie and Justin can act! Its about an unpopular girl and a supermodel that looks exactly like her (movie magic!) and they switch places! I know, theres a lot of movies that do that (parent trap, olsen twins movies) but, this is really good! This is a Real Good movie! about snow day fun and snow day love. Its a really fun movie for kids and teens, and even parents, maybee. It's about a young teen love, snowball fights, sleds and the snowplow man all in a snow day! This movie is not as increadibly stupid as I thought it would be, it's really not that bad. It's about a little boy played by the adorable little Jonathan Lipniki, who wants a little brother, the parents get one at an adoption agency and ended up with stuart little, a mouse. This is an ok kids movie, like the movie Jack type, but the kids are not cute in this one! It stars that Ernest guy. Its an okay movie for like 9 and 10 yr olds. I loved this movie, and no Im not some 12 yr old girl with a crush on jtt, I just think hes an awsome actor. Its about a colledge kid, Jake who needs to get home for Christmas if he wants his dad's porshe. But all of a sudden he wakes in a dedert wearing the santa uniform, then he starts the adventure home. This is so coo! It's about an unresponsible 32 yr old played by Adam Sandler who wants to prove to his ex that dumped him for an older responsible man that he is ready to grow up. So, he adopts a 5 yr old boy Julian played by the adorable twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse. It's a great funny movie! ok, I didn't really like the theme and all the songs and stuff, but the charecters are really cute. Im a lil too old for the corney music and to actually think its that funny, but Its still not that bad. The animaniacs go on a race to the wishing star in this movie. This is one of my favorite christmas movies, it's very touching, and fun.  With the adorable, hott 14 yr old Joseph Cross playing a 12 yr old boy,  Charlie, struggling to get through his fathers death. I know, it looks so  increadibly stupid by the previews b-cuz of the live snowman, but dude,  it's really not that bad, trust me! I sorra, but I thought this was a pretty dumb movie. It was a bore so much that I couldn't follow it well enough. It does have some good music and Will Smith though! This is like a blonde comedy, I love it! Kirsten Dundst plays the awsomest charecter! This movie is so funny! Its about two totally clueless 15 yr old blonde girls who in 1972 go on a class field trip to the white house and the president makes the girls ""The Official Dog Walkers"" for the whitehouse after they have walked into a top secret shreadding session, Check it out! This is pretty good actually, I enjoyed it. Its about this kid whos a big surfer in hawii and because of his dad, has to move and attend a prep school somewhere in the mountains where theres no waves, so he picks up a snowboard. Good fun Halloween movie takes place in a town where nobody celebrates Halloween, or even says the word Halloween because of a past tragety. The movie is about about a boys grandpa who dies after having a ""Halloween"" (getting hit on the head by a pumpkin) and comes back, as a good guy. Awesome movie! Actually though, I did expect it to be funnier, but it was funny in parts! Its a gr8 movie about a girl who gets to Harvard Law School just because her Boyfriend dumped her cuz he wanted a smarter law student to marry. And the reason she got accepted into the school is because of her good looks. On the way she learns true love and how much she really does love Harvard Law school! This movie has got way halarious parts! I loved it because it seems a lot like me and my best friend, and  a lot of the things in the movie and here where I live are halariously similar, this is one of my favorite movies! This movie wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. I actually really liked the plot- Jason (Frankie Muniz) writes a paper for school that he desperately needs to turn in, but this famous producer takes it and turns it into his own movie that only he will take credit for, but all Jason wants is his paper! This movie although lacks reality, is very good, I think that the reason why I might have liked it is because Im a bow wow fan, but it is a good kids movie. I think all ages could like this movie, as long as your somewhat of a basketball fan, well maybee not even that. With famous basketball star Michael Jordan of Chicago Bulls starring along with cartoon classic Bugs Bunny and Moron Mountain space critters Loony Toons go head 2 head on the b-ball court.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3QDHY8XXAOV2U," I admit that this movie was good but it is no ""Hard Days Night"". Spice Girls tried to copy many things that were in HDN, for example, lateness for a concert. They made it seem as if they were trying to do the same thing that the Beatles did over thirty years earlier. The first time that I saw this, I really thought that Shelby (Julia Roberts) was a spoiled and inconsiderate brat. HOwever, after watching this movie ten times, I realized that I was wrong. she wanted a baby SO much. Julia Roberts played Shelby so well. I think that she got an Oscar nomination for this movie. Annie is the type of movie that I loved when I was 8 or 9 years old. I remember being mesmerized by the songs and the storyline! It was my absolute favorite movie during that time. Unfortunately, after watching Annie hundreds of times, I moved on to other movies. Annie came on TV last year and my interest was renewed. I also loved the songs that I ignored when I was 8 years old, for example, ""We Got Annie"". I made a huge mistake by doing this video BEFORE I did Volume 1. I had no idea about the lack of intensity and the equipment that was needed to do this workout. It totally turned me off to The Firm for a few months! March To Fitness was my second exercise video. The original Buns Of Steel was my first, but turned me off to exercising. Kathy Smith's video, on the  other hand, motivated me to exercise on a regular basis. I have been doing  her workouts for almost 6 years. She consistently adds fun into her  workouts. I found this workout to be fun and very unintimidating. My fav  part of it is when she does the 90s funk exercises! I actually watched this series when it was on PBS a couple of years ago and it almost brought me to tears. It was incredibly sad to hear about the way that the slaves were treated. This video would be a great learning experience for classes. I am thinking about using it as an visual aide for my speech on slavery in NY. Similar to the first video, I had a hard time completing this video when I did it for the first time. However, I was quite disappointed with it because it is nothing like the first video. I really like this movie because it is not the ""typical Meg Ryan movie"". It does not have her acting cutesy and adorable. It was not to see her play someone that is very different from the characters that she normally plays. I also liked the old man. He really had the Meg Ryan mannerisms down pact! :-) James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Sal Mineo gave Oscar worthy performances in this movie. I really like this movie because it has a teen's perspective. The parents don't seem to understand them, for example, when Judy wanted her father to show her some affection. I really did not want to see this movie the first time that I saw it. I reluctantly sat with my cousins, my sis, my bro, and a friend to watch it. During the film, I got really enthralled into the storyline. It was really sad when little Cory died. Anyway, a few years later, I read the book. The movie did not stay true to the book. It ended very differently. At first glance, I really did not like WW2 because it was not like WW. The second time I watched it, it was a laugh riot. I realized that WW2 is not like WW because it is much better. The storyline was soo creative. What other movie actually mocks karate movies with dubbed voices? :-) This video has a perfect combination of weight training (Susan Harris) and cardiovascular(kai shoremaken)....the only thing that i do not like about it is that silly aerobic routine towards the end of the workout.....i wouldn't recommend that people with two left feet do that section. I really love the fact that this tape targets the problem areas (abs, hips, and thighs). Every section is really good. The floor work for the legs is GREAT! The best part of the workout is the abs. My sis really loves the ab workout. This is the ab workout that she usually likes to do on ""Five Day Abs""! I was a bit disappointed that both Dream On and Walk This Way were not included in the album. However, the CD still rocks. I love to crank up the volume whenever ""Love In An Elevator"" comes on! ""Dude Looks Like A Lady"", ""Janie's Got A Gun"", and ""Ragdoll"" are also songs that I like to [turn it] up! I will admit that I don't know any alcoholics and I have not experienced the effects. However, I thought that Meg Ryan was very believable. She seemed as if she was really drunk especially during the scene when her little daughter watched her pop pills and drink at the same time. If you are looking for a great ab workout, then this tape is for you. It actually includes five excellent abdominal workouts from the original total body Firm tapes. As you progress into the ""days"", the workouts increase in intensity AND duration. This workout is a little hard to do when you first do it, but it gets better everytime you work out with it. I was barely able to walk after I did this workout for the first time. After a while, the squats became easier to do. I recommend this anyone who loves a challenging leg workout. this is a great workout if you just want to concentrate on exercising your legs! it is such a challenging workout! I always have a firm feeling in my legs after completing this workout. The ads for this movie made Cher seem like a total snob and very superficial. Cher, however, matures throughout this movie. I loved the way that she was totally clueless about her own lovelife!!! It was so ironic that she was the matchmaker for Skye and Elton and her teachers. I also loved the way that this movie poked fun of teens and the ""teen lingo"". This is a great workout to do whenever you don't want to do something really strenous. However, it lacks the intensity of ""The Firm: Standing Legs"" video. The exercises are done really quick and it requires heavier weights than normal. This is a wonderful musical that I enjoy whenever I watch it. It is so funny to see Eliza Doolittle sound out the vowels! The singing is impeccable. Who knew that Audrey Hepburn had a singing voice double? You could never tell by looking at this movie. :-) My favorite scene is when Eliza is ""unmasked"" at the horse races. :-) I was 9 years old when I saw Pollyanna for the first time. My mom and I rented it. Anyway, I was really impressed with it. The whole movie was great! I actually watched it several times during the few days that we had it! My favorite part of the whole movie is when the whole town comes to see Pollyanna before she leaves the ""Glad Town""! Even though this video requires the use of a barbell, it is still quite intense. Viewers that don't own a barbell (like me) could substitute heavy weights instead. The aerobics section is a bit slower than the aerobics section in the ""Hare"" workout. While I was watching the movie, I noticed that the storyline is exactly the same as ""Clueless"". However, the settings are completely different. Anyway, I think that Gwyneth Paltrow did a very good job in this movie. I could totally relate to both Romy and Michelle in this movie because I know how it feels to be the laughing stock of a group of people in school. This movie brought back some painful memories of both my childhood and high school. The scene that really hit close to home was when both Romy and Michelle's were ""careers"" were unmasked. I saw the original 1930s version of this movie, and I was not very  pleased. It was a bit different than the glamorous 1950s version (with Lana  Turner). The best part of the 1950s version is during Annie's funeral  when Sarah Jane cried over the casket. I found this movie to be enjoyable from the beginning to the end. Who would have known that Princess Fiona becomes an ogre at sundown? The best feature of the DVD is the karaoke dance party. I played the DVD for some kids and they started dancing! I am not someone who usually gets scared while watching a scary movie. The Others, however, was very different. The movie has so many plot twists and the end is really surprising. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves thrillers! Ben-Hur has a really interesting storyline. Heston is a really good actor. this film deserved the 11 Oscars it received. Every scene in this whole movie is great. My favorite scenes are the chariot race and the scenes between Jesus and Judah Ben-Hur! Legally Blonde is the perfect movie to make you feel better. I love the way that Elle (Reese Witherspoon) totally proved everyone wrong about her. This movie proves that blondes are not dumb! Witherspoon has so much charisma! James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Sal Mineo gave Oscar worthy performances in this movie. I really like this movie because it has a teen's perspective. The parents don't seem to understand them, for example, when Judy wanted her father to show her some affection. I remember watching this movie every Mother's Day when I was younger, but it has been off television for many years now......It seemed like it took a while for it be on DVD......well...I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and i am very glad I bought it... I love to do this workout! However, I thought that it is really hard to do the ballroom aerobics without a short box. Anyway, the best section is the floor workout because it really targets those hard to tone areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2ZHSORK1HHYTT," Although the film is a bit dated, it is worth watching for Kim Basinger's performance as an illiterate bayou girl.  Compare this performance with the super smart callgirl in LA Confidential -- she does have range.  Buy it used at the cheapest price -- you won't be disappointed. Like many of you, I first saw this film on television years ago.  I liked it then so I bought it this week.  This film stands up to the test of time.  Paul Newman give an excellent restrained performance, as does Sally Field.  But the best scene in the film is when Paul assaults Sally at his warehouse and tears her blouse.  It is her reaction afterward that sells this movie.  Add this movie to your Newman collection. This a fun ""fantasy"" because never in the history of prostitution has there been a girl like Julia Roberts who walked the streets.  And was not hooked on drugs.  In real life, Roberts would have been a high class call-girl with an exclusive clientele.  To make her a hooker who flags down cars was absurd -- the writer should have did his research.  After you get past this major story WTF, the film becomes fun. The script is manifestly techically inaccurate.  A D.C. cop cannot investigate a homicide on federal property.  That is the job of the FBI, plus there are at least six more gross errors in this film.  With the kind of money they spent making this film, you'd think they could hire some high school kid to google the facts and get them right.  By pass this DVD, unless you want to rent it just to see Diane Lane. Clint plays a cop with several short-comings, especially whores.  He can't seem to get enough of them, and neither can the serial killer.  If the lead of this film was an unknown actor, you probably wouldn't watch it.  This film is for Clint Eastwood fans. And the winner is: Disc 1 The Final Cut  I have seen all the versions, and this one is the most powerful.  If you've never seen this film, watch The Final Cut first.  You will be glad you did.  And not enough can be said about the haunting beauty of Sean Young in her prime.  You end up wishing she was in every scene. A Cold War classic.  Peter Sellers is perfect in each role and the film satire is excellently written.  The movie does hold your attention all the way to the end -- the real end. Poor script, poor acting.  The only reason to buy this film is to look at Faith Domergue -- Howard Hughes lover since she was 15 -- and try to figure out why he spent millions trying to make her a star.  Yeah, he failed. The script is just okay, and the acting is just okay, but there is something about the gestalt of this film that has made me watch it three times.  Rent it first if you have to, then buy it for your DVD library. Anna (as played by Martha Byrne) was a bitch until the very end of the movie.  There was nothing sympathetic about this little girl, nothing we could cheer for.  Half way through the movie you are hoping she will get hit by a school bus. Both of these films are ""B"" or ""C"" films.  Of course both stories have absurd plot points (e.g. It! -- To try and kill the monster they shoot pistols, and rifles, and rockets at it -- inside the space ship!), but the films are okay for a lazy Saturday afternoon. Excellent film for the 50's sci-fi genre.  Richard Carlson gives his all out best in this ""B"" level film.  Buy a used DVD to add to your ""Day The Earth Stood Still"" genre collection. Anthony Hopkins does a stereotypical job as Hitler, but everyone else in the film was obviously British playing like Germans.  If you are an actor and hired to act like a German soldier, then act like a German soldier and not like a Brit impersonating a German soldier.  Nothing new historically in this film.  Just a rehash of previous films. There is only one reason to buy this film.  It's the pool side scene with Katherine and her dad.  All other scenes are drivel.  So if you want those 15 seconds of her in a thong bikini, buy this DVD used. Leni was the best film maker from 1934 to the end of World War 2.  As she said, ""I taught the Nazis how to walk.""  She was the best propagandist that has ever lived.  Too bad she wasn't on our side.  She would have had Roosevelt out of his wheelchair and dancing a gig after we landed at Normandy. The only thing that recommended this film when it was first released was that it was as near XXX you could get for a mainstream film with top actors.  It does not hold up to the test of time.  Terrible script, terrible acting.  Rent it if you must for Helen Mirren topless. This is a film based upon a cartoon.  Have fun with it.  I bought it and watch it at least once per year.  Side note: After this film, Naomi Watts' career took off.  Lori Petty has been in and out of rehab and her career tanked (no pun).  Watch them both have fun with this film. Of course this film doesn't rank with The Day The Earth Stood Still, but it is okay.  But only okay for a nostalgia trip back to the 50s -- and you need popcorn and a rainy day to watch this film.  Buy used, and not over $5.00 This film is not good, it's not great, it is ""interesting"".  Buy it as inexpensively as you can.  It has multi-plots.  Some hold your attention, others do not.  Ah but, the best scene is: The Julianne Moore ironing scene.  Yeah.  Double yeah. Put your DVD player on slow-mo. This film stands the test of time.  With our military still in Germany, the plot could happen today.  And Christine Kaufmann looks great and plays her role to perfection.  Visit her website -- she has improved with age. Buy this DVD.  The film only cost $300,000 to make, but is better than Coppola's Dracula at $50 million.  If you liked the low budget Let The Right One In, you will love this film. The first half of this movie you are going to blame me for having recommended it.  But then it makes a change, and entertains you.  Yeah, David Lynch does that with all of his films.  Did I mention Patricia Arquette is topless? If Madonna would have kept her mouth shut and not bragged how she was going to get the Academy Award, she would have gotten the Academy Award.  Antonio Banderas at his best.  Excellent script, excellent acting, good price. James Spader alone is worth the price of this film.  He brings a power to all of his films.  The ending is a bit of a stretch, but hang in there, the rest of the story is respectable.  Did I mention Madchen Amick was in her prime in this film, and has a killer body? This is New Orleans, or across the river, Algiers.  Dennis and Ellen really have chemistry in this film.  Good plot (with a couple of holes) and good acting.  Buy used and you won't be disappointed. Leni was the best film maker from 1934 to the end of World War 2.  As she said, ""I taught the Nazis how to walk.""  She was the best propagandist that has ever lived.  Too bad she wasn't on our side.  She would have had Roosevelt out of his wheelchair and dancing a gig after we landed at Normandy. Jack Black is a terrible actor; very limited.  Gwyneth Paltrow carries the weight (no pun intended) of this film.  It is the story that is important.  Indeed, beauty is only skin deep.  Watch the film, over and over.  There is something really important being said here. This is not a film you will keep in your DVD library.  Don't buy it (unless the price is less than a rental).  Al Pacino gives another forgetable performance.  Colin Farrell showed such promise in ""Tigerland"".  His career has been downhill since.  And then there's the convoluted plot.  I won't spoil the ending for you, but you will give a ""WTF happened?"" at the end. The writer knew Callas personally, and wrote this fiction about the last year of her life, when she had lost her ability to sing.  It is definitely written with love, and is a ""what if Maria Callas had decided to make a come-back using modern technology to dub her voice?""  If you like opera arias, by a diva in her prime, you will love this film. This film is a must for all of you Denzel fans.  Good plot, excellent casting, and good action sequences.  And the ending keeps you on the edge of your chair because Denzel is ""Out of Time"".  Buy used. Willem Dafoe took the money and ran.  Terrible script.  Really bad.  Absolutely nothing original.  The only thing that explains Dafoe being in this boring movie is $$$$.  I give it one star for the brief female nudity. With each sequel, the plot becomes weaker, the acting terrible, and production values drop.  Buy it used (not over $5) and you shouldn't be too disappointed on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  (A few Irish coffees really help.) With the exception of Tarzan & His Mate, the studio cynically cranked these movies out.  Terrible acting & plots, plus they used the same rhino scene in all the movies, and other scenes were lifted as well.  But it at the lowest price you can get. Leave your brains at the door, sit down with a glass of Hawaiian Punch, and enjoy this comedy-crime movie.  You will be rewarded with a nice little plot twist at the end.  Side Note: This movie should have put Sara Foster on the Hollywood ""A"" List -- what happened?  Beautiful with a killer body and natural comedy style, she should have been the next Meg Ryan, Sandra Bullock, etc. This is not anyone's best work.  And the story line leaves a lot to be desired.  But if you must see it, because you absolutely love one of the A List actors in it, then rent the film.  You will not see it more than once. Wild Things One is definitely the best (therefore 3 stars), and each sequel gets worse, but overall worth a rainy Saturday evening if you have nothing else to do.  Buy used and you won't be too disappointed.  And a few margaritas really helps.  (Hold the salt.) Do not buy this film if you are afraid of small dark cramped spaces underground. This movie will scare the bee-jabbers out of you.  Other than that -- it's a good thrill ride. Only DVD #1 and #3 are worth seeing.  #2 They tried to replace Kevin Bacon with some other actor and it was painful to watch the failure.  #4 Was a travel back to the wildwest and was absurd; not worth your time. Yeah, neither one of these movies is a classic, but they are guilty pleasures.  Of the two, the Red Dawn story line strains credibility the most, yet is the best acted of the two films.  Every character in Red Dawn is believable, and the ending will tear your heart out. Milla's entire career is now based upon action films.  And she has the choreography down!  The acting is just okay, and the script is just okay, but Milla brings a believable punch to her scenes that makes the film worth buying.  Very entertaining. Based upon the premise (see other reviews), I was prepared not to like even the first episode.  What a surprise!  Great characters, and great plot lines.  You are guaranteed at least two really BIG laughs in each episode.  I have ordered the second season -- can't wait! This is going to sound strange: I like this film better than I like it.  You have to see the film to understand.  Read other reviews for the plot, just trust me when I say to buy it used and you won't be disappointed. Bad history set aside, neither film was that interesting.  The acting and scripts were mediocre. At any point in either film, you could turn off the television and mow the lawn, and not miss a beat.  Top rated acting talents were wasted in both films.  Two Stars for costumes.  Watch Showtime's ""The Tudors"" instead -- bad history, but excellent acting and excellent scripts. And the winner is: Disc 1 The Final Cut  I have seen all the versions, and this one is the most powerful.  If you've never seen this film, watch The Final Cut first.  You will be glad you did.  And not enough can be said about the haunting beauty of Sean Young in her prime.  You end up wishing she was in every scene. This is a comic book movie, so leave your brains at the door.  It is filled with absurdity and illogical scenes, but who cares?  It is throughly enjoyable and you will watch it more than once.  Buy it. If you love the Three Stooges, you will love this collection.  The only problem with their act is that it is repetitive and predictable.  (Moe in the middle, Curly to his left, and Larry to his right -- now let the slapping begin.  In every film.)  The Marx Bros. were more creative and interesting. The best thing about this film is that all of the leads were in their prime and the casting was perfect.  The story is original and keeps you entertained to the last scene.  Tom nails his role.  This is a DVD you will watch at least once every 6 months. You know this is a classic and you know the plot.  But did you know that Grace Kelly went to bed with Gary Cooper during the making of this film?  According to her biographer, she had a thing for older men (Bing Crosby was next on her list).  There was a 30 year difference between her and Coop.  This fact adds a special flavor to the watching of this film -- the ""marriage"" suddenly becomes believable. And the winner is: Disc 1 The Final Cut  I have seen all the versions, and this one is the most powerful.  If you've never seen this film, watch The Final Cut first.  You will be glad you did.

This past year, David checked into a rehab facility for ""Sexual Addiction"".  Wait, he plays that character in his series!  Buy this used.  There might not be a Season Three if they don't release him. This may not be accurate English history, and the actor playing Henry VIII looks nothing like him, but this is an excellent series and worth every penny you spend.  Trust me, if historical costume dramas are your thing, you will love this series. Even if the title were changed, so as not to give away the rehashed plot, this film remains a predictable drama, with terrible acting, poor casting, no suspense or surprises, and an ending that is unbelievably bad.  The sex is poorly staged and photographed and the director is entirely to blame for this booring film.  Do not buy it, don't even rent it.  Rent Femme Fatale to see what a really good thriller is all about. This is a really good comedy, but you should rent it before buying it.  It may not be your cup of tea.  Robert Downey should have received an Academy Award for his role.  Ben Stiller, like in all of his films, is annoying. Tom Cruise pulls it off.  He is convincing as Staffenburg.  And to date, of the 5 or 6 films concerning this event, this film is the best.  Where possible, they used actual locations, even some interiors.  And the actors behaved like German officers, further giving it the feel of authenticity. I didn't like the casting of this film, I didn't like the amateur acting, and the script had too many holes in it.  So why have I watched it four times?  Yeah, it's one of those films your brain gets locked into. This is a fun film.  Good acting, good story, and good direction.  The plot twists are exceptional and the beauty and character of Marisa Tomei almost steals the film.  Note how her eyes sparkle every time she sees her ex husband. No, I am not going to ruin the film for you.  Go ahead and watch it.  The film is not shot in a straight time-line.  It continually gives you large chunks of flashbacks.  This is done to fool you with the ending.  At the end, count on your fingers the major illogical plot twists -- I counted three.  If the film was shot in proper time sequence, I think you would have said WTF about half way through it. PLOT SPOILER ALERT!  At last, finally a series that ends on a high note.  There are more laughs in this season than the past three, and better story writing.  It is a pleasant goodbye to House. Beautifully filmed, but does this film ever drag on!  You can get up, go mow the lawn, paint the garage, and take the dog for a walk, and not miss a thing.  And, with one exception, the acting is wooden, robotic, terrible.  They needed real actors, and not people hired off the street for day wages. Rent this movie, don't buy it unless you collect Don Cheadle films.  It is an enjoyable film because of Brendon Gleeson.  He carries the weight (literally) of the film.  His acting is superb.  The plot has been reviewed by others -- cops vs drug traffickers -- with interesting dialog and scenes.  Worth watching some Saturday evening with fish & chips and a Guinness. Good bio on Hunter Thompson and Johnny Depp captures his persona.  But Amber Heard steals the film when she comes out of the water next to his boat.  What a movie entrance! Very predictable movie.  The only saving grace in this film is that Steven Spielberg did not decide to change the ending from a typical Hollywood ending, to a more realistic cold German ending.  I won't spoil it for you, but you can guess the ending by looking at the cover of the DVD. Since I never heard of this film, I thought it couldn't be all that wonderful.  Trust me, all of the positive reviews are dead on.  This is a film that when you think you know what is going to happen next, the writer cleverly changes direction.  Oh yeah, this film is going to surprise you with the ending. You will smile really big, and the next evening watch it again.  It's that good. The excellent writing, character developments and plot twists compliment the first season.  There are no big surprises -- until the final episode.  Then you are left hanging because the show was cancelled. Stallone is again thrown into prison and must find a way to escape.  This time his partner is Arnold instead of Kurt Russel.  This is a film that you should rent, and not buy. With each sequel, the plot becomes weaker, the acting terrible, and production values drop.  Buy it used (not over $5) and you shouldn't be too disappointed on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  (A few Irish coffees really help.) This film is an ego trip for the director.  After the movie is over, you say ""So what?""  This is the kind of movie the French call an ""artistic masterpiece"".  That should tell you everything you need to know about this film.  Thank god I bought it used. Excellent films to help you with your beginning Italian 101.  (English subtitles.)  Excellent films for T & A. (4 stars)  Terrible films for plot and acting.  Did I mention excellent for T & A?  Buy used. Interesting Jean Reno action film, but you probably would not watch it if it had an unknown actor in the lead.  There is a big error at the end of the film, which I won't give away. It is a DVD best rented first, because I doubt you will watch it more than once.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2CW9IQAPFEYLM," A Hitchcock beauty in which Joan Fontaine gradually (and of course wrongly) comes to suspect that her husband (Cary Grant) is trying to kill her for her money. The beginning is slow and the ending a Hollywood code tack-on, but most of the movie is of great interest as the suspense builds and builds. Nigel Bruce is perfectly cast as Grant's crony, and his presence really adds to the suspense. Fontaine won an Oscar. Worth a watch. E.M. Forster's novel brought to the screen, a young woman (Maggie Smith) must decide between marrying a doltish and boring Englishman or the man who arrouses her passions. Set in Florence and England, the movie captures faithfully the period (1900-1910) of Edwardian transition in morals in England. The acting is superb and the love story told evocatively. Definitely worth a watch. A woman (Theresa Russell) marries rich guys and then poisons them; Debra Winger is sent to investigate. A real cat-and-mouse game develops between the two on Hawaii, and Winger sets up Russell perfectly--and surprisingly for the viewer. The characterization is a bit weak and fuzzy, but the story development and that terrific surprise ending (my lips are sealed) make for a neat little mystery/crime movie. Garbo plays the title character who forsakes her home and family for the love of the army officer Vronsky (played by Frederic March). It can't hold up to the book, of course, but Garbo is magnificent to watch, and Basil Rathbone as her demanding husband is simply terrific and faultless. In fact, Rathbone sticks more in the mind than March does. Definitely worth a watch. Kirk Douglas stars as Vincent Van Gogh in this excellent biography of the troubled artist. All the ""facts"" are presented: the break with his family, the help given by his brother, his living with a prostitute, meeting Gauguin (played by Anthony Quinn), the madness and suicide. Most of all, Van Gogh's pictures are here. Douglas brings a fire to the role, and the whole film is dripping with authenticity. There's no excuse for this not being on DVD yet. Steve McQueen is a rockabilly singer out on parole after serving time for knifing someone. He goes home to his wife (Lee Remick) and tries to go straight, but things go wrong and he becomes violent again. Written by Horton Foote, so you can expect good things, but it's fairly heavy going in a second-rate Tennessee Williams down-on-the-chicken-shack-low-life sort of way. Both Foote and McQueen did much better things than this. This is an excellent courtroom drama. Ben Gazzara is an army lieutenant accused of murdering a bartender who reportedly beat up and raped his wife (Lee Remick). James Stewart and George C. Scott are the two lawyers who battle it out in court--Stewart for the defense. Stewart shows the bartender to be a victimizer of women, all in his ""gee-whiz"" style. Fast paced and very well done. Duke Ellington wrote the music which adds greatly to the movie's sophistication. Very faithful adaptation of Saul Bellow's novel, with Robin Williams in the lead role as Tommy Wilhelm, a 40-year-old man down and out on his luck and howling at the world because of it. Williams lets out all the stops and creates a harrowing and harried character who loses all hope. A powerful picture. Set in New Orleans, Dennis Quaid is a police detective mildly on the take; Ellen Barkin is an insider sent in to investigate the corruption. While she is being prim and proper and going by the book, Quaid becomes neck deep in a murder investigation. Quaid turns out to be small potatoes compared to who the killers are. Parts are fairly predictable, but on the whole it's not a bad movie. Weird, very weird. Virgil, Texas, is celebrating its sesquicentenial, and this tells the story of some of its strangest inhabitants: the Lying Woman, the Laziest Woman, the Shopping Mall People, etc. The movie is plotless and a bit too self-conscious. Lots of music going on. Although the picture raises some interesting questions and is funny at times, it collapses in on itself by the end. Overly long (184 min.) costume piece based on Thackery's novel of the same name. Ryan O'Neal is the lead character who lets success go to his head. The settings are exquisite and faultless, but the slow-paced acting and director Kubrick's desire to keep just about everything from the book in the movie causes the film to become overindulgent, and we lose interest. Thackery's lively wit is totally absent here - a shame. A little bit of fluff of a movie about an older man (Michael Caine) who has an affair with his best friend's daughter (Michelle Johnson) while they're vacationing in Rio. Caine is interesting to watch and there is some good comic dialogue along the way, but there isn't much else to sustain it. Directed by Stanley Donen, who also directed CHARADE and THE PAJAMA GAME in better times. Charles Laughton plays the rotund monarch in a role that was highly praised. But it's lumbering and creaky, with heavy-handed theatrics, typical of the early talky era. I found watching this picture very heavy going. A Pakistani (Gordon Warnecke) in England befriends a Briton (Daniel Day-Lewis) and together, despite their racial differences, open up a laundrette. The two young men become lovers, which is kept secret from everyone else. Warnecke's father wants him to go to college, which adds to his pressures, but that is nothing compared to the racial tensions brought about by the anti-Pakistan street gangs that both boys face together. Extremely well acted with an intelligent script, despite being rather depressing. This is the second movie in a projected series based on the plays of Horton Foote. (""1918"" was the first.) This time the year is 1917, the place still rural Texas, and it's a slice-of-life look at a single family in their day-to-day trials and tribulations, which include drunkeness, insanity, and financial struggles. It can be slow at times, but like ""1918"" it's always absorbing and very realistic. Worth seeing. A coming-of-age movie about a teenage girl (Laura Dern) whose chief interest in life is getting it on with some guy. She goes parading all over town looking for likely prospects until she meets Treat Williams, who is much older. They spend a lot of time ""smooth talking"" each other seeing who will gain the upper hand. Dern gets her way and appears changed. I didn't find this movie very memorable. Dern did better work elsewhere. Gerard Depardieu is married to an unresponsive woman; thinking a lover might help cheer her up, he gets her one. When this doesn't work both men come to the conclusion that having a baby would do the trick. But this too fails. At end only a 14-year-old boy brings her out of the doldrums--and gets her pregnant. Highly improbable, but very funny. Won an Academy Award.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2TAV6XYP1UB4P," Clint Eastwood plays Bronco Billy a self styled cowboy who runs a traveling wild west show and along the way he hooks up with a spoiled heiress who joins up with Billy to escape her dull life. Sondra Locke's chracter is totally unbelivable just like the rest of this film. It does remain actually wacthable througout but it certainley not one of Clint Eastwood's best. an againg gunman(Wayne)and a Tough sherrif(Mitchum)square off against a ruthless cattle baron. Exciting shootouts throughtout lives up to its predessocr ""RIO BRAVO"" Definatly one of the Duke's all time best. Another highlight in the film is James Cann in one of his earliest performances. a great film terrific action scenes Dolph Lungren finally has the role he deserves action blended with comedy. Lungren Plays a hotshot army piolt who gets the unwanted job of following the president of the united states  everywhere carrying a black bag containg nuclear launching codes. The most  memorable scene in this film was the high speed chase cars driving off one  building to another. Sensational Entertaiment! I love this film! One of his best works eddie murphy was a comic genuis in this film aboubt two rich old men place a bet between them on whether or not heriderity or enviroment makes the man by doing so they swicth places with a yuppie(Ackroyd) and a petty street hustler(murphy) and the end results are hillalours. Original and very outlandish Murphy gives one of his best performences. Boring comedy with so much profanity that it gets boring rather quickly. Murphy plays an womanzing exec who gets a taste of his own medicene when he's being played by the woman. Eddie Murphy tries but goes nowhere with  this picture and his carrer has suffered for it. He was more his usal self  in The Disqusihed Gentelman. Dan Ackroyd & Rosie o Donnell of all people took part in this shameless film about two undercover cops who travel to some sort of exotic lsland with it's inhabinets devoted to gratifying sadomacstic sexual fantasies. Unbelivably bad comedy that will make the viewer wanna make a head start towards the exit.  This type of film will only appeal to people who have a sick and twisted personalty. When i first saw this film i could not belive that Drew Barrymore was capable of true acting talent. Most of the films she has done to this  day are about aldolescent subjects. Here she plays with more conviction being  an abused girl who falls for the wrong guy and end up on the wrong side of  the law. Some tense moments and overall a well done film.

A3B6ZXQ7VUFRB3," My uncle fought & was wounded in the Huertgen Forest.  He was with the 4th Infantry Division as a S/Sgt.  The movie showed the futility of fighting for territory in an area where territory didn't really matter.  Both sides lost men because someone higher up believed that fighting there was necessary but apparently without asking why.  If you're a WWII student then you should watch this movie. It was better the first time I saw it when it first came out.  Still has some funny lines but the Nolte cop character is a buffoon with a badge.  I hope there isn't a department that would hire him.  But it's just a movie & worth watching if you haven't seen it yet. The bad guys are bad. I couldn't buy the mother daughter relationship.  Maybe somebody younger than Meryl Streep in the role.  Had potential but didn't fulfill it in my opinion.  Not great but also not that bad. I've been an MST 3K fan from the beginning.  I'm happy to see that they're recycling scenes from past shows again.  I have several of their tapes.  They make me laugh.  And that's a good thing. Good cast & story.  I liked the interviews with two of the real Newton boys during the final credits.  I had never heard of them before.  The characters were mostly likable but still criminals never mind their rationalizations for their actions. Extremely moving account of WWII in the Pacific theatre of war.  Because of the movie I ordered all the books written by some of the main characters.  I've watched this three times now & see something new every time.  My uncle was a WWII veteran in Europe.  He often said he was glad he wasn't in the Pacific fighting even though he fought in the battles of the Hurtgen Forest & Bulge & was wounded in both. I discovered Monty Python on PBS years ago.  I thought then that they were hilarious.  They were so off the wall.  They weren't always great but were often good & rarely bad.  If you like Monty Python get this collection.  It is well worth it for the laughs. If you're like me & don't really watch movies to think then this is one for you.  A Greek legend battles bad things to redeem himself while borrowing a scene from Braveheart & other rousing movies.  It's not Greek mythology so don't use it as a basis for a school report.  I usually like movies featuring the ""Rock"".  I like this one. Very well done.  The battle scenes are spectacular.  The Chinese make excellent ""historical"" movies.  Worth seeing.  I didn't see the animated Disney version but I'm betting it wasn't nearly as spectacular. A story taken from a true event in French history during WWII.  The French in Paris helped the Nazis round up their Jewish citizens for transport to the death camps.  At least they now admit it.  Many countries in Europe have yet to do so.  I haven't read the book that this movie is based upon so I don't know how closely it follows the book. So funny I've watched it twice so far.  I'm a fan of Simon Pegg & Nick Frost.  Not so much Seth Rogan but as Paul he's much better.  You'll need to see it more than once to catch all the references to sic-fi movies. Lots of blood & gore mixed with some Greek history.  It's not real history but close enough.  Get a book or go online & read the real history of this period & you'll learn something.  The characters in the film really existed. I'm a fan of Jean Reno.  The storyline isn't original although the movie is supposed to be based on a true story.  It's one of a gangster who has retired & his former associates who won't let him retire peacefully.  There's a police detective who tries to bring order while working in a city full of corrupt officials, both political & police.  If you like revenge movies with English subtitles you should like this French language movie. This is my kind of movie.  Police working undercover with a CI to bring down bad guys.  Throws in some Fed vs Locals tension...which does exist.  I like the actors too.  Requires that you suspend judgement to buy into the story but it's just a movie after all. Excellent movie about an excellent human being who sacrificed his life for his team mates in a war that has become a sideshow to most Americans.  The longest war in American history only affects those who lost friends & loved ones while the rest wonder who will be the next Voice, reality show winner or shallow celebrity to make a fool of him/herself. Unless you've been to Israel you won't believe what a modern country it is.  A tour given by the current PM Netanyahu.  Of course it's part political PR but fascinating all the same. A story taken from a true event in French history during WWII.  The French in Paris helped the Nazis round up their Jewish citizens for transport to the death camps.  At least they now admit it.  Many countries in Europe have yet to do so.  I haven't read the book that this movie is based upon so I don't know how closely it follows the book. Good movie about the Russian (or is it Siberian) criminal code.  I don't know how accurate or true to life it is but interesting never the less.  Malkovich has the same accent he uses in other movies requiring an accent.  The tattoos are those used by the Russian ""mafia"".  Worth a look. If you loved the Jason Bourne movies then you'll love this Korean version.  The difference is that this ""Jason"" worked for North Korean & defected.  The bad guys are supposed to be the good guys.  You'll see the Bourne effect once you see the movie.  The budget for crashed vehicles must have been huge! A Vietnamese ""Western"" with elements of several Western movies & Kurosawa's films of which several Westerns versions were also made.  It takes place in a time both ancient & modern.  The main character Master Dao is kind of a ""Bladerunner"" tracking down those who leave the Emperor's army.  If you like ""Westerns"" you should like this film. This good (kind of) takes revenge over evil has been done before many times.  This time with a barely understandable English accent.  If you like this theme you'll probably enjoy this movie.  The bad guys are really bad & the good guy is only kind of bad.  I rooted for the kind of good/bad guy. I generally like Kevin Costner but not in this movie.  Oh he was okay but the whole premise of the thing was beyond absurd.  It was stupid.  The woman who played the CIA control was a cartoon character.  I know it's just a movie but the CIA is supposed to be covert not running around in Paris shooting up the place.  Costner must have had 3 days to kill & agreed to be in this MST3K reviewable movie. ""I like it"" is for the special effects.  The movie itself was too deep for my simple mind.  The poor overcome obstacles to defeat the privileged rich then the privileges they wanted are destroyed by them.  Two young children set off into the wilderness after the destruction of the train to what?  Be eaten by the polar bear? Start a new civilization in the frozen tundra? The men & women who are fighting to protect us do so because it's their jobs.  The ""Hornet's Nest"" is the name that applies to all of Afghanistan & not just one valley.  This is a movie you must see. If only we had people who do what he does without being glory hounds.  I like Denzel Washington & and the characters he plays in most of his movies.  This movie is pure fantasy but nothing wrong with a straight forward morality play of good vs. evil.  It makes you want to go to your local Home Depot or Lowe's & look at all the potential lethal tools.  See the movie then you'll understand. A story about how a drug will increase your mental powers leading to all sorts of strange events.  Shades of 2001 Space Odyssey scene with trippy special effects throughout.  You can enjoy it with only 2% of your brain. I'm a fan of Liam Neeson so I tend to like pretty much anything he's in.  He's a damaged good/kinda bad guy going up against really bad guys.  Nothing deep about this movie just good old fashion good over evil. Bad CIA guys vs good CIA guys vs Russians all who run around in foreign cities shooting each other without any intervention by local authorities.  Probably due to foreign aid.  If you like shoot'em ups then you'll like this movie but don't burden yourself with thinking during the viewing.  It'll only ruin it for you. One of Keanu Reeves better recent roles.  Pretty much a typical good/bad guy gets revenge over bad/bad guys & gal.  Not deep or a message movie about some injustice somewhere but a fast paced escapist shoot'em up. My kind of movie. I'm a fan of all the main characters in this movie.  The wallowing in self pity is almost too much.  But you discover that it might not be that too much after all.  Rather predictable storyline but the cast makes it worth watching. I'm generally a fan of Russell Crowe.  This movie is based on true events which in Hollywood means that Aussies fought at Gallipoli during WW1 & died.  Nevertheless it's a very nice story about a father who wants to bring his sons (dead or alive) home to Australia.  Gallipoli was a monumental tragedy for all who fought there. If you like vampires & comedy than you'll like these vampires trying to get by in New Zealand.  Eternal life isn't all that it's cracked up to be when sharing a flat with other vampires & trash talking werewolves.  I'm going to watch it again because I know that I've missed some lines the first time around. My spouse is half Norwegian.  Now I knew where the sense of humor comes from.  I'm a big fan of Stellan Skarsgard in English or Norwegian.  It's one of those where subtitles are helpful but not really necessary to understand what's going on. If you are able to sit through this idiotic movie consider yourself a Survivor.  Most action movies have a smidgin of plausibility but this one lacks even that.  If you must watch it make certain that it's shown for free.  It's not worth paying anything to see it. I'm a big fan of Liam Neeson & Ed Harris.  The movie story line isn't very original but fun to watch anyway.  Don't think too much about what's happening it'll only spoil the action.  Not a bad movie at all & worth seeing if you like that genre. A story about how a drug will increase your mental powers leading to all sorts of strange events.  Shades of 2001 Space Odyssey scene with trippy special effects throughout.  You can enjoy it with only 2% of your brain. I'm a big fan of Asian language martial arts movies.  This is one of the best I've seen in a long time.  Lots of martial arts action.  This movie is well done.  The stunts are excellent.  There must have been lots of bruised stunt people during the making of this film.  This is Donnie Yen's best movie yet. I'm generally a fan of Russell Crowe.  This movie is based on true events which in Hollywood means that Aussies fought at Gallipoli during WW1 & died.  Nevertheless it's a very nice story about a father who wants to bring his sons (dead or alive) home to Australia.  Gallipoli was a monumental tragedy for all who fought there. I remember the original TV series that  this movie is based upon.  This updated version has the same humor & action.  With a bigger budget of course. The characters are well chosen for their roles.  Obviously set up for potential sequels.  Might be fun if they try for at least one more while keeping the tongue in cheek humor. Well done movie of Chinese Special Forces defeating a mercenary squad of Western former Special Forces soldiers led by a former SEAL.  It's just a movie or a glimpse into the future. Would have been much  better if Hollywood didn't blame the ISIS-like carnage on Western capitalists who were building a water treatment facility in order to further exploit fourth world peoples.  That's what this movie is all about.  That and a family of exploiters attempting to flee the exploited.  They're saved when they reach Vietnam.  Vietnam the land of freedom.  Watch it for the action & try to ignore the nonsensical premise. It helps if you're from the East End of London to understand what's being said but you can following the storyline by filling in the blanks.  Tom Hardy does an excellent job of portraying both Krays.  There have been other movies made about the Krays.  This might be the best. Actually I personally gave it three stars but my wife loved it so we compromised with four stars.  A nice story about a legal immigrant from Ireland who meets a nice Italian-American boy & then a nice Irish boy. I believe that I've seen the entire Ip Man series to date.  I always enjoy watching Donnie Yen as Ip Man.  The display of martial arts is very impressive.  I wonder how many broken noses there were in the making of the film?  The Chinese view of Westerns in these movies is usually not very flattering.  Often with good reason. Fairly typical run of the mill gungho Marine movie that takes place somewhere in the Middle East a al Benghazi.  You've seen it before in a different place & time with different actors.  Wait for it to show up in Amazon Prime or Netflix before paying to see it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1YF6OX7EBBHQO," Hardcorps Action flick.  Gere is good as a jaded detective looking to get payback for his partner's death.  The final showdown is better than most.  Bassinger is good in this too and works well with Gere in my opinion.  Great escapism. Great Movie with Great Character Actors.  My favorite James Woods flick.  Simple action fare but fun and well told.  Woods makes for a great assassin with an agenda and Dennehy is believable as a cop turned writer.  Some great scenes of Woods plying his trade and he is a sympathetic character when he stands up to protect Dennehy's daughter toward the end.  One of those good movies I wanted for my personal favorites collection. Great Action/Comedy with Arkin and Caan doing some of their best work.  The fight scene in the mens room between Caan and the cross dresser is still awesome.  Some of the best lines in this type of film.  ""I can't shoot for s*** today!""...""Well don't feel too bad you hit a nurse!"" Priceless!  I remember seeing it in the theater.  In the vernacular.....They don't make 'em like that anymore!! Robert Culp did some of his best work on this film in my opinion.  Raquel Welch carried it off well too.  The revenge western well done but everyone thought it was just a chance to ogle Raquel Welch when it actually was a good story.  Pretty rugged and violent in some parts.  A hard to find old gem that I enjoy greatly A hard to find and very enjoyable movie from the 70's crime genre.  Great Actors, Action and just damn fun to watch.  If you remember the movie or the ""tough guy"" films from the period, go ahead and watch it! Great old movie.  Fun to watch.  Armageddon with a vehicle that reminds me of the old Gi Joe Action Man Vehicle from years ago.  George Peppard manages to pull of the hard corps USAF Officer (I didn't know there were any!  Just kidding all you zoomies out there!) and Jan Michael Vincent is more hippie than Officer.  They pull it off together.  I wish Jan Michael Vincent had kept it together over the years.  He was always good. Good old school War Flick.  The Korean War has been consigned to the dust bin of recent history.  Lots of good stories there that should be revisited.  This could be redone today and should be along with others of its genre.  Those Veterans deserve to have their story told now as well. While the movie isn't Oscar material, its typical of the times and fun to watch.  More importantly, its great to see a less than well known movie from that time released.  It tells me perhaps others, like ""The Farmer"", will find their way back and become available for once. A Great old Cavalry and Indians Western.  Hard to find these treasures from my childhood.  If you like old school Westerns you will like this...and really...has James Whitmore EVER done a bad movie??? I had never seen it and had been told it was a must see.  When I saw this was going to be discontinued I took the plunge.  Its good stuff.  Not sure I'll invest in the rest yet...still watching...but I'll keep watching and decide when done. I got this as a gift for someone who wanted to train in Krav Maga but was unable to go to a studio regularly to train.  It doesn't beat training under a real instructor but its informative and supplements any existing training he has. I got this as a gift for my son who is really into all the Terminator films, with the second one being his favorite.  He always complained that my copy didn't play in our PS 3 so for the great price I got him the whole set.  Its always good to have a box set and this price its really great! The film trys to tell a story of morality and redemption around what is supposed to be an action flick.  The actors are of course good (although I can't quite buy Travolta as a Serb even though he tries hard) but I wasn't sure if the story was a condemnation of War or a celebration of the spirit of man trying to rise above his past bad acts.  Not as good as I'd hoped but ok. Good stuff!  Anderson is really engaging and comes across pretty well as a kind of ambivalent in the moral sense, Senior Detective.  Passable English accent.  Pretty gritty and not for younger kids but a really good story.  She will always be Dana Scully to me but she has gotten formidable as an actress over time. Denzel at his best.  The Punisher works at Home Depot.  Great story.  Ending makes one think a sequel is more than possible.  I hope so.  Suspend your Belief system and enjoy this. Excellent.  I'm delighted to know there is a sequel in the works.  Action is quick and detailed.  Lots of work went into the choreography in this one.  Good story.  Evil Bad Guys.  Formidable Tough Guys.  Flashy Weapons work.  Nice Escapism.  I hope the next one is half as good.  Recommended. Better than I expected.  Penn does a good job in the action realm.  Good story with, of course, an underlying moral dilemma and even a disastrous Love angle.  Good film.  Of course it paints Military Contractors as unseemly slime but hey, its a movie and we all know cinema reflects the ideology of the filmmakers of the day.  Recommended.  A good time Damn good and better than you would think being consigned to DVD mostly.  The Revenge tale done right with a better story line than most.  Well done by Travolta and supporting cast. One of the the best versions of Stephen King's work put on film.  Kudos to Franco.  I watched this over two nights with a friend and we were enthralled.  I had read the book and was anxious because as it goes, the book is always better.  Nonetheless, this was great.  If you liked the book, you should enjoy it. I enjoyed this film and its handling of knife techniques.  It led me to seek out training in Arnis and other Philippine arts.  Now I just wonder when it will be available in DVD.  Its hard to believe nobody has released it yet. I saw when i was stationed in Germany in the 80s.  Hackman is always good and while not an Oscar contender for Best Film, its a pretty good suspense flick.  Worth the watch and brings back some good memories for me.  I could have done without the family side story but thanks to Hackman, it came out pretty watchable. Dark.  Eric Roberts doesn't play into it as much as you might think.  Tries to be a top notch Psychological Thriller but misses the mark while still being entertaining.  I'm guessing we are meant to figure it all out before the end.  Not bad but I watched and passed it on to someone else.  I like these unknown B movies usually and sometimes you catch a gem.  This is worth seeing once.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3AEN6JWPGUWFM," As seeing the title, I expected a really tough action movie but it wasn't. It was a tapid action movie. Either actors are not charming enough to rule the running time and the soundtrack was old and just noisy. The chemistry between two actors are almost none. I don't know why I spent almost 10$ plus shipping cost for this DVD. i feel regret. The idea was good but the acting-especially the children actor- is so very bad. Also the transformation from the real world and the screen world is unbelievable,  It was not a good film when i first watched and it was not a good film when I watched again with the cheap bluray verison that I bought. The movie is great. One of the director's best. I've been searching for the bluray for years. The result was a disaster. The video is worse then the dvd. It's nothing closer to sharp image. I have no idea how they name it a bluray. The sound is HD all right but it cannot be forgiven because of the video quality. Do me a favor and just buy a dvd instead. I had the priate version of this movie. It was 16x9. I decided to buy this in DVD. It was 4:3. I was so dissapointed. I didn't checked clearly about the format. Now I am very sad. It's 1980's movie for christ sake. I think i watched this movie about 5 times. This movie has a high potential but the acting cannot sustain the idea. Also the story itself is kind of weak. The idea that the man(highlander) cannot age and he has to see his lover aged and let go is very melancoly and sad. But rest of the story is kind of weak.  The fight against the bad guy and all. This movie is a must be remake. I haven't seen this film in the theater so I was kind of hesitated to buy Blu-ray and ended up with buying dvd.  In factm the dvd quality is good. They might used HD telecine for sure.  The movie is very strange but very fun to watch.  It's like Nurse Betty + Roger Rabbit.  Amazing to watch even if you are not a kid. I like John woo's Hong Kong films. I have all of his movies include Hollywood movies. This was the last one I bought. Honestly I didn't liked it. Chew Yun Fat was not charm enough to be loved in this film. John woo's slow motion shot didn't really worked. It looked like some cheap movies. I hoped there were more subtitles like Korean. The image and sound were as same as DVDs. Nothing surprising. This was an ok bluray for me. The sound and picture quality was good.  The DTS HD Remastered sound was good. The picture was clear and there are no dirt or any blur at all. The black's and white's and especially red's are very great.  You all like the film so I won't talk about the film itself.  Purchase this film even if you have the dvd. I had the same title in DVD and decided to change into Bluray. It was 11$ but I made up my mind since this is my second best movie that Ridley Scott made. The picture quality seems way better then the DVD. But the sound was the same. IT's not the HD sound (Doby True HD or DTS HD). I have both Home alone 1 and 2. Both are 2 channel stereo which made me sad.  These two movies are not that old and I don't know why they released into 2 channel Dolby.  Now finlally Home alone is released again with 5.1 channel.  I am buying it!  Hope some day I can have Blu-Ray.  All time family favorite movie. I aready have Sabrina but had to buy the collection since I had no choice. I don't feel regret. It's still good price for two collection.  And good two classic collection. It is a very cute little animation. Even as an adult, I really liked it. This is not a bluckbuster movie. But it has it's own color and that color really shines. I really had a zero expectation before watching this one and was really surprised. The music was also very nice. This is not only for kids but for everyone. Well, it was great to have extended version of the legendary classic-wanna call it a classic.  But I felt a little sad knowing the fact that it's still 2 channel only.  Actually there's not many scenes that I am dying to see in 5.1 or even 6.1 channel since this is not like Star Wars, but still it's DVD. This is a very fun movie to watch. Good music and hilarious actors and no true antagonist. Ren&eacute;e Zellweger  and Liv Tyler were all really charming and all of the rest did their job well. The story is really simple but not boring at all. The music and dance really boost up the film too. Those who lived with the CDs and vinyle discs will really love this movie I want to make really really sure about the audio. The cover says the audio is 71. DTS HD channel but actually it was only 5.1 DTS HD master. So two of your speakers will only do nothing. Just to make sure if you have home theater system. It was a silly movie. I kind of liked the Sixteen candles so I watched this one which I bought some time ago. The story seems stupid and the charactors are dull. I like both actors but both did their job pretty bad. I might say it's the director's problem. Warning! This is a Korean version of th dvd and Korea is notorious cutting or putting mozaic in the certain par of the nakid body such and human hair. This movie has been cut out 5 minutes from the original version. I urge you not to buy this dvd. I found out that the exact same dvd is selling in Korea in 6$ and decided not to buy. Oh, yeah. One of my best film. One of my worst DVD I had is now going to be release again.  With 5.1 channel for the first time as well.  Hope the picture quality will be improved. Previous version, the picture quality was so so bad.  I will be the one who will buy this new title for the first time.  May be released on March 2008 Well, it was just another typical comedy. Nothing serious. Both actors are fun to watch but the story was so full of cliche that I felt like watching a re-run. But after all it's just a little comedy. Don't expect someting well done spy movie though. i don't beleive i laughed out loud once. But just a small smile maybe? That's all you can get. Even I bought the DVD, not Hi-Def, the video is vivid and bright. The audio was good.  The movie itself is one of my best epic movie.  Two thumbs up to actors and director. The movie itself is well known as a fun to watch pop corn flick. Nothing against it. But the quality of this bluray is really bad. The Video is nothing like sharp HD image at all. If you have a DVD, don't waste your money because this one is cheap. Just stuck with your old DVD. If you don't have this film in DVD, why not? Buy it. I had the VHS version of this movie. I liked this movie because Angelina was in her peak years at that time. But buying this bluday was a mistake somehow. The quality is really really bad. Even worse than DVD. What can I say. IT's cheap and I can live with it. I don't understand why this DVD is so cheap. It's one of the best movie I ordered and is something like 4 dollars. In The line of fire is evenly good Easwood's movie and is now 24.99$ God buy it. Buying it is earning money. The quality is good. Both video and audion. Win win. The story itself seems very well written but the funny wise, it was so so for me. Two main actors were very good but I wasn't laugh over tears. Usually Will was so funny in his other movies that I expected too much. Above all fun to watch killing time film. Well, this is the first blu-ray disc which is 7.1 DTS HD mastered movie I've ever seen. Since I have 7.1 channel A/V receiver and seven speakers, I was so eager to see full 7 channel movie and this happens to be the first.  The movie itself is a great one but more surprisingly, the sound was amazing !!! Let me say one more time, AMAZING!  Must have Blu-Ray disc ! First time I watched a long time ago, although I liked the director, I decided not to own it on DVD or Buday. Long time after, it is now in a huge sale. Now I bought it. Still didn't felt anything watching for the second time. There's nothing in it except the good music. Well, I don't have flat pannel widescreen TV, so am still enjoying 6.1 channel home theater with DVD player. The thing is this DVD is only 5.1 channel. I don't mean the sound is bad, but I expected something more and the sound is not enough.... which made me a little upset. I've been expecting this movie for years and finally bought it so easily.  It was good as I thought. But there's also small dissatisfations.  First, there's no bonus material at all.  Second, I can even hardly find the product company name.  Except the feature movie, everything is dissatisfaction. The movie was ok. Both actors were good. But the ending seems a little bit quickly ended. I saw this movie a long time ago and wanted to see it again so I bought the DVD. It was a smooth lovely film all right. Altough the story was too much cliche, it was ok to watch till the end. After all it's just a film for fun. I absolutely loved the director's movies. Tron Legacy and this movie. I bought both in Bluray. The difference is Oblivion, I cannot feel the excitement when I see it in a small screen. The picture quality and the sound quality are both good. They are HD all right. But something's missing. Some movies are meant to be only for the theater. I think this is one of them. I had the VHS version of this movie. I liked this movie because Angelina was in her peak years at that time. But buying this bluday was a mistake somehow. The quality is really really bad. Even worse than DVD. What can I say. IT's cheap and I can live with it. This is just a joke! It's not funny or scary. Nothing was there. I didn't liked the director before but chose this film because of other people's comments. But why not? It was a huge failure. There's only one thing I liked which is the nurse- she was charming. There is nothing good inside this movie at all. SF makeup was horrible, The story was just weak. Wow I want my monet back although the DVD was cheap. I have no HD DVD player so I had to buy DVD.  The picture is not that good knowing that it is HD telecine DVD.  The movie. I saw it at the theater and again this movie makes my heart beat. The car chase scene. And actors are incredible. The ending seems a little bit loose. I have no HD DVD player so I had to buy DVD.  The picture is not that good knowing that it is HD telecine DVD.  The movie. I saw it at the theater and again this movie makes my heart beat. The car chase scene. And actors are incredible. The ending seems a little bit loose. What a great collection. I like 3 movies out of 4 from this collection. I only hated An Awfully Big Adventure which I saw it because it was in the collection. Otherwise I would have never watched. That movie was so horrible. Other movies, although I have watched them before, I loved so much wathcing them again. This collection is a must own and I will watch them from time to time. Just so so. I should have bought from Amazon. It's way cheaper. I paid like 10$ from Korea. It was kinda boring for me. It was two series collection and now I am afraid to watch the second Titan. Will Farrel is always good in these kida movies. He is so funny and so serious(Actually that makes even funny), that makes me laugh like crazy. This DVD has two versions. Theatrical short version and Unrated long version. There are not much difference you can find. There are no shocking nudity or violence included in Unrated version, but still fun to watch both. I liked all of the movies. I only watched first one before. All four are great condition and I enjoyed every minute. They are well packed and the price is amazing. You should buy this before it's too late. It's a comic little movie. I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece. Talk about the peak moment of the film. I've seen similler situation quite a few times. But it always worked. Everyone from the film are great and lovable. Andy Garcia was ok. It's worth watching. Vincenzo Natali is a good director. He knows how to use the budget wisely. His other movie 'Cube' becomes an istant classic. Now this one, with a lot of budget, he made a pretty good monster sexual, incest movie. Good Video, audio quality. Liked it. Good price too. Well, I liked Emily Blunt. But that's all. The story is super cliche and there are nothing to enjoy really. Most of the charactors are so full of cliche and there are not even a single moment to be laugh about. As reading other people's critic, I really had an high expectation about this movie. But there really was nothing new or funny moment. I feel so bad after watching it. Three charactors are all so dull. Comparing to the DVD, there are not many content added. The film quality seems better then the DVD, but the DVD was good as well. The sound is kinda better I guess. It's an HD Sound but there's not much things to listen. It's not an action movie or a Sci Fi movie, so. The booklet seems very luxurious. Above all, half satisfied. First of all, the picture quality and the sound was very good. If you watched this movie in a theater and wanna buy still, buy the bluray. It's well transferred. But the story, I didn't liked it. I didn't liked it when I watched at the theater, I didn't liked it when I bought and watched again. I like his other movie MOON very much and a great fand of the director. But this one, na~~ Maybe I saw so many time machine movies. I didn't really liked this film. There's no amusement moments or even one surprise. They are predictable or just plain. I like Joseph really much but Bruce willis was kind of lame. Anyone could act that charactor. All in all, so so film. I like Woody very much. And personally think this movie is the funnest movie he ever made. The picture and sound quality are all very goood. HD sound and video all right. When I purchased this bluray, it was something like 16$ and something. Now it's under 10$. Quickly buy it before the price goes highter. No more Ultra violet copy please. I bought like 20 Blurays and DVDs. They all offer Ultra Violet copy. I already have that DVD and I think it is a waste. I love the film. No doubt that you should buy this at any cost. Another good actor director case. i liked the first Taken very very much. But this one, I didn't. The story seems very attempting. But the rhythem, it just didn't worked. I bought it just because it's a series and I feel like I have to have this one with the first one. Film and Sound quality are all very good. If you still like this film, buy it in bluday. I like Will very much and personally think Jay Roach is a good director who knows how to make people laught. I laughed so hard that I cried. This is one of the best comedy I watched in 2012. No more comment. Buy it and watch it when you feel gloomy. It will change your condition. It's not a Sci-Fi or Action movie so DVD is enough. And it's cheap. Too dark. Especially the ending. What is that for? I didn't liked it. Why end that way? Some said it was a beautiful ending. What's so beautiful about? This whole movie shouldn't be exposed to the audience then. It should be personnal. The film was pretty boreing when I first saw. Now it is in a huge sale, I decided to watch again. It was just the sam. I should've not bought it althought it was 5$ only. There are some good moments but the entire movies' sake, it's not a well made film, I think. The story is silly. I admit that. But the action is really near perfect. It almost reminded me of DIE HARD. Antoine Fuqua once more proved that he is a real good director. I cannot wait to see his other new film titled The Magnificent Seven. North Korean solider's pronunciation really disturbed me. They should have spoke the local pronunciation. In this movie they spoke the South Korean accent. What a fool!!! Maybe I saw so many time machine movies. I didn't really liked this film. There's no amusement moments or even one surprise. They are predictable or just plain. I like Joseph really much but Bruce willis was kind of lame. Anyone could act that charactor. All in all, so so film. When I ordered this DVD, it was like 19$. Now it's 10$. What is going on? The price shouldn't change that much! I guarantee that it will go up soon again. Grab one when it's 10$.  Anyway, the movie was hilarious and I don't feel regret purchasing it in 19$. I bought it in DVD because the Bluray price was a bit high. They only reduced the DVD price. Hope the Bluray was closer to 20$. i liked the first Taken very very much. But this one, I didn't. The story seems very attempting. But the rhythem, it just didn't worked. I bought it just because it's a series and I feel like I have to have this one with the first one. Film and Sound quality are all very good. If you still like this film, buy it in bluday. The reason Denzel stands against the bad guys is weak and he becomes a hero seems all of a sudden. Even though I am a big big fan of the director, he ain't good as Tonny Scott(MAN ON FIRE TOTALLY WORKED which can be comparable) Two movies Antoine failed that are THE EQUALIZER and TEARS OF THE SUN. TEARS,... was the worse. Well, this is the first blu-ray disc which is 7.1 DTS HD mastered movie I've ever seen. Since I have 7.1 channel A/V receiver and seven speakers, I was so eager to see full 7 channel movie and this happens to be the first.  The movie itself is a great one but more surprisingly, the sound was amazing !!! Let me say one more time, AMAZING!  Must have Blu-Ray disc !

The movie itself is a great one but more surprisingly, the sound was amazing !!! Let me say one more time, AMAZING!  Must have Blu-Ray disc ! I agree that 3D is poor. I haven't seen the UHD disc yet since TV is not arrived yet. The image is great some of the 3Ds. Some that is shown in small screen inside another screen is horrible. I have no idea why they did showed us that way. The movie is too short. Some with images dashing towards us are amazing. All in all the movie could've been way better. I was quie not pleased knowing the fact that the sound was only 5.1 channel. All of the new released bluray are 7.1 DTS or True Dolby.  The Picture is of course decent.  The movie itself was ok and you know that. What movie is the John Woo's best film? it is not A BETTER TOMORROW, A BETTER TOMORROW 2 or THE KILLER. It is BULLET IN THE HEAD. It is very real and truely well made. All the actors except the woman singer were very good, lovable. It is not a hero movie like is other movies but much more exciting. If you have seen his other films and want to experience something new, try this one. What movie is the John Woo's best film? it is not A BETTER TOMORROW, A BETTER TOMORROW 2 or THE KILLER.

If you have seen his other films and want to experience something new, try this one. Donno how innovative by the time this movie first came out but watching this movie in 2018 seems like it's a totally fake unrealistic movie to me. All the torturing scenes were fakish and I never felt anything from them. Two hours was just boring to me. They should make this film again this time really realistically. Shame on the movie. Like I said, I expected something totally different. Something extreme, something truely violent, sexual, speedy, brutal, and so on, not a Martin Scorsese early film kind of stuff. It turns out to be like a real documentary style live raw film. I won't say they were bad. They were just not my taste. I probably won't see them and put them in one corner for a long time since I saw them all 3. It's a SF film but not a Gigantic one. The story is very small. But exciting enough. I say it's an indie film. I fully injoyed and decided to buy the dvd. I ended with watching it 3 times. The charactors are all lovely. The ending seems a little dull but is ok for me. This movie is a hidden surprise. Gotta watch it if you like small but surprise indie films. This is a really inspiring movie. It's kind of preaching as well but it's not a catholic surmon movie. IT's more of a movie about belief. Believing is sometimes everything in life to win from yourself. This is that kind of movie. The guy who introduces to the whole squad is amazing. He just made my heart beat so fast. He is not handsome or vivid looking but still very powerful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A15E5DRWOTC52J," What can I say. I hadn't watched this movie in years, thought perhaps it would be dated and not what I remembered. I was wrong. All the elements of a good romantic movie were still there and I barely realized the movie was made years ago. I had never seen this movie because I did not like the television version, but I watched it as a class requirement and so glad I did. I have to remind myself that Harrison Ford is good in anything he does, and Tommy Lee Jones could read out of a phone book and I'd be mesmerized. Love the movie! An old classic I hadn't seen in years. Enjoyed it just as much the second time around. And oh, the clothing Cary Grant wore. Fabulous. They could be on the street today and be just as fashionable If you just want to lay back and not think, this is the movie for you. Will Ferrell is predictable but a laugh a minute and the story is set upt for Anchorman II, no doubt. The premise is kind of hokey, a streetwise NY flimflammer, twin to a deceased CIA agent is  summoned to save the deal his brother left behind. Anthony Hopkins can play off anyone, and the comic relief mixed with the serious agenda plays out for an hour and a half of entertainment. Well done. Based on actual events. I do wish Amazon would note when something is English subtitled though. They don't always mention this and once you start watching, it's too late for a refund. For some reason, there was no way to add subtitles and the Irish accent was so thick I couldn't understand half of what was going on so I quit watching it. Too bad because I like both actors heading up the movie. A cute movie, but a little clich in parts. Still, it's worth watching because it's based on a true story and will have you rooting for the Sapphires from the get go. Gosh, I did not know the background of the Mary Poppins story! Who would've thought that such an upbeat story was born out of the author's tragic childhood? This alone is worth watching the movie, but the acting in it is super. This film was so disjointed and hard to follow that I wanted to give up, but since McAvoy was in it, I stuck with it. Even the set designs were confusing. I'm one who likes complicated plots with quirky twists, but the director failed to pull this one off. This is a nice little coming of age movie about a girl and her family who have special gifts. I happen to like all the stars in the movie and the premise of a heritage of gifts of the spirit was a good movie to curl up to on a cold and cloudy day. This is a gritty show and not for the faint of heart, but it is so well-written and directed that one can't help but become addicted to the series. Every character in the show, even the bad guys are so well-characterized that I sometimes want to watch an episode again to see what I've missed. Well worth watching. Too disjointed. Was not warned ahead it was a paranormal. There were some lovely cinematic moments, but otherwise, it didn't have the depth it needed to make a better story. And please, who decided on that haircut for Farrell? It was distracting. Wow, I can see why Redmayne won an academy award for best actor. Sensational. The movie is so well done. Not a boring moment in what could have been a slow moving project. My favorite series ever! It's a shame I have to wait until it comes out again on Amazon since I don't have Starz, but I'm so glad Amazon will be carrying the entire series! Well done. Worth the watch. A touching story. I would've liked a bit more dialogue. The director depended on facial expressions to convey feelings and with the pace of the movie, that didn't quite work for me, but otherwise...Matthias Schoenaerts is a fine actor. The opening scene with the Russian spy calmly painting a scene of a bridge is your first inkling that this is going to be one of those more subtle moving movies. Tom Hanks is great in it. I didn't realize the movie was about Francis Gary Powers and the U2 controversy. Well done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1LGTZGH7GMUAQ," If you have not seen how gorgeous and beautiful Kim Bassinger is, you should see this movie. Gere is angry through most of the movie trying to find justice for his dead friend and colleague while Bassinger hangs on and follows where he takes her, hoping to survive.  Yes, I loved it. But then I love both of them. An old time Sci_Fi wonderful story. Two enemies face-off and become tight friends. Different from each other, they could not find common ground but in the end would. A wonderful touching and delightful movie. I love Dennis Quaid. If you are a Meg Ryan movie, you will love this oldie but goodie. Ryan plays two different characters in this sweet love story of love loss and constant love. When she switches places with an old geyser, she discovers that there is nothing to be afraid of and dying is just part of life.  Adorable! Yep! Love it. Cheesy? Maybe but I love it. I found Sting to be a wonderful Count and the making of the Bride incredible. It was true Sci-fi form. When he makes a bride for Frankenstein, she is so lovely that he decides to keep her for himself. What a great concept and what a great movie. I had so much fun watching it. Yes love it. Colin Firth just made this movie sizzle. Most productions made him Darcy insipid and a weakling. In this Firth puts his own twist and changes things where we could almost dislike him. Just love this version of Pride and Prejudice. Jennifer Ehle is the best one to play this with Firth. She is lovely, firm and direct without being overbearing or childish. She is the best Elizabeth Bennet. Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root are amazing in this incredible story of love lost and found. Tradition and family keep the two lovers apart until Anne decides to put her foot down and make her own decision. I love character studies and in this book and shown in the movie, the surrounding personalities have a lot to be desired for kindness and generosity. Just love that movie. Stallone is wonderful in this movie. His middle name (which I will not tel you) makes him softer and sweeter. He protects a girl from these thugs who want to create anarchy. In his usual way, he makes the movie a great adventure and a fun ride. It has grit and tenderness. Stallone is wonderful. Loved it. Stallone is wonderful in this movie.

For a bunch of housewives, sheltered and protected, it was the adventure of a lifetime to be naked and photographed. Nothing obtuse or obscene happens but their sheltered lives makes them shy and vulnerable, making this an even better lovelier walk on the adventurous side of life.  Loved it! Mirren is wonderful as usual. One of my favorite actresses. <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Easy-Virtue/dp/B002I5GNZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Easy Virtue</a>&nbsp;Stunning performances by both Colin Firth and Jessica Biel. One of the most artistic movies of the decade. Well done! The trend of the story is easy going and Biel is easy on the eye, as is Firth. The Tango between the two in the end, is one of the sexiest and erotic performances ever. Just loved it. I could have used a few more stars for this wonderful movie. If the story does not get you, Colin Firth dazzled me with his handsome face and strong presence. His character was just stunning and the love of his life, just as beautiful. I fell in love.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A3U89SLWUOEI7O," Great flick.  The acting is superb and the last 10 minutes of action is worth the wait.  I've seen it 4 times and will no doubt see it again in a year or two.  Can't believe it was made in 1992! This movie is a real classic; but if it hadn't been for the memorable scenes in the cornfield and Mt. Rushmore, I would have only given it two stars.  Still with the all star cast and the Great Alfred Hitchcock directing, how can you go wrong.  It just seemed a bit dated, especially the sound track. Even though made 36 years ago, it seemed spot on in describing the sheer incompetence of our leadership in Washington and, to a lesser degree, in Hawaii for this tragedy.  Well made and acted. Russo's classic book was followed by a classic movie with a first class cast.  I have read the follow up book (10 years later) and enjoyed the lineup of upstate losers.  Well written and great reading if you have patience.... One of my favorite movies of all time.  David Lean was a master at putting together casts, sound tracks and cinematography. The only negatives are the length and Strelnikov getting off.  Superb cast and scenery. Usually enjoy films with Ben Stiller; but this one was disappointing.  His character needed a psychologist's intervention and the story was slow to unfold.  Too many boring segments.  Acting was a plus. Well acted, well written and, as far as I can see, a factual account of the rescue operation.  Only negative was the price I had to pay to watch it even with my ""Prime"" membership. What started out as a well action flic degraded into a psychodrama on civilian abuses in wartime Germany.  We cut it off after 30 minutes when we could see where it was headed.  Waste of $$ This movie was very true to the book, including the tragic loss of a great American.  The acting was surprisingly good and the cinematography well done.  I gave the book five stars, and I am happy to give the movie the same rating.  God bless you Chris. One of the worst action flicks I've ever seen.  Over the top on characters and I became tired of the low frequency thumping.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  We lasted all of 15 minutes before becoming nauseated.  What a waste.

A2D97NEZJLWRIP," This is simply a great movie. I could stop there, but there is a lot to see and hear in this movie. Kim is beautiful, of course. Gere is a tough guy cop from Chicago taking chances in New Orleans. This movie shows some of the inside society in New Orleans. Be warned: this movie is not for the faint hearted. Great movie. I recommend it highly. Beautiful horse, trained red-tailed hawk and a great cast, they all make for a wonderful movie. Boo hiss hiss to the wicked Bishop, lol. You will enjoy seeing Matt Broderick as a small, skinny boy, too. One of my favorite Patrick movies. He is so buff, and lean & mean. He plays a ""cooler"", or the guy who controls the bouncers - and he get personally involved, too. Kelly Lynch is a hot doctor, and Sam Elliott round out a strong cast of the good guys. Definitely will watch this time and again. Whew! Action! An oldie but goodie. Great entertainment and solid story line. Richard Gere steps up to the plate and marries, the Midshipman groupie, Debra Winger. Lou Gosset, Jr. Is great, as usual. This is a very good movie, with the stars listed and a hundred real indians from the rainforrest. The story has a strong message: the destruction of the rainforrest is more important than finding a cure for cancer. Powerful. Good energy. I do hope you will try to view this movie. Maybe you can help Sean find some of his errant golf balls? I found this relatively unknown movie a few years ago. I didn't even know who Sharon Stone was. I guess she had not ""made it"" yet. This is a great movie for my two cents. It is pure suspense about two generations of romance. This is a good John Wayne western movie. I was sorry to see Sam killed, but happy the killer got his due later in the movie. I do believe most John Wayne fans will enjoy this oldie but goodie. This is a rich/poor, good/evil classic with an incredible cast of great actors. All acction, very little romance in this cowboy shoot-em-up. Eli Wallach play a great ""bad guy"" in this one. Good fun. I recommend it. This movie had previously escaped me. Most of it is really good, but I did not like the ending: the bad guy prevails. I enjoyed seeing how Bronson raised and trained horses. I recommend it for Bronson fans. I still love "" Chato's Land""  better for this kind of western movie. Update to the review below: Amazon has changed screen size and shows a slightly different version (for instance Gilbert doesn't rub a cigar in Arnold's mouth), but video is better. The video quality is very poor. I did enjoy the movie because of its lineage and my memories from my youth of this movie. If you are a collector of old movies, you might wasn to add it to your library. I am happy to have it. I am very happy to have this DVD in my collection of movies. Many of the scenes in the movie are places tourists do not normally visit, so it expands the experience of New Orleans. There is one erotic scene that is absolutely hilarious, as well as sensual. There is good music, too. I also own the sound track for this movie. I recommend it. Lots of pineapple humor and Hawaiian scenery in old Kauai, dealing with a shanghaied cowboy being rescues and rescuing a Haole family by teaching the how to run and sell cattle. Lots of fun. We have purchased the entire series of Bernard Cornwells DVD movies. They are really a wonderful collection. This one does not belong to any set or series, and is the penultimate episode chronologically of the Napoleonic war. It is possibly the best of the lot. I really enjoyed it. Ahh, it is so nice to have these four classics in my DVD libray. Rio Bravo and Fort Apache are two of my favorites. Searchers is good, but not the best of the Duke;s Westerns. I am always sad to watch The Cowboys, since it is only one of the two or three movies in which our Hero gets killed. This is a great set at a great price. Yes, keep these coming. I wish they were all free with Prime, but I am grateful for the ones provided. The chief is put on suspension in this episode. I am waiting for the next. I just know he will be reinstated. This is a great value for a Dirty Harry four pack. Each movie is very different from the other and action is the word for all of them. I will buy more if they are produced. This is a fresh look at Sherlock more in modern times. It is interesting to see a new and young Sherlock and Watson. The young Sherlock has more modern, scientific methods to assist him than in the original series. His relationship with Dr. Watson is also quite different. See it for yourself. I think you will enjoy the change. Three good Westerns featuring some great actors and actresses. I particularly enjoyed ""Chato's Land"", with Charles Bronson as the avenging Indian on a dozen settlers who raped his wife and killed his kin. Four of Jimmie Stewart's best westerns in one DVD case, and at such a bargain price. I highly recommend anyone who collects and has a DVD library to include this set. John Wayne with Katherine Hepburn, then with Kirk Douglas, then with Marlene Dietrich, then with Betty Field. This is a superb combination of good-old John Wayne movies. He is always the best. Recommended. Chato's Land has been cleaned up a bit. Chato's wife is wrapped in a blanket to hide the quick glimpses of nudity in the original. I liked Duel at Diable, but the Ride Back should be rated a ""B"" movie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1H7X2DPAQYKJA," Excellent movie and fabulous portrayal of Charlie Chaplin by Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance.  He is a most talented actor especially portraying Chaplin.  It's almost as if you are watching Chaplin himself. This was the older version of The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone.  I prefer the newer one with Helen Mirren and Oliver Martinez.  The story line was better and the acting was better. This was just an okay movie.  It's an old movie and keeps you in suspense as to what is going to happen as the ship is sinking.  Another story of the ship's captain not wanting to face that his ship was going down instead of worrying about the lives of his passengers. I loved this movie!  It keeps you in suspense the whole duration of the movie.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Peter Gallagher gave a powerful performance and of course it was directed by the same director of ""Fatal Attraction"" and that should say it all. This was a followup on the movie ""Terms of Endearment"".  It continues on in the future and if you liked ""Terms of Endearment""  you will enjoy The Evening Star.  Good strong performances by Shirley McClaine. This is an excellent movie.  It's an old movie but has a great storyline.  It's about a woman who was forgotten in love and the vendetta she carries through the movie.  Excellent performance on all parts. Always an excellent performance by Meryl Streep in any movie.  This is a true story that happened in Australia years back to which Dingo Dogs killed her baby, however she is accused of murder.  It's a good film and the outcome is a good one. It was entertaining but really not as funny as I was told it would be.  Because I'm a dog lover and watch dog shows I thought it would be more interesting. Any film with Hugh Grant is usually good.  I find the story entertaining and has it's sad moments in it also.  Grant plays the Prime Minister of England.  I thought the film was good and I liked it. This was a strange and different movie, however it's about a woman who has a disorder of self distruction and very disturbed.  James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal gave excellent performances in this movie. This was a very good movie.  I would recommend it to women especially, because I think it's more of a chick flick.  It's a story of love, betrayal and heartbreak.  Sometimes we believe in our spouses and they are not the men we thought they were. I did enjoy this movie but not as much as the first movie ""The Cutting Edge"".  It was a good movie because I do enjoy figure skating very much, however, could not give it 5 stars, I did enjoy this movie but not as much as the first movie ""The Cutting Edge"".  It was a good movie because I do enjoy figure skating very much, however, could not give it 5 stars, This story was compelling with Richard Gere, Diane Lane, and Olivier Martinez.  All three were excellent in this film.  A story which could happen to anyone.  It can only take a second for an attraction to begin. This movie happens to be based on a true story and I enjoyed the actors who played the parts.  I think that women would mostly enjoy this film.  I like movies that are true. This movie was excellent and exciting to watch.  I loved everything about it and Di Caprio made a wonderful Gatsby.  It's a must see movie.  I loved the first one with Robert Redford, however, this one was more intense. This was a very enjoyable movie about an older couple with the wife, Meryl Streep and her carmudgeon husband, cranky Tommy Lee Jones who has become comfortable  and almost mechanical in his own little world  The wife wants love and affection and decides to  go to a sex therapist played by Steve Carell.  The husband rebels in every aspect.  I would say this movie makes you laugh, cry and surprise you at the end. This movie was very interesting because of all that Hitchcock went through to make the movie ""Pycho"", since no movie production wanted to handle it back in 1960 because it was too horrifying, he had to mortgage his estate to make the movie.  Good storyline and excellent performance by Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren. This movie was very entertaining and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Being an older pianist and opera singer, I really could feel the empathy for the players.  They all did a wonderful job portraying their roles. This was an excellent movie about Alfred Hitchcock during the making of ""The Birds"" and his very strange attraction, or I should say his obcession over Tippi Hedron and all that she had to go through to deal with him.  He forced her into making the movie ""Marnie"" and after that she never worked with him again.  Toby Jones gives a wonderful portrayal of Hitchcock.  Would not miss this movie. This was a good movie because Cate Blanchett's acting was excellent, otherwise, in places it was a little hard to keep on top of everything because it kept going back and forth.  I believe she is an Oscar nominee for her role in this movie. Excellent movie!  People can say what they want, but one has to read the Trilogy because it turns into a beautiful love story.  Jamie Dornan is fantastic in looks and in his acting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A27IM95K2U31OU," Everyone was Super in this movie! Can't say much has changed in the Health Care system unless someone has a Caring family member or friend to make sure they are OK I am so sorry to see such a beautiful talented woman die so young. Twenty words, It is a movie, not an award winning movie, but a way to remember both Whintey & Kevin young & beautiful. The story & Actors are wonderful. I watched this when it came out on VHS. Broke My Heart! I can't say more than that. You have to watch it to understand what I mean It was hard to watch a Mother who lived the life as a hooker take pride in the deflowering of her 12 yr old daughter for money. There was an actual party for this occasion. I guess if that's the life you are living back in the day, it was ok to past the life style to your child. To me, I would only want more for my child. This was a Great Movie! Wonderful Acting & Story! Not too sure why buying the DVD is sooo expensive here or anywhere? I looked over $40.00 elsewhere & so much more here? I rented it here for $2.99. This is too good not to buy the DVD. I am not so smart to buy & download, upload or want to even go there! I never had Tina Turner's talent, but I lived her life & pain. This film brings back so much of my abuse from the hands of an older man. It has been over 35 yrs now & I still have dreams of him & his abuse. I was @ the show in the last scene in the movie 1985, she shined like a diamond. Shipping was great. The movie was good for it's time. I loved seeing Sean & Chris Penn together. All of the cast did a great job being so young. Glad I have it for my DVD collection. This is the Best Saga Ever! I read this book @ 12 yrs old in NY NY, went to the movies for a double feature, Lady Sings the Blues & The Godfather, ratings didn't mean crap @ that time. I spent 6 hours in the movies, & it was WONDERFUL! I purched DVD after she passed. She had such a voice & look. For what I understand now the ""look"" was all agents. But her sound was AMAZING! I was so very sad when she passed as Michael. If you can find Oprah's last interview with Whitney, please watch it. She tried, but failed in her sobriety, but lost. Everyone was Super in this movie! Can't say much has changed in the Health Care system unless someone has a Caring family member or friend to make sure they are OK This is such a wonderful film about the 2 most greatest fighters ever to walk the Earth! Why on Earth would anyone schedule this fight in such a Hot place I could not imagine. These men could have died living up to what they were asked to. Bravo to both Joe (R.I.P) & Ali. Movie is very good! I purchased it right after he passed. He was as wonderful as ever!  Wish he was here. I will go to the movies to see Enough Said opening on 9/30/13. RIP I bought this for my Dad atfer we saw in the theater, & it a great movie! I did not watch it on Amizon.com. Could have, but was looking for a different move. I think anyone who is an Eastie would like it! I guess I didn't get the warm fuzzy feeling about this movie. I was really looking forward to seeing it. It was sweet & a bit weird. I think it was supposed to be artist, For that I give it 1 thumb up Very different type of film. I liked how Nichole Kidman went in such a dark way in the movie, but it was shocking & a bit over the top when it came to the jail visit, & I am not a prood. If you have a taste for the different & wacth you movies without kids around you might like it. I didn't think I'd like this film when it was advertized on TV. Didn't like the idea of such a disabled man having sex. But after buying & watching the film I was touched. Great acting & story. Glad I bought it. This horse was a wonderful Champ. It broke all of us animal lover's hearts when he passed. HBO did a much more indepth documentary. Much more on trying to save him. Much more on the people behind the horse. Much more moving of a film. But I am happy to own it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2N1MWCIAHKBHN," Newman is able to actually solve crimes without expert hi-tech expert sub atomic exploration and swat tactics. No drones ease dropping and illegal snooping. Back when innocent individuals privacy was considered important. One of the longest movies ever made, but holds your interest and attention all the way. Star studded casting, wonderful direction and camera work, the last of James Deans movies, Elizabeth Taylor as a teenage girl, always beautiful. Maybe the best movie of the epic story ever made. Factual and new film making abilities make it even more you are there. Had to buy it to keep, periodic showings reveal things missed before, a great work and entertaining to all ages. Hemingway's story of a simpler life, a old man regains the lost respect of his younger peers in this story of heart warming performance ably done by a master of his craft. One of the longest movies ever made, but holds your interest and attention all the way. Star studded casting, wonderful direction and camera work, the last of James Deans movies, Elizabeth Taylor as a teenage girl, always beautiful. It has it all, a good story, excellent acting, good script that is funny without canned laughter, done by real talent, a believeable accounting with irony. As a bonus, Ms. Tilly in knock out form, WOW! The heart break and loss from a womans point of view,abused by the court system, robbed of her hard earned home and possessons to a new and very different life in a strange country and different culture. Ms. Lanes best effort in an attention holding and often surprising, recovery. Beautiful scenery and superior directing make this one of movie lands best kept secrets. A really good movie that deserves watching again again and again. A minimum amount of words is an un-neccessary aggravation trying to post feedback, I've found most people don't need to read a novel, short , quick and to the point without wasting my and their time. So knock it off Amazon! Not much story, just racing information. Racing boats are striped to lighten, have little in common with cruising boats. My appreciation of sailing is more inclined to enjoying the trip and seeing the points of interest along the way, not so much an all out rush to get to point B.

A2J1NSFD0X1UPE," I love everything about this movie, William Atherton is so handsome and a great actor sadly William Atherton never became a huge star.  Oh well, yes this movie is long but it never drags.  This movie got mixed reviews, and Karen Black didn't have a happy time doing this movie. This is one of John Bormans best.  I love Sean Conrey's outfits.  Thoughout the whole flim I was look at his outfit.  I love the house it was shot in.  It is also nice to see Sean Conrey gets to makes out with a lot of diffrent women. That is how I feel I am not good at wirting reviews sorry. I really enjoyed this movie, because it's not for the mainstream audience. I watched this before September 11, I loved it and it's a feel good movie. I don't want to write to much about Brewster McCloud. It's a odd movie. This movie dosne't make any sense.  Twist and turns run rampant thoughout the whole movie.  I adore films like this that don't make rym or reason.  I love the ending, the really creep dr that is talking about his obession with Holly I think thats her name.  Yeas ago I brought this I never watched the god dam thing.  They plays over and over agian on Showtime.  The bonus about this is you sexy white man without his shirt. Cathrine Cooksons movies are the same someone falls in love someone gets killed.  So its the same thing but, I still watch noneless.  Theres some postive about her movies.  Life is still good no matter watch.  People from the workeing class can go on to better things.  If you love British peroid movies.  You'll to love this.  Tilly Totter is my personal faveiote. I just rented this movie because I am getting intrested in David Caruso. I just watched ""The Kiss of Death"". I love watching ""Jade"". It had many tiwsts and turns. Its very stlyish and very suspenseful. I loved every minute of it. I will recomend this movie to many people. Sadley the sex wasn't good. Sadley David Caruso didn't have sex. OH WELL! I just rented this movie because I am getting intrested in David Caruso.

Woman in Love is a good movie for some, I only like the part with Alan Bates walking naked in the woods.  I will watch the love seance with Alan Bates over and over.  I rented it from Gulfgate libary many times. Being a Gary Oldman fan helps to watch this, that is the icing on the cake.  Gary plays a lawyer he's not a good one because he helped a madman ecscape Justice.  During the movie Gary begins to, well I can't say no more just see it and find out. This movie is around 13 years and there's still a lot of hype about it.  So I wanted to do watch for myself.  This movie is horrible and the acting is so bad.  Tommy Wiseau is a really crappie actor Leo and Kate are it it again, they both light up the screen.  The sexual chemistry is unreal.  I often scracth my head wondering, the accomplished actor, Micheal Shannon isn't getting better roles.  Micheal Shannon isn't a CRAP actor he only has like 15 mins in Revolutionary Road?  I think he looks creepy, when in real life he's a swell guy. Leo and Kate are it it again, they both light up the screen.  The sexual chemistry is unreal.

Its filmed in a beautiful part in England and added is good music and just a very good movie. Plus you see willys the end. I watched this movie its a grindhouse movie. I love those.  SS Experiment is hot, I would of liked it better if it was just naked guys too. I think most straight men will love love this movie because of the gay women making out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2TA5Q3W87GP78," I actually watched this a couple years ago.. I LOVED IT.. Too bad prices are getting high-not gonna be able to watch these again. :(/////// 05/13/2017 watched again..prime no cost..loved it.. I saw my negative review from before, It had to be an error. I love this movie. a little slow moving , wish we got to see the 'creature' or 'bad man' ..... I love the story line , but the static,twirling camera,dark shadows,almost made me sick to my stomach. this kind of 'horror effects' are old school, I'd like to see this with the newer special effects. give us some light - so we can SEE the movie.and We all want to see the 'creature,spirit, devil-demon-what ever.let us enjoy this movie. I actually watched this a couple years ago.. I LOVED IT.. Too bad prices are getting high-not gonna be able to watch these again. :(/////// 05/13/2017 watched again..prime no cost..loved it.. it was a good movie,,definitely not a horror...somebody thinks it is..I do have to say the ghost thing was the best thing about the movie..Horror movies don't have to have a killer..just ghosts,house,family,demons,a big fight between good and evil..  and that is all..no gore , no one is afraid of man anymore..its the supernatural stuff. :) the plot was soo sad , the supernatural parts really were not scary. The acting was good..and the lighting was terrific,I got to see everything..I love it when movies realize 'scary' can be done in dim light . not pitchblack.. wonderful movie , a different kind of horror. I love it...How ever The nun wasn't really scary..I was hoping that this movie was kind of a run off from one of the ""Ed and Lorraine Warren'"" movie. b- movie , I loved the lighting that was done, actually got to watch this entire movie. The actors dialogue was terrible , I'm glad we actually got to see 'the bad guy' there were many jumps and scares. Id say go ahead and watch it.  :) the preview told me not to bother watching..Im glad I did, I did forward to about 20min and found a good place to start-it wasn't to bad. the storyline ,the actors , the way this movie was put together , was pretty good. cant wait to see more. the older building haunt are old.. keep it more ' residential.' It was horrible , I was hoping maybe it was a demon problem with his daughter..(throwing up black tar stuff) is a sign of possession. anyway it lost me at oil. in the first 10 min, I reconized  the red head , she does alot of horror movies.somehow you'd expect her to get better at acting-  nope. other wise this movie was 3 star..the twist in the last 20-30min, was very confusing.but I like the plot.. I hate it when part 2 doesn't follow part 1. It was a good movie to watch, I suggest keeping this on the back burner, til you have nothing else to watch..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3SOV9HFM5H9T1," There is a profession with the atavism of degeneracy that could take your internal organs with a plot gimmick of doing what you want until death is the final release from restrictions due to metabolic disorder, I can appreciate incredibly funny people being on top of things so the rest of the world seems as clueless as it usually is, but when I watched Wag the Dog this morning, Anne Heche captured everything I am supposed to feel about little girls, but I just don't feel that way anymore. When people start getting upset over a bunch of dogs because a kitten would have been just fine, my own inner feelings start to come out. I like the Henry Fonda role for illustrating how incompetent old routines become when time subtracts the essential details from simple safety procedures like boating or lighting a fire in the fireplace. Getting lost in the woods is an experience I had early in Vietnam but I did not panic being all alone in the midst of nowhere. Recognize some crap when you hear or see anything and you might not get as lost as I seem now. After being pop stars and wanting to play themselves on a TV show the Beatles needed to throw their weight around at the top of a trip with I Am the Walrus. Lately I have been studying a long history of rabble mania. This movie has a ship explosion with frantic evacuation during a fire, then the God ritual fetish on the island a boy and girl get stuck on is frightening. Near the beginning of the movie, berries on the island that, if you eat them, first you sleep, then you die, give the plot a literary suicide option. This border area picture of the Union army trying to provide for itself by taking provisions from the civilian population during the American Civil War is dramatic. The story makes some fictive personalities play their parts like you should sympathize with the folks back home and think twice about heroes. Why aren't they killing us? There was a tremendous amount of confusion for me before the film finally reached a point where doom had a deadline and the shooting became methodical. Hiding enough gunpowder to blow up a significant part of Auschwitz is a risky scheme, but the movie finally made the ashes significant in the end. The characters are all men, and the idea of discipline in war makes me wonder what happened to two men who carried a body below so that they could not spread the word to the rest of the men on the ship. Secrets are filthy compared to the way Billy asked: Don't you remember how it happened? The plot keeps flopping on flip flop and fly chicken pie as rabble chicken revolt with the help of an American circus rooster. The coop is British like a concentration camp. This movie takes all my assumptions about writers and police work and puts these themes together in a manner that coincides with disturbing psychological disorientation. Once the writer starts sucking up as much danger as he can make contact with, the plot is twisted enough to make all the confusion expected instead of surprising, but if you pay attention, you can twist in the wind right along with it. People who try to make a movie that does not follow Hollywood plot lines can turn a typical childhood into a soap opera that never ends. Americans going through this mishmash in real life turns my stomach as much as ludicrous entertainment. I liked the movie because the mystery was so much of everything all the time. The South and the Great Depression have a weird heritage that has made some great literature. Harper Lee was able to write about a kid out of place because her family had such different values from the community standards that dictate how official institutions try to control space and time. The novel To Kill a Mockingbird has tremendous drama and many aspects that writers and teachers can analyze. The idea of ""many years before"" haunts it all. I* am old enough to think the brawling humor in this movie might end with a punch in the face, but these people watching television or drinking in a small town bar are setting back reality to a level of culture sinking into nothingness. The amount of time I spend with old people reminds me of time before I graduated from high school. I did not see enough movies to see this one before, but the crowd that came to watch movies in an old theater made me feel like I am safer when I stay at home. The business aspect of the plot made me think money is the root of all surprises. I already knew all the songs, but this shows people trying to record something their own people can get from this music. Bob Dylan is much bigger than the kind of culture that most fans have been immersed in. Some of this might be too liquid for the solid thinkers who don't find it in their hearts to be forgiven. A wizard called Radagast the Brown is keeping the nest of a dirty bird under his hat in the movie The Hobbit, an Unexpected Journey. Sometimes I think certain jokes can't be printed because they are too close to the truth about an illusion that is widely accepted for social uniformity. For me the movies in this collection are the cycle that throws in a joke about marching a regiment . . .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1Q8N5LKI9E85S," If you like period films, over the top dramatic style, subtle almost too subtle humor and don't know Oscar Wilde, you may like this for $1.99. There's nothing I can point to that makes it bad (see ""Most Helpful Reviewer"" on this, he seems to know his stuff); I just kept thinking ""I'm just not that into you"" while watching it. At its worst: Boring. The crime itself was boring, and so was this movie. Wait for it to be free, definitely not worth $4. At its best: A commentary on how messed up these kids can be, with very few comments - just a few subtle scenes or lines that are poignant. 2.5 stars. Gave it a try due to a 6/10 on IMDB and fairly high Amazon ratings. It seems like the whole budget for the film was spent on the very realistic and scary crocodile scenes, of which there was not that much time. Very awkward and long beginning. Found myself fast forwarding over the poorly done/way too drawn out scenes. 2.5 stars. Gave it a try due to a 6/10 on IMDB and fairly high Amazon ratings. It seems like the whole budget for the film was spent on the very realistic and scary crocodile scenes, of which there was not that much time. Very awkward and long beginning. Found myself fast forwarding over the poorly done/way too drawn out scenes. Good idea but bad acting by Paquin and the cast - a bit cheesy and overacted + unbelievable.  Sookie's (Paquin) holier-than-thou bit with the accent makes me cringe and I want to tell her bff Terra to shut up too. I just don't see what y'all 5-star reviewers see, but I am  glad it's enjoyed by many.  I did not read the books, was disappointed by twilight, but am a fan of buffy and angel, as a reference. good acting, mediocre script, probably best for young adults. I don't know the books and don't care for the sequels. It reminded me of Nancy Drew or  Veronica Mars.  The best acting was from everyone but Heigl; the other characters were better and so it was disappointing they were not featured as much. So it was as someone else said shallow and predictable. As an adult admirer of star wars, the matrix, and harry potter, I was hoping this would be good.  I had to force myself to finish it; the acting, writing, and storyline were not nearly as good as an epic ought to be.  I think if I was a pre-teen, this would have been much better. I hope. Scared the crap out of me too.  After watching it, I feel somewhat shortchanged on one hand, that the movie didn't delve deeper into the occult rationale for the murders. On the other hand, it didn't need to to scare the bejeezus out of me. Now I have to watch maybe 10 episodes of Seinfeld to get myself feeling ok again. Lately, it seems like most movies suck.  This was refreshingly beautiful.  A great story and script based on an important novel. The acting was well done and the cinematography was excellent.  What a sleeper classic-to-be.  I bought it after renting it, so I'd recommend it as definitely rent worthy if not purchase worthy.  As a reference, my all-time favorite movie is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and the last movie I've seen that is excellent is ""Perks of Being a Wallflower."" 3.5 stars. Great story, for the most part. I do agree with reviewers that the ending was rushed, ruining the movie. For Keanu and Renee, this was meh; worth a free watch of a dollar at most. Everything that could go wrong on a space mission does. Yes, it is freaky and scary to think you may die alone drifting in space.  So there were some suspenseful moments, but overall, it was boring, predictable and seems to have won all those awards for the spectacular special fx, cinematography and acting.  In sum, it sure looked great, but it couldn't carry a conversation. I really wanted to like this.  I read the book.  Both were horribly written though I understand the story's appeal.  I think the movie really showed how poorly the book was, er, written, oh my [insert escalating sex act] and finish with [shattering].  And there is no sexual chemistry between Christian and Ana in the movie.  It's a shame because both could have been much better with refined writing. A modernized ""Beaches"" if you know it. Spoiler alert if you don't:  Female friendship like sisters when one ends up battling cancer. Powerful, poignant cinematography, beautifully done. I did not give it 5 stars because of lack of originality. Drew, Toni were great otherwise. Worth a rental, possibly a repeat watch.  I didn't read much more than the first couple lines of the synopsis, so I didn't know what to expect. And so, I liked it a lot. I was surprised multiple times and didn't realize time was passing.  Some reviewers call this a psychological thriller, and it's not. So if you're expecting a psychological thrilled, you will be disappointed. Go in blind and have a good night. Don't read any lengthy reviews or even watch the trailer. On the right day, mood, this is therapy. I got a good cry out that had been under my skin for awhile. I can't remember the last time a movie made me do that. This reminds me more of ""Beaches"" than a modern romance drama. Worthy of a purchase, worthy of at least a rental. I don't get it. This show is so highly rated and I know that the cast is stellar. Maybe I'm from a different generation, but it was like watching an overacted play - so dramatic it was ridiculous but I didn't find it funny like others did. Anyway, glad I saw if for free before it left Prime I don't get it. This show is so highly rated and I know that the cast is stellar.

A1Y3JJEBLXT7IL," Much better than I expected! Love the character development (in Shale and some of the kids), though I'm not really big on gunfights- unless they're part of The Walking Dead.  But without the fight, this flick wouldn't have been nicely tied up. I gotta say, I'm impressed. Not at all what I expected, and I love Ewan McGregor.  But I kept thinking of him as Obi-Wan, jumping into the midst of General Grievous' army and saying so nonchalantly, ""Hello there!""  Hahahaha.  I could hear a bit of Obi-Wan creeping into he Martin character, which is really just his British accent.  They made a good choice when they selected him for young ""Ben Kenobi."" I don't like a lot of romantic comedies but this one is great.  Hal, shallow as he might have been, is still a lovable character.  He just needed to fall in love with the right woman.  Good lesson here about not letting appearances deceive you. I do NOT understand all the negative reviews. I had no problem with audio, and the story kept me hooked from start to finish.  Very interesting peek into what could happen when humans experiment with cloning.  I'm not sure the second kid had a soul, but I guess that's something left to speculation.  In a nutshell, this is a very suspenseful, well-rounded movie. Although I don't believe the dead walk the earth - I do believe in God, angels, and demons- I enjoyed this movie for three reasons.  1)  Very intriguing and suspenseful. 2)  Great character development. 3) I could feel the characters' pain.  Very palpable. I'm only on episode three, so the sis my preliminary impression.  Enough of the friggin' sex scenes.  They don't add anything to the story, all they are is soft porn. I'm looking for STORY and character development.  Man, I'm SO GLAD The Walking Dead didn't land on HBO, or we might have a ton of this crap.  I would have quit in the first season. I'm no lover of gore, but this show is so riveting that, like a great book, I cannot put it down.  Rick Grimes is a classic hero with a butt-kicking punch, but he's not the only lovable character.  Daryl, Glenn, Maggie, Carol...and others who've passed on.  I love them.  Both shocking and inspiring in nature, you cannot watch and forget.  This show will stick to you. In fact, it will speak to you. These films, in many ways, are dangerous, especially for those who truly wish to reach out to the spirit world.  Not once does anyone call on the Lord in this film- and He is the only one who can truly deliver.  You do NOT need a priest for that.  Do NOT attempt to contact ""the dead,"" as only demons will respond. AWESOME!  WAY better than I expected, especially toward the end.  *Somewhat spoil-ery* >>Howard gave her the training she needed to help those in Houston...so all things work together...except for poor Emmet. :( **  That said, I love the girl who plays Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).  First saw her in Final Destination 3, and I gotta say, she knows how to make the viewer connect and feel what she's feeling.  Great actress. I would have liked this a lot better if I didn't have to fast-forward so much of it. One only needs to know Dorian's deeds and to see the EFFECTS of them, but not the actual acts (in as much detail as portrayed here).  This movie could have been so much more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2O9M056X2BK8T," I enjoyed the humor and fun that was put into this productions of A Midsummer Night's Dream.  Seeing familiar faces portraying the characters was more enjoyable to watch and it looked like they had a lot of fun acting out this familiar play. I enjoyed Mash when it was a TV series so I got enjoyment out of watching it again and seeing all the old familiar faces and antics.  It is good to relive some of those times thru reruns.  I had never seen the movie that sparked the series and was not as impressed with it as I was the series.  I am glad they took a different spin when they decided to do the series.

I had never seen the movie that sparked the series and was not as impressed with it as I was the series.  I am glad they took a different spin when they decided to do the series. I enjoyed The Duchess, staring Keira Knightley.  I have enjoyed some of her other works so I decided to watch this because she was in it.  I found it to be very good.  I think this was a good depiction of how things were during that era in England.  Thank goodness things have progressed somewhat.  I thought all the actors did a splendid job. Love Burn Notice and am a fan of all the regulars on the show.  Have not watched all the seasons yet but am looking forward to season 6 and the final season 7 in the future. I like the pre-quill to the Lord of the Rings series.  I enjoyed finding out things about the characters that I knew were coming in that series.  I am looking forward to the next film in this series. I love Burn Notice.  This was another good season and with only one to go I am dreading the ending.  Glad that I bought all 7 seasons so I can go thru them again and again.  Madilyn and Fi are my favorite characters......love those strong women rolls. I am old enough to have watched the old version of Hawaii Five-O and I was not disappointed with this new show and all it's new equipment and plots.  The characters are great and the scenes are beautiful.  Hawaii is one of the characters in this show and it certainly adds to the appeal of it  I love it.. I love the Blue Bloods series.  I don't have TV reception but my sister has been watching this show from the beginning and recommended it to me so I have bought 3 of these DVD series and am sure I will buy the rest.  This is a good family series and all the actors are very good. Even tho I am an old woman I enjoyed Finding Nemo so it only makes since that I would enjoy Finding Dory also.  The characters are cute and funny and they teach a good lesson for all ages.  Looking forward to the DVD when it comes out. Blue Bloods is a great series.  I now own 5 seasons and have enjoyed them all enough to watch them several times (even the deleted scenes)....Great cast, crew and writers in this series. My husband served in Viet Nam so we never watched this show, or any show that related to Nam, so I was a new viewer.  30 years after this series ran I have finally seen the humor as well as the moral implications of this show.  I enjoyed it very much and have gotten some insight in to why my husband was unable to watch it.  My heart goes out to all the veterans of  that and all wars. I enjoyed watching all these older musicals.  They took me back to a time in my life when things seemed simpler and if life was hard we didn't know it because everyone seemed to be going thru the same situations as you were.  Music has always been a big part of my life but unless it is a Disney movie most people probably wouldn't pay to see it at the theater anymore. I like the new version of Hawaii Five-O.  I watched to old shows and enjoyed them but the new ones are an updated version that I enjoy too.  I love the scenery and the characters are good.  I could do without quite so much bickering between Steve and Dano but other than that they are good. Even tho it was a shortened season I felt they covered a lot of things that we fans wanted answered and that it ended well.  It was a good show and I enjoyed watching it. I love NCIS and the New Orleans version did  not disappoint.  Scott Bakula has always been one of my favorite actors and he does a great job of being a New Orleans character.  I don't know how much time he spent learning about the town but he acts like he was born and raised there.  I love all the characters and look forward to many years ahead for this series. I have become a true Blue Bloods fan.  I love the characters and the situations the writers put them in.  I have been a Tom Selleck fan for a lot of years but am now a fan of the whole cast, writers and crew.  I would tell anyone who ask me that this is a great series. I watched this collection of 8 movies staring Tom Selleck.  He is such a great  actor in most everything I have seen him in.  This was a very different part for him but he plays it with such feeling.  I really enjoyed all of them. I had been looking for Shanghai Noon for some time on DVD and was glad to find both it and Shanghai Knights on the same purchase. Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson make a great comedy team in these two movies.  Each time I watch them I catch on to a new reference to an old person, place or thing. I remember watching this made for TV mini series when it came out years ago and was glad to find it on DVD to purchase.  It was just as good the second time around.  Lots of characters to love and hate.... I had never seen The Wild Bunch or McAbabe and Mrs. Miller but I knew that I wanted to add The Train Robbers and Jeremiah Johnson to my collection of old movies to watch on a rainy day. I am old enough to have watched the old version of Hawaii Five-O and I was not disappointed with this new show and all it's new equipment and plots.

I had never seen A Beautiful Mind but had heard of it and was glad that I was able to finally watch it.  I won't say it was my favorite movie but I think Russel Crow did a great job of acting in it.

Julia roberts is such an amazing actress she really played the part of a scorned woman. I loved the relationship that she had with her sister they way that she took up for her sister was so touching, loved it. This was a good movie and I just loved how the movie flowed. I found Noah's arc on itunes and initially put it on my ipod. Loved it and ended up getting season 2 then saw jumping the broom and I loved it. This was a wonderful movie and to see Noah and Wade finally end up together was amazing! Loved this so much!!! It took me a minute to really get into this movie but when Michael Ealy drops those babies out the window, I had to scream and then cry because you just can't fake that emotion, why Tyler Perry didn't get an Oscar nod I don't know, because I thought that this movie really touched me!! I've had this for about 6 months and never watched it, finally watched it and it was so funny. I thought this might not be that good but it was really good, soo funny! What friends with benefits should be about, and what happens when it turns messy! I loved it! Watched this last night and I liked it, really funny and Cameron Diaz was too funny as a teacher. When she was hitting the students in the stomach with the dodgeballs that was hilarious!! THis is a good movie that made me laugh, I'll definitely be buying this one!! This was the best movie I've seen in a long time, who knew that the world of dance was so competitive and cut throat, Natalie Portman's portral of Nina was amazing!! The part where her legs became a swan's legs I had to rewatch it again, I was amazed at this movie and I can't wait to see it again!! Twenty five stars!! amazing! I have been missing a good show since breaking bad went off the air and this has really filled my time up. I got the first season from iTunes and I have to say I love it. While I am a horror fan I am not a zombie movie fan but this show has totally renewed my interest, and I love it. All I can say is watch it and prepare to be pleasantly surprised! i have been a fan of house since the very beginning and I'm so sad that this is the final season. I am happy that i have this to add to my series and I can't wait to watch it, although this wasn't necessarily the best season it brings it all together and we see the final ride off of the series. If you're a house fan like i am add this to your collection. If I could give this 10 stars I would, to me this was the funniest movie I've seen since The Hangover, I laughed until I cried. I can't wait for this to come out, so that I can laugh some more and in my home. I love a funny movie and I have told any and everyone about this a highly recommend it! Love this movie!@ this is an amazing show. I JUST caught onto the walking dead and boy how lame am I, I have been missing so much how did that happen. I just started when season 4 got started and l love it. I know it's about zombies and fighting but this isn't cheesy at all, lots of action and gore and I love it. THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE!! I was pleasantly suprised how good this movie was, I wasn't ready for it to be so good. I can't wait for this to come to dvd. I was so blown away by all the actors that I really didn't want it to end. Although I am not a Quinton Tarentino fan I really enjoyed this movie. I was amazed that something  that could have been considered ""different"" was so enjoyable. This was a really good movie and I loved it. I was drawn into it from the very beginning and loved the message I got from it. I will definitely be adding it to my movie collection. Absolutely loved the relationship that Pi is forced to have with Richard Parker.  This in my opinion is a great family movie for the young and old. This was a really good movie, it had some weird moments but it was as good as I expected it to be. I love Alexander S from True Blood in anything and that's what drew me to this movie so it was a thrill ride from beginning to end. I wish we has a little more background on something but I like this film and would recommend it!! This was a good movie it shows a real depiction of what the life of a rogue police officer could possibily be. I was touched by the ending and it was a real action movie. I would recommend it if you want a gripping gritty tale. THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE!! I was pleasantly suprised how good this movie was, I wasn't ready for it to be so good. I can't wait for this to come to dvd. I was so blown away by all the actors that I really didn't want it to end. Although I am not a Quinton Tarentino fan I really enjoyed this movie. I was amazed that something  that could have been considered ""different"" was so enjoyable. This was such an amazing action packed movie. Channing tatum kicked some serious but in this movie all while looking soo sexy in his white tee. Jamie in his Jordans even kicked some butt, this is a great movie. I really enjoyed this one, if our president faces these kinds of things no wonder they age so quickly while in office. Amazing action packed movie definitely one for keeping and watching over and over. I am a denzel fan and I was not disappointed. This was a truly amazing film he did a wonderful job, I wouldn't have expected the ending to come like it did and he was very noble for what he did. I couldn't have done it and I don't think many people would have done what he did, this was a truly amazing piece of work. After I rented it I had to buy it. This was a good movie, although I am not good at picking out who didn't it this totally had me off guard. I was not expecting what happened to happen, the ending was very well done. ALL I can say is if you think you know you really don't know. Great movie! I loved the original and I love this remake. I think that they did a phenomenal job of remaking this into modern times. I laughed and cried just like with the original movie and if you loved the original get this one too. omg! I love this show so much! This was an unexpected surprise for me and I am loving it! Jessica LANGe is always great to watch and Angela Basssett brought it, now I can see where it all started. Yes I am so happy that I purchased this season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A19FLINPS8PLRB," I thought this movie was cute, funny & delightful. It's not a serious movie about Vampires. But more like a movie that makes fun of Vampires in a playful way. worth every penny I paid for it. If you like comedy. watch this. LOL Loved this movie of Rick Springfield's. Ladies you get to see his buns in the movie too. Rick was very young here. It was released in the 80's at the height of his career. Worth owning. This is a classic Horror movie without the blood & gore. I agree that it was scary & very good. I prefer suspense over gore. This was one of Bettie Davis's lasts movies. But it is worth seeing & worth buying. If your a movie collector. Loved this movie. Leanardo was brilliant in this film. Robert De Niro was a Bastard. The rest of the cast really didn't stand out in this film. But all in all it was a great movie. Worth Buying. I loved this movie. It's a heart warming movie. One of Leanardo Decaprio's best movies since Titanic. Johnny Depp was good too. This movie is an instant classic. Leanardo played a retarded kid. It's an Oscar worthy performance. This movie is also worth buying. Love it. Love it. Love it. Watched this movie only because Betsy Palmer was in it with Joan Crawford. Was surprised when Betsy Palmer's character Carol killed herself. It's a good movie. Glad I bought it cheap because it's not something I would watch over & over again. I loved this movie. It showed Michelle Pfeiffer really cared about her students in the film. Excellent Teachers are very hard to come by. This film had heart. A good story line & great acting. Worth Buying. I really enjoyed this movie. I liked the original Casper movie too. The cartoon back in the 70's was ok. But I thought the movies were better. Good family movie. Worth Buying. This is a really good ghost story. It's fun to watch. If you like good family ghost stories this movie is for you. Not gory & won't give your children nightmares which is always a plus in my opinion. LOL Saw this movie back in the 80's Loved it as a kid. The DVD wasn't scratched. played good. This movie was worth the $3.76 I paid for it. I love buying cheap good movies. LOL A very good movie. Worth buying. If your a Leann Rimes fan you'll want this movie simply because she's in the end of it. But a side from that it's worth watching. Saw this movie on TV years ago. It made me cry. As a sexual abuse victum myself i could So relate to it. I was never kidnapped but I was sexually abused. My heart went out to this kid Steven. This movie is excellent. worth buying. I'm going to be totally honest about this movie. I liked it as a kid. Thought originally it was a movie that made fun of Friday the 13th. But it's not. Now watching it as an adult I didn't remember it being so STUPID. I'ts a good movie for kids. But the movie brought back memories of my childhood so i bought it. I don't reccomend it for adults though. You'll think it's STUPID Too. LOL I love a good creepy Ghost story. This is just that. It's the kind you want to fix popcorn with & stay up all night watching. Excellent movie. If you love Horror. This is an instant classic horror film. I have loved this movie since I was a kid. Worth buying. Worth watching. I find Dracula's Castle fascinating. I'm not much on Vampire movies. But I like this one. There are a few I do like. The Lost Boys, Once Bitten, Salem's Lot. To name a few. Saw this movie on Tv the night it aired. Was glad they released it on DVD. I love Ghost stories, This was the first ghost story I ever saw that involved an animal. So naturally I wanted to see it. It's worth buying. A must have for any Ghost fan. LOL This movie is a must see. Not only for gay people. But parents with gay children. It's an eye opener. This is Sigourney Weaver's best role EVER i think. If she didn't win an oscar for this role she should have. This movie is based on a true story. Which I like true stories anyways. It's sad so be prepared to cry a little. But all in all a very heart warming movie. I'm not big on Vampire movies. But this remake of the original one from the 80's was very good. Colin Farrell was brilliant in it. This movie is worth buying. A must have for any Horror fan. Loved it I really like this show. It's a bit too gory for me at times. But I like the story line. I'm usually not a Zombie fan. But the cast are really good in this Tv series. I like Andrew Lincoln especially. I've only seen seasons 1-4 so far. But i'm catching up threw netflix. I really enjoyed this movie. I think all three films were good. This one with all it's musical dance numbers made it even better. Worth Buying if you collect movies like I do. Not a movie to be over looked. This final season of Charlie's Angels was good. However I wished at least that Farrah Fawcett & Kate Jackson could have returned for the final episode. It would have been a much better ending. Of course by season 5 with most of the original angels gone. The show just wasn't the same. But I must admit I always loved Cheryl Ladd too. She was so beautiful. As well as Jaclyn Smith was too. This was a good movie. I love Horror. I bought this movie for a penny on Amazon & I love getting movies cheap. Nothing pleases me more than a great bargain. I have no complaints about this movie. It was creepy & worth the popcorn & coke to watch it. Enjoy the movie. This movie surprised me. I thought the wedding was a little boring. But once the Rapture took place it was a non stop action thriller to the very end. I Loved this movie. I'm going to buy more copies for family & friends for christmas this year. I liked this movie. I'm a huge Horror fan. But my DVD had scratches on it. As a movie collector of over 700 movies. I prefer my movies not to be scratched. It wasn't worth the $8 pluss shipping I paid for it. This movie was stupid. Bad acting. Just an all around waste of my time. I never saw the first one. But now I'm glad i didn't. I wasted $5.59 buying it used. But you never know till you watch it. I like to judge movies for myself. But this one was a waste of time. I personally loved this movie. I didn't expect Teddy Sears to be the bad guy in it. I remember him from American Horror Story. Good actor & he plays the bad guy so well in this movie. Ladies if you like attractive men Teddy Sears is nice looking. He takes his shirt off too. So check this movie out. I Love this show. Season 11 was awesome. I have bought every season 1- 11. Were now in season 12. I hope for many more seasons. Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, & Misha Collins rock. I Liked this movie. I saw it years ago back in the 80's. It's nice to own it again. I had it when it was on VHS. It's a good horror movie for its time. The acting ain't bad either. Jennifer Rubin who was also in Nightmare on Elm street 3 & The Crush did a good job playing in this movie. It's a shame she hasn't done any movies lately. But I give this movie a thumbs up! I really enjoyed this Linda Blair movie from the 70's early 80's. It also stars Peter Barton who is best known for being on The Young & The Restless. & Bold & the Beautiful. He was also in Friday the 13th part 4. The Final Chapter. Yes he was a Jason Victum. Lol Love this Movie. It reminds me of the Movie ""Don't Blink"" With Brian Austin Green. They have similar story lines except in Don't Blink nobody shows back up in the end. Disappearance kept me interested until the very end. It let's u use your imagination & draw your own conclusions. I give this movie 5 stars. Good job to those that wrote, acted, & produced this movie. Loved this film. I bought it because this was Jared Padalecki's first movie he made in 1999. Of course after this he went on to play on Gilmore Girls & Supernatural. He was also in Friday the 13th (2009) Jared is a wonderful guy. I met him in (2008) While he was filming Friday the 13th. This movie, A Little Inside is worth owning. So go buy it. If your a Olivia Newton John fan. You'll love this DVD concert. It features all her best hit songs from the late 70's & early 80's. She was in her prime in this 1982 concert which was originally released on VHS. She even does a rock version to Dolly Parton's, Jolene. But you get all her best songs. Physical, Xanadu, Your the one that i want, Heart Attack, & many others. Worth Buying. I Liked this movie. I saw it years ago back in the 80's. It's nice to own it again. I had it when it was on VHS. It's a good horror movie for its time. The acting ain't bad either. Jennifer Rubin who was also in Nightmare on Elm street 3 & The Crush did a good job playing in this movie. It's a shame she hasn't done any movies lately. But I give this movie a thumbs up! A first class documentary about horror films. A must see for horror fans. It covers all the classics. From Friday the 13th, Halloween, & Nightmare on Elm street. To many more. This Movie was Donna Mills first role after leaving Knots Landing. I thought it was a good movie. But as a ""Knots"" fan I hated to see her leave the show. It's been years ago. But I'm happy to see that they released this movie on DVD. Worth buying. I wish Donna Mills would do more movies. I haven't seen her in anything in years. LOL I'm sorry but i have to say it. this movie sucked. It was very boring. Thank god i only paid a penny for it. I gave it away to somebody else. Not worth watching. I love Neve Campbell in the Scream movies. But this movie was a waste of time. But I'm sure she did this movie just for the paycheck. I bought this movie thinking it was the true story of Resurrection Mary. It turns into a slasher movie. But guess what? I wasn't disappointed. It was a really good movie. I was surprised about their direction of the movie. But I liked it. I Love Horror Movies & Ghost Stories so to me it was the best of both worlds. Buy this movie. If you like Horror or Ghost stories you'll love it. Loved this DVD. I think Hal Sparks is a fine actor. He's funny. Delightful & charming. He tells the truth about life. That's what makes him funny. He's also one of my favorite actors I would also like to see The Golden Palace released on DVD or Blu Ray. It goes with the rest of The Golden Girls series. Please Hollywood or CBS television please release it & soon. It was a good show. Loved this movie. It stars Jesse Metcalfe who was Christopher Ewing on Dallas for 3 seasons. He is a talented actor. This is worth seeing. A good clean movie for the whole family. I'm glad i bought it. Loved this Horror movie. But thought it was messed up that Danielle Harris dies in the end. Sorry for the spoiler alert. But this movie was worth buying. The DVD was New and in perfect condition. Good Job to the seller. This is a very good film. Loved it. Elizabeth Montgomery is a brilliant actress. It's too bad she's gone now. Would of loved to have seen her in more movie roles. I Liked this movie. But it didn't make any since. The acting was great. The film had great suspense. But I didn't get why the Guys dressed as pigs were terrorizing the couple. Then dropped them off in the city harmed, But alive. Why try to kill them,  If your going to let them live in the end? The movie was never explained. Nothing made since. LOL Just my opinion. Loved both movies. But I like part 1 better. If this was to ever happen. It would be terrifying. The idea that Murder was legal for one day. I'd SO hide in a vault or underground somewhere. SCARY THOUGHT. I really enjoyed this movie. Gale Harold was wonderful in it. I just hated that he died in it. But very good movie. I give it a 10. Or 2 thumbs up which ever works for you. Worth buying. A Must see!!! This movie was ok. Nothing Great. If your going to bring back Adrienne King & Amy Steel from Friday the 13th parts 1 & 2 at least give Adrienne King a speaking part & Give Adrienne & Amy some scenes together. This is the 2nd movie they've done together & in both movies they didn't have any scenes together. That's nuts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3JM8WLFO8PT4," This movie really surprised me... it showcases what can happen when a person faces a great tragedy and how it affects the pysche. Its also a great story about love and friendship. Of course Robin Williams is brilliant in this role playing a man that is mentally disturbed by his wife's murder and eventually ends up in a catatonic state. One of Julia Roberts first roles. It tells a story of 3 young women who are learning about love and trying to get out of the town of Mystic looking to better themselves rather than be stuck in the fishing town. I bought this to watch with my boyfriend who is usually into horror films but he absolutely loved this one. Both of us are Robin Williams fans and both love Frances Ford Coppola's films... This movie was filmed well and had a great humanistic story to tell. Of course Robin does such a wonderful job of showing honest and genuine emotions in this film. It brought us both back to being a 10 year old kid again! The blu ray version really highlights the beautiful scenery.  Watched it with my BF that had never seen it before. He was tearing up by the end of the movie...Great film I had avoided watching this movie in the past because of what others had said about the movie  I have to say that i was impressed with this movie once I watched it and would recommend it to anyone to watch. It was great to see George Carlin in this movie. Wonderful story about J.M Barrie the author of Peter Pan and how he befriended a widow with 4 boys who would become his inspiration for Peter Pan. I was nearly in tears at the end when the mother passed away leaving her boys in the care of her mother and Mr. Barrie...Great movie and would be added to my must watch list especially for fans of what is now a classic Peter Pan. This is one of my all time favorite movies... I am a huge Matt Dillon fan and he did a wonderful job in this role, It is a must see for a study of how racial stereotypes are in our society even still today. It is a movie that would have to be watched from beginning to end to understand the complete story. I watched this while visiting my daughter and son in law awaiting the arrival of my grandson... I enjoyed it so much that once I arrived back home I wanted to watch it again. The based on a true story movie was well written and Halle Berry was wonderful in this film... Its a must watch psychological thriller about trauma that can cause psychological disorders. wanted to see what all the hype was about over the film... It was a good movie and both Michael Douglas and Matt Damon played their roles wonderfully however, I have to say that the film just really did not impress me too much. I think it was just the way that ""Scott"" was treated toward the end of the film by Liberace and his handlers. I had been wanting to see this movie for a long time and finally ordered it... I have to say I wasn't disappointed, it added some comedy to a very serious topic. the acting was great but way over the top... there were a few great scenes but in my opinion the film was nothing but a bunch of women that kept secrets and hated each other til the very end. I practically cried throughout the entire movie as so much of what was happening I could relate to. It was especially hard watching Robin Williams in one of his last movie roles and contemplating suicide in the movie I had seen something on FB where someone mentioned this movie so I researched it and it sounded very interesting.

ALE6Q77QHL1MU," I LOVE TO  WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGAIN,  WITH SUCH A GOOD CAST AND STORY LINE, WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE,  THIS MOVIE HAS EVERYTHING.  HUMOR, DRAMA, FRIENDSHIP, FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS. AND EVERYDAY SITUATIONS ARE PORTRAYED IN THIS MOVIE, I LOVE WATCHING BIOGRAPHIC MOVIES.  THIS ONE IS NO DISAPPOINTMENT.  JESSICA LANGE IS VERY GOOD IN THE ROLE OF PATSY CLINE, AS WELL AS, ED HARRIS.  I'VE ALWAYS LIKED ED HARRIS. I LOVE ROGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN MOVIES.  HOWEVER, THIS ONE WAS NOT ONE OF MY FAVORITES.  IT SEEMED THE MUSIC WAS REPETITIVE AND THE STORY LINE WAS NOT DEVELOPED ENOUGH FOR IT'S CONCLUSION. A MUST SEE ROMANTIC MOVIE FOR BOTH WOMEN AND MEN.  MY DAD ALWAYS HAS A TEAR IN HIS EYE AT THE MOVIE'S ENDING.  THEY DON'T MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS ANYMORE.  DEBORAH KERR AND CARY GRANT AT THEIR BEST. IT WAS GREAT TO GO BACK INTO TIME TO VIEW OLD-FASHIONED VALUES AS THEY EXISTED IN HISTORY,  THE STORY-LINE IS DATED COMPARED TO TODAY'S STANDARDS BUT IT WORKS IN THIS MOVE, I love Joan Plowright.  She is a good actress who brings depth and character to any movie she is in.  The movie is good and with any other actress, I don't think it would have turned out as well. This is a story about an elderly lady and how she copes and finds happiness when her family doesn't seem to have any time for her anymore. I LOVE WATCHING OLD MOVIES BUT THIS ONE WAS TOO OLD IF ONE CAN SAY SO.  THE FILM EFFECTS WERE DATED AND TOOK AWAY FROM ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO ENJOY CLARK GABLE AND LORETTA YOUNG'S  PERFORMANCE. THIS MOVIE WAS OKAY BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF MORE DEPTH COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO IT.  MARTIN SHEEN IS GOOD IN THIS FILM BUT 'THE SONG OF BERNADETTE' THIS MOVIE IS NOT. CATHERINE BELL IS THE HEART OF THE 'GOOD WITCH' SERIES.  THE STORY LINE IS KIND OF LIKE AN UPDATED VERSION OF 'BEWITCHED' WITH MORE REALISTIC POSSIBLE HAPPENINGS OCCURRING IN THE COLLECTION. CATHERINE BELL IS THE HEART OF THE 'GOOD WITCH' SERIES.  THE STORY LINE IS KIND OF LIKE AN UPDATED VERSION OF 'BEWITCHED' WITH MORE REALISTIC POSSIBLE HAPPENINGS OCCURRING IN THE COLLECTION. I FOUND THIS MINI-SERIES VERY INTERESTING.  I GREW UP DURING THE KENNEDY YEARS SO AM INTERESTED IN ANYTHING INVOLVING THEM DURING THE 1960'S.  PLUS I WAS INTERESTED TO SEE EACH ACTOR/ACTRESS INTERPRETATIONS OF EACH PERSON THEY WERE PORTRAYING. THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THIS SERIES IS BECAUSE IT WAS ADVERTISED AS THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE MOVIE 'Y0UNG AT HEART'.  AFTER WATCHING DORIS DAY IN 'YOUNG AT HEART' MANY, MANY TIMES, THIS MOVIE SERIES FALLS SHORT. I LOVE NICHOLAS SPARKS' BOOKS.  HOWEVER, HIS MOVIES AREN'T AS GOOD AS HIS BOOKS.  MORE DEPTH AND STORYLINE IS NEEDED IN THIS MOVIE, AS CAN BE FOUND IN THE BOOK, 'THE LUCKY ONE.' I LIKE MAGGIE SMITH AND JUDITH DENCH. THEY ARE 2 GREAT BRITISH ACTRESSES.  THIS MOVIE IS VERY BRITISH IN IT'S MAKING.  HOWEVER, AFTER SEEING THIS MOVIE, I DON'T THINK I WILL WATCH THE SEQUEL. I LOVED WATCHING ALL OF THE HAZEL EPISODES. THEY WERE ENTERTAINING THE VERY FIRST TIME AROUND AND MORE SO WATCHING THEM ALL OVER AGAIN.  SITCOMS BACK THEN WERE GOOD, WHOLESOME FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT. I LOVE DORIS DAY WHICH STEMMED FROM WATCHING MOVIES SUCH AS THESE IN MY YOUTH.  I GREW UP WITH THESE TYPES OF CORNY LOVE STORIES.  HOWEVER, IN GROWING UP, I DO LOVE THE MOVIES DORIS DAY MADE LATER IN HER LIFE MUCH MORE. I loved this movie,  It's a good wholesome story about a boy and a dog who need each other and how they work together to help others.  It was good to see James Brolin again.  He was very good. I ONLY GOT TO SEE A COUPLE NIGHTS OF THIS MINI SERIES AS IT WAS SHOWN ON PBS.  IT WAS VERY GOOD, ESPECIALLY, IF ONE IS A HISTORY BUFF.  MY PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WERE A PART OF THIS TIME IN HISTORY AND I HAD HEARD ALOT ABOUT THE ROOSEVELTS.  I JUST HAD TO ORDER IT TO BE ABLE TO WATCH THE ENTIRE SERIES. I didn't get a chance to see Downton Abbey when it first  appeared on TV.  I was curious though about all the interest that ensued as it was playing.  I'm so glad I bought the entire series and watched it from beginning to end.  I hated to see it end.  It was so interesting to watch the lives between the upper crust and their servants as well as the history of time in England that this story portrays.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1X8AZTUYEXSXD," It was all I remembered it to be.  The women  were all of us at one time or another in our lives.  The question as to why she would do that to her body made sense.  But she should have not worked. I loved the animated version and this was a poor substitute.  So Johnny Depp knows how to put on Halloween costumes and have good make up job and pretend to be crazy...that has been done many times.  I wish he would go back to just being an actor.  Chocolat was my favorite of him. I saw this play on the stage before, but I liked seeing it in the film and look forward to the new movie of it coming out on Christmas Day.  I don't think I'll be whistling Stephen Sondheim's tunes anytime soon, but I really liked what the play said at the end. This is a great film.  Judith Dench and Kevin Spacey are excellent.  The starkness of the area is fascinating.  The ghost is scary and the family history is interesting.  I will watch this one again and again. GOOD THRILLER.  wISH i COULD REMEMBER IT, BUT i KNOW i LIKED IT,  I liked the twists, but for the life of me I cannot remember it.  So, I should watch it again, right? GOOD THRILLER.  wISH i COULD REMEMBER IT, BUT i KNOW i LIKED IT,  I liked the twists, but for the life of me I cannot remember it.  So, I should watch it again, right? One of the best movies ever.  I do not understand why his wife's movie won out over this, his movie at the Oscars.  I did not finish Hurt Locker; I have watched this over and over.  They both show how awful war is, but Avatar gives you some hope that love can win out.  I really want to believe that.  I have to believe it. This was a slow moving, story that didn't really get its message across whatever that was.  I felt they were just trying to elicit tears from me, but it did not do that.  It was boring.....like eating cardboard. The cinematography in this movie was great!  The twist at the end was great!  I loved this movie...it got it's message across.  I wish I would have been able to replace bad memories with animals. what a beautiful, uplifting movie.  I have watched the love of my life die too and I could relate to how he felt at first, but I could also relate to how eventually he found life enjoyable again.  It took 4 years for me. Much too  devastating.  The acting was excellent especially Myrl Streep and Julia Roberts, but the relentless abuse by the mother was too hard to watch.  I know she was abused as a child, but was there not one little softness to her?  The hot dry summer; especially August was accurately portrayed.  I never understood why anyone would want to live there. still scary after all these years; I thought it would be predictable, but they managed to put in new twists and the traveling ball was wonderful.  I did not think it could be destroyed, but the dinosaur managed it.  the sexual tension between the two main adults was great also. I liked the book better, but it was an ok film.  I felt like too much attention was given to her drug problems.  I would have liked to see more scenery pictures that were beautiful.  The dessert was not that beautiful.

A2WEYBDX5XQIDB," Cowritten directed and starring Dennis Hooper, this classic road trip movie involves two hippie motorcycle riders who pick up a boozing salesman, played by Jack Nicholson, try to know what life is  really all about. Considered the best film of 1969. Charlie McGee and her father Andy are on the run from the law, but what we do not realize is that they are mutants due to a result of experimental drugs, where they just escape from evil federal agents that plan on using them as weapons for the government. Drew Barrymore, David Keith, Martin sheen, George C. Scott, Louise Fletcher and Heather locklear star in Stephen king's sci fi horror classic.

A must see! Despite the fact the film got mixed reviews and was considered to be the worst horror remake ever made, it made money at the box office and has become a cult classic. Don't watch with the lights off! Jack Palance, a Hunter, and Martin Landau, a Vietnam war veteran, have a showdown with a deadly extraterrestrial warrior that has come to earth to hunt humans for sport in a plot similar to predator in this sci fi horror classic!

A3Q28JOU6JTOXR," This movie was very nice. However, it was heavy! Heavy in the sense of  getting right to the point of the emotional problems  Of each character. Makes you stop and think! I initially bought this this movie when it first came out on VHS. I love it so much that I had to purchased it on DVD. I could not live without having this movie in my movie library. Matter of fact, I have the VHS in my RV library and the DVD in my home library. I recommend it to anybody who wants to have a romantic evening. I saw this movie a very long time ago. It was so good that I have to buy it  For my library.  I love Anthony Quinn, too.  So it was quite easy to purchase this item. Nice movie. Sweet!  Even if you are an adult, you can't help but get into the plot and movie.  Its a feel good movie on nights where you just want to be, unwind, and forget about your day.  This movie will help you to do that.  It will bring a smile to your face. my husband and I love this movie a lot. So we purchased  it and are so happy we did. Now when we want a lighthearted kind of a movie; that has spiritual  messages we put it on. Beautiful movie. Very touching and inspiring.  if you need something heartwarming, honest, and uplifting then this is a movie for you to watch and buy. It will make you want to get up off your laurels and do something with your life. Dance with Julianne: cardio ballroom is a wonderful DVD. I would highly recommend it to others. Take it from a person who not only has cerebral palsy, but is a fitness instructor and has been dancing for six decades. I'm not too crazy about this Dvd. I'm an exercise instructor for disabled people and have been dancing for 6 decades and teaching for over 4 . I also have Cerebral Palsy. For some reason,  I really can't get into the way he present or teaches. There is something about it that just makes me want to tune out? I would not recommend this product at all. This was a good, entertaining movie because the character were so  very believable. (Emma Thomson & Tom Hanks). You really get into both of there characters thinking he is really Disney>:)  and she is miss Popins.  At first, she, makes you want her to change her attitude. It was that good!  I liked this movie immensely>:) I would recommend for peoples library's. I love this movie!  I grew up hearing The Four Seasons on the radio as a little girl and loved it then. When the stage musical came out, I saw that and then the movie.  Its very accurate and stays with the line of the musical stage show as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2490GBIRZVVJT," It is a great and funny movie about a pig behaving like a human, earned farmer's respect and gotta be treated as a main member of the family and got reprieved as a main dish. I love Roman History, the decadence, and the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. This movie actually reflected Gibbon's book with oodles of sex, murder and mayhem. A great movie to watch Rome go to dogs. Definitely not for kids or straight laced adults. A great first movie of the series. Really, really, really funny! Tim Allen was off the wall! We love Christmas movies but this one is one of the highest on my list. I love Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. They were my favorite old time funnymen, zany and off the wall! This movie is wonderful to watch during Christmas Holidays just like the Christmas Carol. A great movie with a twisted plot and an unexpected ending with a lady killer playboy, a good cop and 3 beautiful women. The picture is worth watching to see how the protagonists and antagonists switch places. I love Russell Crowe and I love gladiator movies! Also a great historic value and a lesson: you mess with a Caesar and oh boy, you're gonna to pay for it! So don't try that at home unless you have Russell's strength and fighting skills. Oh, my favorite pirate movie! I love Johnny Depp and I love Keira Knightley! This is the first of series, so my warning is: you start watching this, you'd want to watch all others in series! Pirates of the Golden Age contains four interesting old pirate movies. Swashbuckling, romances, galleon ships and cannons not to mention pirate costumes are the essence of those movies! Mr. Flynn is in one! That Darn Cat is a great movie for cat lovers. My wife is one and she enjoyed it immensely. That cat had done a better job investigating and arresting the bad guys than the FBI ever did under J. Edgar. Toy Story 3 is a great movie! I love Tom Hanks. I love Tim Allen. It is a Toys 'r Us people. You do not throw people away when they are old and worn out. Right? What a great 4-pack movie, 4 movies for a price of one! 2 American tail gems and a great 3rd mouse movie. The 4th movie gives you an idea roughly what the Walt Disney classic of Uncle Remus stories is all about. The Disney movie has not been released in DVD format in America just yet. If it does, the price will be exorbitant! Sigh! I ordered the DVD mainly for Boys' Town but found that other movies were just as wonderful! I was surprised to see that Men's Town was also included. Great value pack!!! Best of the British is the best movies made by the English people. They're top rate actors and actresses in addition to their great films at a bargain price, 10 movies for the cost of one. It's a steal, nothing can beat that! You'll enjoy them immensely!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A11E9SGWWJS3UU," Classic movie that takes a grainy, hard look at America and the rift between generations.bigotry, racism, experimental drugs and all under a psychedelic blanket of bizarre camera work, scenic views and confusion about what life is meant to be. They simply just don't make movies like this anymoreit is indeed sad. I laughed. I cried. I walked down memory lane, thinking back to the days when my own father taught me how to flyfishwhen he is gone, I will always have that treasure, in my memory, that only a father can share with his son. 5 star masterpiece, and one of the best movies, in my opinion, ever made! A mesmerizing film about the void in a childless marriage that leads to self-pity and loneliness and hatred and dying loveall drowning in a swamp of alcoholism. The viewer is never sure exactly what happenedwas the child ever really born? Did the child die at birth? Both Taylor and Burton are fantastic yet you have to wonder why they played the parts so well. Once again I am joyfully surprised by the superb performances of Jeremy Brett as Holmes and the wonderful charm of Charles Gray as Mycroft, It took some time to adjust to Burke as Dr. Watson, but he settles in nicely after some time. Fantastic period- piece sets and edgy dialogue A must-see for Sherlock Holmes fanatics like myself, and a series that will remind one of it's brilliance and it's credit to Conan Doyle! You'll love it! Slow and sloppythis movie is a sorry mark for Newman; films like the Verdict and the Sting are a better choice for Newman fans. The story was hard to follow and the acting passable at bestI don't think a 4 star rating is appropriateit's misleading. I enjoyed this first season ; It's been a while since characters in a detective series actually showed intimate character differences, and internal flaws, yet were paired in a way to make for an intense drama. I was disappointed, however, that season 2 was not a continuance of a story that felt a bit unfinishedthat said, an excellent detective dramamaybe one of the best of all time! I grew up with early rock; Love and Mercy gave me a new outlook on the ""Beach Boys""  sound and brillianceall in alla great movie; I really enjoyed the great younger/older performances.  Never a big fan of either actor, but this is a great sounding for both young and old fans! Cusack is great at every turn as elder Brian Jones. Nice period mood. Good times! Good vibrations! Amazing, deep, intriguing storya true masterpieceonce again the Brits have put American drama to shame! Unforgotten is unforgettable! The depth and emotional strength of this mystery is sad, shocking and beautifully written and directed; also it is wonderfully performed by the castdon't miss this one!!! Boring..Boring..Boring.. If you enjoy watching Matt Damon talking to himself and working around the yard for 2 hours, with a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, and bad acting and musical score.go for it. A feel good movie with so much potential, yet soured by poorly done madcap momentsstill okay; beautiful photography and some touching moments, however, the attempt at a comedic relief spoils the overall effect3 stars is all I can do... Wonderful story about love, fate and the choices we make; I enjoyed the tranquility and softness of this movie, and the music was mesmerizing. Everyone who watches this film will have a different take on it, but it well worth watching. Truly a mark of genius, a beautifully crafted black and white film illustrating the perseverance of the human spirit: melancholy, yet hopeful, this film is an artistic masterpiece! Give this one a chanceit is worth it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3QRCQ87OSJAUH," purchased for a friend and he loves it.  i didn't remember a ton about the movie but it reminded my why I don't watch this type of show any more LOL It's just on that list of ""have to"" 's at Christmas time.  Picked this one up for a friend and he's hooked too.  Blu-ray of course brings the quality up one more level on the excellence chart. What a great blessing it is to be able to have these on Amazon Prime!  TOTALLY saves me from having to chase all over the place trying to find these as rentals or even from the library.  The quality is great, our student can rewind and rewatch with ease.....LOVE IT. Oh, this movie is a good indicator as to why PG-13 came into play.  Fun show, great moments and memorable lines but there were times that we had to edit quickly for our teen daughters.....not that they couldn't handle but because we're overprotective.  :) I bought this as a gift for someone as requested but they wanted me to see it first because they ""love it so much"".  Eh, maybe they just talked it up too much but I'm not a fan of the movie.  The seller, packaging, etc were perfect. 3 days before Christmas she said ""Oh, I wish I had that You've Got Mail"".  I'm not sure what happened to my copy of it.  Like a good husband should (especially right before Christmas), I hopped on Amazon, found a great price, had it delivered on Prime and it was here Christmas Eve.  Great experience.

Great experience, solid quality of video, she was able to easily pause, rewind, etc to take the time for notes as she watched. Purchased for someone else but I got to watch it before I sent it on.  I liked it but my kids (that I thought would really like it) gave it a review of ""eh, it's alright"". It's just on that list of ""have to"" 's at Christmas time.  Picked this one up for a friend and he's hooked too.  Blu-ray of course brings the quality up one more level on the excellence chart. The message is very strong and the acting, editing, etc gets better and better with this groups efforts.  SO many of the 'Christian' films are horribly acted and painfully scripted but Courageous is enough humor (classic Snake King scene), drama and believable message that it's a good one for even the non believer to get a solid ""be a good man/father/husband"" message from it as well. Fun show overall.  Bought for a friend but I got to keep the DVD out of it from him.  Wish the kid didn't curse so I could recommend it more often. It had some good moments but they were outweighed by the ridiculous giving it two instead of three stars.  A decent message about family takes it from a one to two stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3GCF6DFG7RY29," I had no problem with this because it is (both are) great film. Really a remake of ""The Outlaw Josie Wells""  with n older Clint Eastwood. Even stole a line from Josie Wells: Eastwood kills man, young sidekick asks, 'What's it like, killing a man?"" Eastwood replies, ""you take away everything a man's got, and everything he might of had."" Still worth watching; see double feature if you have time. Missed parts of several episodes when originally broadcast. Glad I watched all episodes. Was my first experience using Amazon Instant Video through my Sony Wi-Fi Blue-ray player. Excellent. Now if Amazon and Samsung can work out their competitiveness so that I can enjoy Amazon Instant Video through my Samsung smart Wi-Fi Blu-ray player and larger HDTV. Why do I need Amazon Prime if I can only use it in one room. Saw half of movie on local PBS station sci-fi/old horror program. was so interesting, when old movie fan came by, was happy to find 'Things..' on Amazon Instant. Very insightful movie considering date filmed....even more so when you realize it's based on something H.G. Wells wrote c. 1895. Now for 'Metropolis.' I really expected something as good as ""Fargo"" considering all the hype about this movie. Enjoyed it, but probably will never watch it again, as I will watch, say, ""Fargo"" again. I really expected something as good as ""Fargo"" considering all the hype about this movie. Enjoyed it, but probably will never watch it again, as I will watch, say, ""Fargo"" again. Another good use of instant video. I'm recovering from back surgeries and am on Dracula's schedule many nights. I have watched an entire season in one setting, got a good six hours sleep with articular comedy. About half way through all seasons which I plan on watching all. ""Animal Crackers' is the two funniest movies I've ever seen, the other being ""It's a Mad, Mad World."" if you ever have the chance to see them on the big screen, do it. If you can arrange to show either in a theater, do it. In the mean time, there is Amazon.com, thankfully. Have just finished third and final season which was not intended to be final season. My advise, enjoy season 2, and ignore season 3 UNTIL they have Successfully Completed a Season 4. This is one of the best movies I've seen since buying a Wi-Fi Blu-ray player that worked.<g> Made the mistake of watching movie on a lonely holiday evening. Was so bumbed, I had to watch Best Exotic Marigold Hotel to reboot my mood, which it did...see review for Hotel. Reality based ending of 'No Country.""

I guess I've spent a small fortune catching up on the Morse episodes I had missed. I was surprised in that while I recognized the cast of episodes I had seen, I had forgotten the plot, killer, etc. It was like discovering the Dead Sea Scrolls of Morse episodes. Sad to have finished series. Wonderful movie that brought me out of bumbed out condition brought on by watching another great movie, 'No Country for Old Men.' See review for 'No Country...' Will watch again. A candidate for Best Mood Elevator. I never thought of a pre-quell for Morse as a good project, but was pleasantly pleased at the result. It fills in the gaps in the investigation of Chief Inspector Morse. BTW, much of Lewis and Hathaway is downloadable. Go for it. Will just go ahead and buy. I have the Whole Series and expected to be disappointed, but was GREATLY SURPRISED. Didn't recognize actors playing Boris and Fearless Leader for 10 minutes. Watch at all means.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1UW4R3WHWDTBP," I read the 3 part  original in Rolling Stone many years ago & was entertained. I reread the book a few decades ago as well. The movie is not nearly as good as the book. It starts with promise but spins faster & faster around the drain as the movie progresses, or maybe regresses is more fitting. Disappointing. Who is the Amazon twat who 86ed 4 of my reviews & why? There was nothing outside of your guidelines. The truth is i would like to rate the products without spending time writing repetitive screed about why. It's all been said before in other reviews. Nobody can eat 50 eggs...  This is for the 1997 release DVD. Widescreen on one side & full screen on the other. The best of both worlds. Picture is good, sound is good, Good deal. Just one damned thing after another. The movie has a hauntingly dejavu thing going on from an almost forgotten weekend in the way distant past. After a wrong head decision, all I wanted was to go home, but... Maybe we've all been there once or twice. Fragmented &, truthfully, it's painfully b-o-r-i-n-g. I wonder why it seemed so much better back in the day. Maybe the weed was really good that night... or something. The TV series was infinitely more entertaining. Glad I got it used & cheap. Tarantulas the size of Volkswagens, a snapping turtle as big as a house, dinosaurs & erect standing humanoids in the same time period, little dialog. I might enjoy it if I could stay awake 'til the end. Rated by others as one of the best movies of all time. Sorry, but I just cant get into it. Compared with current events of the last 20+ years the shock value of this one is pretty tame. A believable story, it still seems hokie & contrived to me. It may have been thought provoking when made in 1941, but today's politicians sure have this guy beat. It seems the rot goes farther back than many understand. It could have been a mediocre but believable picture with a good cast until the last 20 minutes or so. Then it became a bunch of unlikely explosions, mixed with even more unlikely equipment functions, paired with superhuman acts culminating in a stupendously unbelievable ending while remaining absolutely mediocre in every way. A good movie to watch if you want to be entertained & nothing more while dozing on a rainy afternoon. Grim Reaper or Angel of Death? Neither methinks. Vann is a serial whack-job traveling around killing people (painlessly & quickly, but dead is still dead) who aren't terribly happy with their lives. Some unexplained/explainable dead ends (question marks) make this a little better than the average thriller, if that's the right word. VHS replacement.  An added attraction on the DVD, some of the deleted scenes are great. Especially notable is the scuffle with the special co-worker in the meat packing plant which makes so much more sense when you see the whole thing. This is a long movie. It's not Das Boot long, but at over 2 hours it gets a bit tedious. Most of the fight scenes & the interminable highway chase could (should?) have been cropped without losing any of the story. The interest for the bonus disc is questionable unless you're a Matrix geek. Picture is clear, sound is good. Glad to have found an inexpensive copy. I forgot how entertaining this series really was. It appears the computers still use DOS.  The show was made 10 to 15 years before ""The Matrix""; the similarities are interesting. Max is kinda like to The Matrix what Brave new World is to 1984. Soft vs. hard control, but it's still control. Neurotic teens. White trash. Loud music. Racism. Drug & alcohol abuse. A glimpse of nude Christina Ricci. Samuel  L. ""Muthafuggin"" Jackson. Who could ask for more?  Saml. L. shouldn't give up his day job, but does a pretty decent cover of Stagger-Lee. ...imagine being born with no top on your skull.  Goofy & silly movie. A mostly mindless break from daily drudgery. Dennis Miller's role is cast & played especially well. I wonder how much funnier it could have been if they didn't stay within PG-13 guidelines. Who is the Amazon twat who 86ed 4 of my reviews & why? There was nothing outside of your guidelines.

Not as drawn out as the 2nd part, a good conclusion.  Picture & sound are good. The 2nd disc with the extra stuff is very marginally interesting. Glad to have an inexpensive copy of the movie.

Thinking this may have been the movie that I took my ex-wife to on our 1st date. Other than that it's a joy to watch once or twice a year.  Xmas is coming again & it sure beats most of the dreck on TV these days. Who is the Amazon twat who 86ed 4 of my reviews & why? There was nothing outside of your guidelines. The truth is i would like to rate the products without spending time writing repetitive screed about why. It's all been said before in other reviews. Complete & utter garbage. Insultingly juvenile one-liners. The questionable storyline is broken further by way too much nonsensical drivel. Kinda like a McDonald's burger... lots of useless filler.  Very very very very poor sequel to good 1st movie It's almost like The Archies & The Ramones performing at the same event. F/V is pubescent & lame, while RSG is much more raucous & entertaining. A few scenes have been cut slightly & the widescreen is bogus chopped up & down it seems, we don't get to see very much of W.O.W.'s good parts. Without spending time on IMDB I would guess this is a fairly old movie. No silicone, no tats, & real bush. It's your basic WIP storyline with much nicer scenery, literally & figuratively, even the prison matron is worth seeing. Thought provoking only if you want it to be, it could be a good comic book. I think some of the terminology lost something in the translation. It's a sci-fi action movie with blood & guts & a car chase. The ending is kind of odd... maybe to set up for a sequel.  Sometimes I could use some of that CPH4. The canned laughter takes away from the shows. I had forgotten about it. Otherwise the usual goofy irony is as remembered.  One bad CD in the 1st set. Amazon quickly replaced it & all is well. ....he's who you call when you want to kill the f#*king boogeyman. John is a man of focus, commitment, & sheer will...""  Lots of death, destruction, & retribution. Another ultimate bad-ass movie. It's well done too. Thought provoking only if you want it to be, it could be a good comic book.

Replacement & then refund handled quickly & efficiently by Amazon.  Picture quality & color was abysmal to start with & about 1/2 way thru the movie stopped & started numerous times before going completely haywire.  Bummer... Dyanna Thorne is best known for 2 things & we saw neither of them. The world in 1974 Appalachia tied into events from the 1860s. Interesting movie with a competent small cast.  Shot on location in western NC, in some familiar places.  Accurate historically, but it's not the same history they teach in school.  Picture & sound are good, but some of the dialog is indistinct, like talking away from the microphone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3A9XH3XDUM7MR," Disappointing becasue I really did not learn much if anything from this video.  They jump around and you hear little snippets of things but nothing that pulls things together.  If this Campbell guy is suppose to be so great I am not getting it from this DVD This movie looks like an Acting 101 high school production.  Cheryl Ladd must have gotten her break becasue she was hot looking at one point becasue she sure can't act.  Don't waste your time or money. Lame.  Is this suppose to be a school for slow kids?  A whole big school and you see about 30 kids in it.  Movie is slow, action is slow and getting to the end was way to slow.  No wonder the kid went crazy Purple Rain is OK but what did anyone see in Fame except for the one song?  In Fame, they took what looks like a bunch of losers from acting school and put them together in this mess of a movie.  What a waste, I couldn't even watch the whole thing is got so stupid and boring that I had to start fast forwarding the thing to get done.  Don't waste your money, if you like the spng download it. Purple Rain is OK but what did anyone see in Fame except for the one song?  In Fame, they took what looks like a bunch of losers from acting school and put them together in this mess of a movie.  What a waste, I couldn't even watch the whole thing is got so stupid and boring that I had to start fast forwarding the thing to get done.  Don't waste your money, if you like the spng download it. Why does Tom Cruise always have that stupid look on his face?  Probably because he crapped his pants becasue he cannot act.  How did he make is so far after his debut in this loser of a movie? I wish I could say this movie sucks but it is nowhere close to being that good.  I could not even finish watching this pile of dog poop.  Someone pick it up with the pooper scooper and put it in the thrash. Lame, was this a high school film project?  Story, acting, effects, all lame.  Towards the end of the movie there is some loser shooting a small handgun, I would guess the clip holds 7 rounds but this loser must fire off 30 rounds.  Amazing.  Dont waste your time buying or watching. After 30 minutes of this tripe I had to fast forward and barely got through doing that.  Whoever assembled this cast of losers should be taken out back and forced to watch this movie for 48 hours.  Good Grief, DON'T waste your time or money.  RUN, RUN, Run away! All is Lost?  No, not all, just the ten bucks I spent on this lousy pile of manure.  Wonder how long it took Robert to learn his lines for this sleeper.  Save your money and go watch the grass grow.  It will be a lot more entertaining. Pure crap.  The main character has the personality of a dead fish and where did they get her boyfriend, the used toilet brush store?  If you want gratuitous breast shots buy a Playboy and don't waste your money on this. Something provoked me to buy this movie and I wish I knew what it was so I would not do it again.  Unless you are desperate for a few nude shots there really isn't anything good about this movie.  Maybe it is better if you understand French.  The English subtitle version is basically a waste of time to watch. This has to be one of the dumbest movies yet.  Don't waste your money on this crap.  A two-year old could have made a better movie.  The only reason I gave it one star is because it would not let me give it no stars. It is OK  Nothing special.  A couple funny lines but overall not very entertaining.  Basic wine information which would be OK for someone that knows nothing about wine but not really worth the three hours of your time to learn the basics. Other than seeing nice looking girls this DVD is pretty lame.  You have some old turd using the old trick of making a movie in order to have sex with girls.  Art he calls it.  I call it slimy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3LDO43KPFU9I4," When I saw this in the theater many many  years ago, a redneck leaving at the same time said ""They got what they deserved!""  That shows how close to reality this movie comes.  Keeps me from ever visiting the South.  ""Save your Dixie Cups: The South Shall Rise Again!"" somebody wrote on the bathroom stall's wall.  Great acting and story.  Too bad the prejudice and racism are still rampant today. Most nature films are for kids, like that breakfast food.  Or Disney.  This one is actually suitable for adults too.  Cute but also intelligent on the subject of humans.  Humans can show their own limitations?? No wonder the French banned this anti-war and anti-generals movie!  Douglas can do anything!  Shocking.  Perfectly done in every way.  You are there in the trenches and at the trial, the sickening trial. One of the best nuclear-insanity movies.  Funny and serious at the same time.  I have watched it a dozen or more times over the years.  Still not sure how we still exist, thanks to lots of real Broken Arrows and other accidents with names. You know that there are ugly bullies and idiots on the road with you.  In my state, everyone is armed.  Dennis Weaver was a really nice guy.  Gunsmoke not.  Does The Devil have AAA insurance?  Well made movie shocker. Whew he could play a bad guy well.  Patty McCormack mentioned this movie as one similar in idea to THE BAD SEED in her interview on the MOMMY horror movie DVD. Another silly one for the sci-fi or horror Collector--with a capital C.  Some of the actors, especially like the famous General Mann from WotW, are obviously just going along with it, probably to make money.  Humor sneaks in in every scene.  Throw that stuffed dummy! I loved it every time I saw it on fuzzy VHS and TV, but this really deserved Blu-ray.  This is the most wonderful and insidiously-hypnotic musical, along side Eyes For You.  Busby B rules!  What perfection of dancing! I loved it every time I saw it on fuzzy VHS and TV, but this really deserved Blu-ray.  This is the most wonderful and insidiously-hypnotic musical, along side Eyes For You.  Busby B rules!  What perfection of dancing! Fun.  Michael, that was great when you were shot and looked like Jesus on The Cross flat on the pavement.  Great idea to be named Carpenter, too.  Music is awesome, if you will pardon that word which is over-used.  Theramin lives!!! Shows its age, but the girls are cute and the monster, paper mache on steroids??  I think I saw this one on early TV where special effects done by just a couple of guys were perfect enough in low resolution.  Safe to go back in the water?  Or the sci-fi horror closet... FINALLY!  I have had to collect lousy VHS tapes for years to watch this, and buy new tape players.  This sci fi is a real hoot!  Just marvel at the line about what we should take from a machine.  Quotable!  Koenig and Campbell are wonderful in this epic.  And WOW for the girl.  Wait for it.  She will appear. Dramatic re-enactment.  Emotional but not as detailed as the other extant documentary.  Bill W really suffered and made others suffer until he had a wonderful experience that herein is shown as a white-out.  Thank God or the Director for the real Bill W shown here.  Not for kids; very violent in parts. Amazing synchronization.  Bigger they are, the harder they fall, movie.  I love all handicap-documentary movies, so I am overlooking the strangeness of movies made in that era.  They fit the times, I guess.  Awfully dated.  Great singing, for sure. Even the Extra of Davison's interview is alone worth the price of the disc.  Has even rats that act better than some Hollywood kids.  Fun fun fun.  I guess some reviewer must have compared this to The Rat Pack.  A delightful horror movie, if you dare call it that. Too bad that beautiful women do not dress like that anymore.  Silly farce with a message.  Clifton Webb really acts like a Clifton Webb character.  Surprise surprise.  What a smash cast.  They did that back then in a weirdly innocent age. This ought to be required viewing by all parents, prosecutors and defenders, and fans of Woods, Davidovich, Ruehl, and Thomas.  What a horror story.  OMG, this really gets one very angry.  Shows how awful the so-called Legal Process, bad cops, and Government Officials can get.  Unjust accusations by a nutcase can turn a whole country into a mob.  ""Where is 'innocent until proven guilty' ?"" indeed. I bought this to see gorgeous Pamela Franklin, I admit.  And Bette Davis, for sure.  Another flick about people who are not who you think they are.  No way can I describe the plot, except you will hate yourself for making wrong calls.  You should hate yourself in this case; I do.  Is this a spoiler?? Lemmon is so mean and nasty and horrible, I began to wonder if the writer was really James Thurber, the Thurber I thought was so nice.  Lemmon does so good at playing a jerk I think he succeeded in making a funny HORROR MOVIE. What's not to love about a man so sick mentally that he does whatever comes to his deranged  mind?  Sounds like he should run for political office! There is a great book about the dangers of Invisibility: read it for further discussion of physics and psychology and famous other movies. Messiah of Evil?  Who?  L. Ron Hubbard?  Could obviously, but no.  Another slap at albinos; sick as it appears.  Even 10,000 B.C. had albinos, and it was an interesting movie.  Pray for the albinos of Africa: they do not cure HIV/AIDS but get killed anyway.  Horrible tragedy.  OK, this is not the only albino horror flick ever made. I had no idea how hilarious these episodes were to adults.  Jokes and leering and primitive special effects.  Slave men shoveling RADIUM into furnaces!  OMG!  Cities floating in air.  Laser guns.  It's all here.  Princess scowling at Earth girl and trying to run off and marry Flash Gordon.  When I was about 5, I asked my mom, seriously, Why didn't you name me Flash?! Does not follow the book stories exactly, but that is no reason to diss  it.  Smith is infinitely watchable.  I hope someone does more movies based on Asimov's collection under I ROBOT.  Asimov was a real genius who followed every story hypothesis to a reasonable conclusion. Tells more than I ever hoped to find, especially about THRESHER and SCORPION.  Great active map included which tells about most of the losses with pull-down windows.  Both we and the Russians have tried to raise sunken subs, with varying success.  Boomers are still out there.  The Cold War may be over, they say, but Rickover's warning about Armageddon is still possibly going to come true.  Boom and Doom anyone? Not up to today's standards of CGI-- it was TV--but some of the stories are good.  Sort of TWILIGHT ZONE with slightly less writing excellence.  About the only one I had remembered was THE INCONSTANT MOON, a sort of KNOWING without knowing until Coronal Mass Ejection happens.  But being a sci-fi nut, I had been looking for this set for years.  Thanks. Is this another HALLMARK movie?  Even so, if that were true,  it is excellently done, and is right for Christmas, especially with family mystery lovers.  Great actors in a good story. Amazing preview of history, science fiction with a view.  A woman astronaut, who would let that happen?  The rocketship and launch are wonderful, as is zero gravity, in a strange way.  SPOILER ALERT:  There is air on the backside of the Moon and you can set up a tent. I wish this was Blu-ray and remastered to be clearer.  Motion pixilation problems.  Still, the Indian melding of Superman, Batman, and Saturday Night Fever, with 4 fun music videos, is amazing. The author is well represented in this movie.  Hard to translate all the humor of the book into a straight forward funny movie.  Philosophy does not always morph as desired.  Perfect acting but necessarily slow on spots.  Take the Haley Mills PARENT TRAP and try to use a couple of questionable guys instead of Haley Mills and Haley Mills.  It's NOT Disney, but has its moments.  Adult comedy not for kids. Seeing his passing made me recall this wonderful little series.  Please someone put it all on DVD! More more more!  They demand at least 20 words to describe this perfect show?! WWII buffs will love this one.  I learned a lot about what was happening in the Pacific when I was a War Baby.  Lots of harsh language about ""Japs,"" but hard to see any way around that when our guys were being killed.  Mixture of actual footage, CGI, and interviews with survivors.

Another one bought to see the adorable Sandra Descher.  I confess.  A fun series that was continuous morality play.  Where did it go? TV GUIDE once said that MacMurray shot his scenes alone and they were edited into the family shots.  He was thus accused of dissing the other actors.  I don't know if that is true.  Engineers are never that obvious?  Just watch and laugh at the old level of humor. I feel like whoever I voted for turns out to be Dracula.  A character still being made into movies with real bite.  Sorry.  Anyway, I am glad for Blu-ray and Extras.  I needed a Life. Succeeds in shocking and being almost funny, but it is not for everyone.  That this is an adapted story, a TRUE STORY, is the biggest shock.  I am glad it is NOT about the notorious tobacco company.  Amazing how modern actors can do anything even gay behavior.  What bravery!!! Was this sad story or hilarious?  You decide. Henriksen in it got me to buy it.  Very low budget sci-fi effort.  SPOILER:  coming back in time to help self, an idea too simple.  Henriksen is about the only good actor in it. Not up to being a cult favorite.  I almost think it is a ripoff of Donovan's Brain.  Acting OK in a real turkey.  Why, I ask again over and over, do such movies deserve Blu-ray???! 5 stars for the excellent voice over commentary, 3 for the laughable movie.  I learned a lot from the selectable running description about the actors and the director and the studio.  The guy knows his stuff. Remember what happened at the end of THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES by H. G. Welles?  Or Orson Wells?  Either way you spell his name--I always forget--the Earth slows or stops spinning and everything flies into space.  History crammed into 2 hours instead of maybe 2 million years is a hard task.  Nice try.  Well done but I feel I have entered space without a vacuum-protection suit on. Unusual comic, very funny.  Truth hurts?  I want to find his act about donuts and French Fries.  I pray it exists on disc: the funniest show ever.  These bits are great too. Rock Hudson is not the only star in this documentary.  Takes a few well-know bios and gives lots of details you might have missed years ago.  This should be a continuing series.  After all, such horrible things are still done by some actors.  And people do still die young. Many years ago I took a class in Shakespeare from one of the ""World's Foremost Experts.""  S. Uncovered: Series 2 turns out to be better.  Anyone wanting to understand the Plays should watch both Series 1 and 2.  I have watched them twice, they are so well done. We loved it, but then we have horrible taste and love gratuitous killing, harsh language, and predictable endings.  Shame on us.  After this blast you must watch LONDON HAS FALLLEN.  Prayer does work? An amazing, accurate, behind-the-scenes expose of War.  The music is incredible, listenable over and over.  The information is well above the quality of other WW docs.  Just getting all the actual films together is mind boggling.  Heston was a great actor and here proves he is a perfect narrator. Hang in there through the beginning parties to find the wisdom and drama of life.  Proustian.  Awesome, almost update of La Dolce Vita but with more heart, if that is possible.  It is. Great up-to-date proof of evolution from fish to human.  Best for all ages.  There is no fraud or deception, contrary to what one misguided prejudiced reviewer has said.  Well worth watching all 3 sections. Perfect.  I hope there might be another Season, but things seem to have been tied up.  I and my wife were amazed at the detail of the sets and costumes, just amazed.  I never doubted for a minute that we were actually there witnessing the horrors of the hospital.  Acting is perfect.  More please!  Never a boring moment.  Full of surprise revelations and believable characters. Now with about 7 billion humans on Earth, are we a swarm too?  A hive mind bent on self destruction?  Don't think about that, but be amazed by this nature study with perfect camera work.  Great for the whole family, if science is loved. Oh common!!  When you find your mind wandering and feeling happy for a Joan Crawford character, watch out!  The film Devil is on your shoulder? The two girls who use the phone dangerously....they didn't have my number.  Dated horror flick.  One timer.  Preachy. A one-timer but that might be enough.  Another foodie movie with slapstick humor.  A worthwhile unprejudiced look at how people can work together in a good way.  Of course, we do need a lot less prejudice and a lot more bravery in telling truth to power. It's sort of a companion piece to The Ninth Gate?  I could watch her devilishly for hours--in fact I have.  Honest, erotic, and funny.  Feminization was never so delightful before.  Scholars will be citing this movie forever.  Not for kids, but who the he** would have shown it to them anyway?! Thanks for taking away my need to spend thousands of dollars to travel far north.  Amazing new way of photographing aurora.  Now you can see things change relatively fast, without freezing to death. Although I love the star, this movie uses too many old ideas.  Essie Davis is interviewed, explains the movie, and seems as worn out as the main character.  We could watch her in her delightful crime series forever.  Crowd sourcing finances a lot of failures, unfortunately.  My wife hated it.  I only prayed for 1) the kid institutionalized,  2) the wife actually helped by a shrink, and 3) at least one NEW horror-story idea, for Heaven's Sake!  ONE! Okay, I'll watch any movie with Cate Blanchett, I must admit.  And I am often disappointed with greedy Disney.  I miss the hand-drawn cartoons, but who can fight Progress and Computers?  Not me. Another great movie about Artists.  Perfect acting and directing and photography and sets and music.  I bought those big-eye prints and recall the little waif on the stairs.  There is a good history about the husband in print.  A warning too for our daughters!  Watch MR. TURNER and see from BIG EYES that some things have not changed. Could hardly be any more shocking.  At the end, I wished for a detailed explanation of what finally happened to the hero.  Have to look elsewhere.  I guess the horror is just suggested by the short clip of him leaving for a hunting trip or shooting range.  Gotta watch it again some day. Has anyone already said It Really Has Bite?  This is the treatment that Serious vampire/werewolf movies deserved for centuries.  But you have to have a sense of humor to enjoy it. One of the best series ever made.  Perfect acting, direction, costumes, sets, cinematography, stories, music....everything!!  Amazing and truly loveable and digs deep into the human condition.  Nuns hopefully are still as lovely at all ages as shown..  Even an atheist like me falls in love with their characters.  We hope the series can go on into the future. More proof that our damn government is run by evil people OF BOTH PARTIES!  This doc is now at the top of my list of great documentaries.  I will be showing this one to lots of people. An excellent documentary summary of Welles' whole life and especially career, at a depth never before attempted.  Gives both the Genius and Obstacles appropriate coverage.  I plan to watch it again, and watch his movies that already are available on discs, and pray for more of the lost ones to be found. How many silly movies can use this subject?  Please, God, get it over with!  We are all tired of waiting for The BIg One.  Have it happen at 3 AM so fewer people will suffer.  Keep the wives and kids at home so that you can save others using your helicopter.  Or give everybody their own helicopter, please, so they can escape on their own without Studio help.  Move out of California, folks! Has something to say about the end of all careers.  Worth watching for guys like me who fell in love with the gorgeous ballerina.  What eye candy!  This movie is the ultimate Chaplin personal statement.  Most everything he ever did on film was Genius. Nice to see more of my favorite actors.  Wife liked the first better.  Could have watched that Bollywood dancing forever!  That girl really has the moves!  Reminded me of the wonderful ending dancing in THE GURU. Five stars for acting and special effects, but maybe 2 for being just another silly magic show.  Take LABYRINTH and tear off a little THE ILLUSIONIST.  (One of the stars, perfect in THE ILLUSIONIST, here plays a bigger part but in a less interesting movie.) SEE San Andreas Quake for another silly Warning That Nobody Will Heed.  Please God, get it over with!  Move out of California, if you can!  Duck and cover.  Don't put anything heavy over your bed.  Especially a bookshelf with hundreds of San Andreas quake DVDs. Nice to see more of my favorite actors.  Wife liked the first better.  Could have watched that Bollywood dancing forever!  That girl really has the moves!  Reminded me of the wonderful ending dancing in THE GURU. A perfect demonstration that real estate people can live on greed, lookie-loos are often nasty people, and This Nest Is Best.  Perfect acting, as anticipated.  We guessed before buying that God is an Artist, but not that He lives in a New York apartment.  Is there anything more important to humans than Happiness?  Oh, you say Money? From horrors to possible redemption.  Wonderful photography and plea for understanding and improvement.  Hell on earth, but the possibility of a brighter future.  Takes a strong stomach to see how bad things are around the world. A bit Disneyish, but done perfectly.  Delightful for all ages, and another ""How did they get a performance like that out of little kid?!""  Must see for parents who are either racist bigots who want to reform, bullies who need to reform, or people looking for ways to save themselves and others.  Wife loves it and shows it often. You better watch this one if you plan to move to NY.  A shocking documentary, and it is all true.  Only an issue of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN did the engineering side better by detailing how and why it happened, down to the circuit level.  Otherwise this doc is perfect. Wonderful science historical drama with re-enactments using actual instruments.  I wish this existed when I was a kid.  Very watchable and fun.  Proves how far humans have come from the Dark Ages.  And you won't find any of this knowledge in The Bible; science is a human invention. A seriously damaged kid turns into a seriously damaged adult....comedian who can rant up a storm against Huge Injustices.  Five stars for the view of a real damaged life and one star for kicking me in the private parts.  Five stars for attacking the Vatican Cover-up and one star for just standing out in front of his Catholic church and yelling and screaming.  The average of 5 and 1 is 3.  Take your choice.  I dunno.  Does God cry? Heartwarming is a word my high school English teacher told our class would result in an automatic F.  He said Never use that word, or else.  This is an amazing heartwarming documentary and we hope the batkid recovers.  Only in San Francisco could people turn out in thousands for one little sick kid in treatment. Excellent documentary with some fine re-enactments.  Filled with actual survivors testimony.  Keeps one alert for what happened to the girl, girls, and boys.  I think I would not have survived such treatment and loss of parents.  OUCH! With all the other Young-Genius movie biopics out now, this achieves the highest level of Acting, but seriously disappoints by the end.  SPOILER ALERT:  Should be listed as a Romantic Comedy aka Boy Genius Derailed By Love.  I have to confess that my Expectations were my personal limitation.  It succeeds as Love Conquers All but disappoints the mathematician in me. OMG this movie is a kick in the stomach!  So Real!  Could be called a Documentary, but has perfect acting.  If you don't cry seeing what has been done to poor people then you have a rock for a personality. Perfect movie!  Shows the reality of Cold War America.  Freedom of speech is still a huge issue here.  Cranston certainly is amazing.  Trumbo even wrote the anti-war movie script for Rocketship X-M.  (See the Wikipedia about RXM.)  And Trumbo wrote the script for the perfect modern western LONELY ARE THE BRAVE, which celebrates Freedom. I wish there were more wonderful movies like this one.  Reality and humor.  Perfectly done by everyone, acting, directing, writing, music composition, sets, costumes, even matching hands (see the Extras).  Did I miss anyone?  We will show this to a certain racist we know, unless he gets elected, and then he will try to ban it. Might be slightly too funny for reaching Realistic, but it sure is Fun to watch! And of course, that adorable redhead--who took over from another milder actress after the first episode or so--sure made my heart race. Tackles every important Problem of the time with astonishing accuracy.  Brave writing and acting. Amazing that Cernan did this, it's so honest.  Amazing video, reconstructions, and heartfelt descriptions from the men who made it all possible.  Every citizen should watch this one to see how human these brave men are. Hard to love a movie about concentration camps and Nazis revenged.  Plummer is horrifyingly believable.  Twists in plot really leave one spinning. I want to show this one to family members who have already made up their minds about other people.  Shocking.  Oh, I can't remember if I already showed it to them.  Not a good way to go. Not an armed invasion like the USA often does, but a trek through other countries to see what works far better over there.  Americans need to see this documentary!  We really need to copy other folks and not just B.S. about ""making America great again.""  Judged by this film, America never was a place for social justice and successful Life.  Travel widens, right?  Great is relative! You can watch this OR watch the Presidential Conventions this week.  We are addicted to HoC, an insider's view of suspicions-confirmed reality.  Let's see T-rump's tax returns, please.  And where are the bodies buried? I will greatly miss James Horner.  As a sci-fi fan--mostly deranged, of course--I love ALIENS and his score.  I did not know that he did like over 300 scores, some not yet heard.  This is a wonderful concert and unique-one-man award show.  We intend to show it to all our music-loving friends. Everything unexpected, including reveals about male actors and horrible studio chiefs.  I know that Genius is an over-used word, but watch this documentary!  This one is done with wit and humor and features a running gag that never fails to make one LOL. An early show, full of homespun humor.  Not much need for cussing here for laughs, none at all.  Just his expressions can roll you on the floor.  I still am hunting for his routine about donuts and French Fries.  I pray that it is on disc somewhere.  Meanwhile, this set is hilarious.  Boyhood with a little brother?  Yoicks! The best religious movie ever made.  Watched it 5 times so far, reading the subtitles out loud for people on my couch.  The music and singing and acting are all perfect.  I tried to get the Pastor of my family's church to watch it, but he is too afraid. WOW!  This is one of those ""There but for the grace of God go I"" and an up close demonstration of how some friends and relatives can act civilized. Wonderful documentary. Fun with pretty girls in cute costumes.  No telling peoples' tastes?  Sorry.  The buildup at the beginning is ridiculous, and so are the people in the box watching.  This movie could be editing down to the singing and dancing numbers, I wish.  Funny if you have a low thresh.... Oh, please just cremate me and dump my ashes on the back bank.  This documentary is truly amazing.  Good that a good man can help the widows and widowers with sincerity.  A real Business Success undertaking. The best religious movie ever made.  Watched it 5 times so far, reading the subtitles out loud for people on my couch.  The music and singing and acting are all perfect.  I tried to get the Pastor of my family's church to watch it, but he is too afraid. Great history of a horrible genocide.  That Turkey still denies the genocide almost explains some of what is going on today.  We have Holocaust Deniers and Climate Change Deniers, all ugly yelling fools.  Japan still denies the WWII Comfort Women were kidnapped and raped, calling them whores who just want reparations.  There is no limit to human inhumanity. No more Thanksgiving B.S. after watching this excellent documentary with convincing re-enactments.  The ""Indians"" saved the colonists, the colonists brought diseases that killed the majority of ""Indians.""  Truth was told here. Amazing documentary, very heartfelt.  Historical demonstration of the horrors of American Prison Camps during WWII.  As a kid, I witnessed our Japanese-American neighbors hauled away, and it was horrifying.  Sickening.  This artist really suffered at our hands.  Let's pray that America does NOT become that kind of Evil Great ever again. I did not know that Germany invented and built these things.  My TV experience started in about 1948, a long time after it was used in Germany under the Nazis.  Great documentary! Okay, I'm white from the days of Early TV but I just loved this Series anyway, though parents had to be away.  I am glad for this behind the scenes documentary, and recently found a few complete series DVDs to enjoy again.  These actors and actresses were wonderful. Well done elementary discussion & history.  Now there are about 10 times as many exoplanets known as said in this.  And Marcy has been an early harassment-accused celebrity.  Success and Failure, but still a good doc. I practically slept through that horrible era.  This shows how evil our government can be, even today.  Ellsberg and Snowden are heroes.  Where is John Adam's ghost now when we need him?!  Government bullies foster domestic terrorists.  What you sow so shall ye reap.  Let us demand transparency?  Never worked in The Vatican or the FBI. Horrifying to encounter a case or two where you believe The Jury made wrong decisions.  Frightening to think Justice could be NOT done.  Life is short and does Evil exist?  TV versions of Forensics are truly phony. Amazing that all the studios wanted Ken Murray to polish their actors' home lives, of course not mentioning secrets that might have upset the prejudiced Public.  (There is a great documentary about the famous Aussie costume designer's gay friends, but this is not that one.) Thanks to a scene showing the knocking (brain penetration) of a cow, this is NOT FOR KIDS.  Not even for wives.  Otherwise, knowing now that people all over the planet have to get up, urinate, dress, eat breakfast, go to work, is not an exciting discovery.  Let them do their own stories about 24 hours?  Some glints of intelligence, but mostly boring stuff.  This probably looked more interesting on paper. Surprisingly complete picture of the chaos following Pearl Harbor.  How did we win with such insanity going on?  Thank God we had a great president back then.  (No comment on the present one.....) Proved to me that, even as a scientist, I do not have the patience to perfect a dish like is shown in this documentary.  Amazing!  Not exactly like those two silly guys who visit lots of restaurants and just say Yum.  Details details details.  OMG.  Can you stand to see such details?? Great for children.  Heaven forbid that Hollywood or The Internet does a remake.  OMG, imagine it done with (red) condoms, similar to what was actually used for bubbled underground rock in the 50's sci-fi movie INVADERS FROM MARS.  No, don't even imagine it.  Is it Rule 34?  Anyway, show this one to your kids before they grow up into nasty Web Jokers. The best most-up-to-date documentary about nuclear weapons proliferation.  Interviews with top experts like Rhodes.  Story of spies, all of them.  Men who sold out humanity for their nation and just to make money.  Japanese bomb project.  History of closest calls.  Grim truth everyone should see. Gee, people way back then were amazing talented and worth watching.  One of my kids said that when I showed this wonderful disc to her.  Thank you, Dream Factory!  Is that too late? Scary, for its time.  Allyson in a different sort of role.  And because I have watched Forbidden Planet a thousand times, a good example of Walter Pigeon's ""other excellent work.""  That voice.  Why didn't my mom and dad fix my vocal chords to sound like his? Lamarr and Allyson are lovely, but this is a pseudo-Disney farce.  Gee, I wonder how Disney came up with the idea, but much later.  Or not.  Time travel is possible?  It is if you watch this silly movie.  Big question: Hedy or June for your dreams? Good thing she has a stalking order against me.  Well, maybe she does.  I was told long ago that You tell a beautiful woman she is Smart, and a Smart woman she is beautiful.  But what do you do if both apply?  When I was at my mother's knee, I didn't listen to her.  Why? What did she say?  I don't know.  I didn't listen.  This Tale is worth listening to indeed.  And watching.  It's like Masterpiece Theater. Are such sweet family entertainments gone forever??  Even LOST IN SPACE became a Major Motion Picture full of nasty disgusting kids.  Please, Hollywood, don't even try to update (i.e. screw up) Ozzie & Harriet. O'Brien is wonderful !  Great story.  Beery is something else, quite an actor in a delightful role.  Native Americans might object to having Mormons killing their guys surrounding the wagons, but an explanation is given for their error in attack.  Not many old movies do that. Millennium is the cult movie it deserves to be.  I saw it (censored on TV) years ago and wanted to see it again.  The cigarette smoking is the worst thing about Millennium.  Honestly, I have not watched ROTOR yet.  M is sufficient to the price of the disc.  I think M might just be a satire of the present world.  Let's get out of it soon to a brighter city?  Should we want to go ahead in time?  Ok.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2WDMII0ZK0O5X," Excellent movie for comedy! Anna Nicole Smith has a role in this movie before her demise, and of course OJ Simpson is included too. The Zanuk brothers have done it again in the last sequel to the Naked Gun series. Hilarious and if you want to laugh, again, this is the movie for you. No depression exists here! For younger viewers, I would suggest parental control. Another favorite. Dabney Coleman continues to play the character of a chauvenistic, male boss who thinks that his sh*t doesn't stink. He gets his comeuppence too in a way that is unexpected. I still have strong feelings about Jane Fonda, but the real stars are Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton who wrote, sang and starred this comical movie. Superb! Mel Brooks and cast are as funny as ever! I had seen this movie before, and it still continues to make me laugh! He has a parody of likeness from the master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock. He did a magnificent job as I recorgnized the action from many of Hitchcock's films. If you are a fan of both Mel Brooks and Alfred Hitchcock, then this film is a must see for you! Enjoy! :-) LOVE this film! Mel Brooks satire on Robin Hood with more modern cliches' but staying with the original story (or at least what we know of). Hilarious fun and again the jokes that you really have to sit and listen for as you watch the movie. It definitely will keep you entertained! lol Mel Brooks does make a cameo appearance like Stephen King does, watch for him! lol I will always love this movie. It actually is a more modern version of the sitcom Beverly Hillbillies, but more than funny. This plot showed Jed looking for a mom for his daughter Ellie May, and the revelation that there will always be someone who is jealous of anyone being successful to take money away from you if you are not too careful. GREAT family entertainment. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!! It is way too cute and I love it! A follow up from the song, ""I don't know history...."" but he is sure he is in love with her. Einstein and his comrades connive a way for his niece (Meg Ryan) to finally see Tim Robbins who is an auto mechanic with no letters next to his name. Even genius's can see when a couple is not right for each other, especially snotty ones. lol A comedy about the goings on of a crew and a Captain that is hand picked to set up for failure on the high seas. It will keep you laughing but does have its serious moments. It will hold your attention throughout the movie, I promise. lol I have seen this movie several times, but it still makes me laugh, regardless. lol A mediocre film but when I was stationed in HI, this movie was being made. During the beach scene, a woman that took care of my son was shown in the background. You can't miss her, she is the one that throws her head and red hair back as an extra. We did not get along needless to say, but she is there! Other than that, the usual confusion on this satire of the Brady Bunch. This movie is definitely not a Oscar winner, however, it holds your attention throughout the movie. The plot starts with the activities leading up to an accident, then there is a twist. You would think that this is the result of the main accident, but the twists makes you wonder if she could really see the person. The ending is a very pleasant surprise but it is a great movie to watch for young teenage adults. This movie surprised me when I finally saw it. I had seen it advetised but did not think twice about it. Finally, finding nothing else, it was surprisingly entertaining and I found myself wanting to see the second part to it. I found myself rooting for Prince Eddie and even Paige! These two belong together! But the movie also showed scenes of Denmark and the fact most of all that Royals have feelings. A VERY enjoyable movie! This movie is definitely not a Oscar winner, however, it holds your attention throughout the movie. The plot starts with the activities leading up to an accident, then there is a twist. You would think that this is the result of the main accident, but the twists makes you wonder if she could really see the person. The ending is a very pleasant surprise but it is a great movie to watch for young teenage adults. I have always enjoyed Shirley Temple or Shirley Temple Black in her movies. This video revealed some lesser known information about Shirley, but this does not deter me from admiring her. My brother and sisters and I were fortunate enough to see her doll collection at the Children's Museum in Los Angeles, CA before they were given to Charity. I was disappointed because she had a vast collection of them from everywhere in the world. Excellent movie for young adults and adults who are tired of bloody gore and sex. This movie surprised me but with a plot that was mysterious and wondering about who done it and showed villains that were given their just reward in the end. Of course, I cry for all animals especially horses and I appreciated the plot as it went along. Again, this film will be enjoyed by young adults and up and for those who love horses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A31UN01C95N0TV," Great cast of female actors. A very touching story about family and friendly relationships. Was not expecting this to be a sad movie, but it shows the ups and downs in people's lives and I was surprised to find out it was sad. Great to see such a nice cast of actresses together. Too bad we don't see many movies with such a great ensemble of great actors. The storyline is 3 stars, but Kevin Spacey's performance is 5 stars.  This actor is truly a talented actor.  He can sing and dance and act and direct, making this movie a nice movie to watch.  However, at times this movie was a bit slow and long.  Kevin Spacey does an excellent performance in this movie, and makes up for it's lengthiness. An amazing film with high quality videos of places that I know most people will never get to see in real life.  All the sceneries were just beautiful.  The environmental conscious narrative was very informative.  Amazing to see how some people and animals live, and that not everyone is living life surrounded by electricity or have the same high quality utilities that richer nations have in its cities.  Great cinematography.  A must see movie. Wow, excellent movie that verifies my thoughts about what is so unfair in America.  Love the country but hate the greed. It makes me wonder if the United States will one day go through ""The Tales of Two Cities"" in which there will be a revolution of the bourgeoisie 1% (Haves) and the 99% Middle/Low Class (Have-Nots).  ""The rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer"" seems to hold true and will one day cause an upheaval.  Sad. I didn't know what to expect, but I like this movie a lot. Very similar to Hunger Games, but way better as its characters are much deeper in their emotional displays and the groups are divided with a much more complex design than Hunger Games' haves and have-nots. It's got those into justice, vs intelligence, vs bravery, vs givers, etc. This is a story about tragic events taking place all because of one selfish act that a boy made of hiding his father's car keys during the holiday season when he wanted his father home.  From there forward, tragedy unravels, and we are taken into the world of this boy's future after what he did with the keys.  However, he gets a chance to correct his mistake and we see what the boy chooses to do with this opportunity. A relaxing and enjoyable movie about love between a guy who is an English teacher who expresses in words and a gal who is an Art teacher who expresses herself through art and images.  There is a healthy competition between the two on what is more powerful, words or art, in expression.  It's a love story that shows how the two worlds can merge or be apart. This is a slow moving film. Acting was fine. Directing was artistic. The problem is that there is hardly any story. The kids are spending their last loving summer together before one of them is going off to a school away from their small town. Not much more than that and we watch how they spend the summer with the thought that they will miss each other soon. For its time, I have to say the special effects were pretty good.  It's a story about human desires.  We long to be young and long for the love of our lives.  We want things that we often cannot have, such as being able to live forever and being in love with someone who loves someone else.  Those are the things these characters desire, but in the end, such greed creates disasters. This is a 1980s romantic movie, a love story about a male secretary and his female boss.  It was a period when women started to be in position of power.  This movie offers a glimpse on how one woman used her position and how one man responded.  Cute fun movie.  In some circles, they would find this movie to be an excellent way to discuss the potential for harassment if they were not in love. It was okay if you grew up in the 1980s and you missed William Shatner for a while.  This is an interesting movie that kind of made fun of the Star Trek fans itself.  William Shatner played himself in this movie, while all other characters are movie/tv producers/writers.  Story-wise, this is a boring movie, but there is something nostalgic about this movie and convoluted that it was making fun of itself as fans of Star Trek in the 1980s. For its time, I have to say the special effects were pretty good.  It's a story about human desires.  We long to be young and long for the love of our lives.  We want things that we often cannot have, such as being able to live forever and being in love with someone who loves someone else.

A2ZGA89FE61NFO," This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's dark, has great music, the acting (meh) is, well, not the best, and the filmography is kind of amazing for its time. It was a ground-breaking movie in its time for lots of reasons, but they should have seriously considered the time placement! LOL I truly wish there were more episodes or seasons of this epic show. But, all good things must come to an end. Well done, better effects, great to see Zan again - extra special!!  Oops! Spoiler alert. :-) I found this movie to be very revealing of the evangelical subculture in the US American Midwest. The movie and the children presented paint a frightening picture of parts of our nation's future. Well worth watching and becoming aware of major educational and societal problems in our heartland. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's dark, has great music, the acting (meh) is, well, not the best, and the filmography is kind of amazing for its time. It was a ground-breaking movie in its time for lots of reasons, but they should have seriously considered the time placement! LOL This movie is very informative about the US corn production as well as the GMO aspect of US agriculture. It's pervasive and awful. The documentarians didn't wrap up the entire story, though, about the corn DNA in their hair. If you stay off corn products for however long, doesn't the corn DNA found in your hair disappear? That's the outstanding question for me from the movie, which is frustrating. This is one of my favorite movies of all time.

That's the outstanding question for me from the movie, which is frustrating. Fun, thrilling movie. Wish they'd stop doing the whole ""origin story"" each time they reboot the friggin franchise. Enough already - everyone knows it!! MOVE ON and tell the next stories. This movie is such a good depiction of the book and the events written about in the book. Brings to ""real life"" what my imagination has created time and time again when I've read the book. It's a must-see for fantasy enthusiasts. This movie was very inspiring on so many fronts. The content also left some questions outstanding - for myself - but in general, the inspiration was to eat better and fresher foods and to seek out local farms. Support your local farms. I would really like to follow up on the statistics presented in the movie, though, just for clarity's sake. Some of the numbers seem too good to be true. If you like a Trip To Bountiful, this is a black & white version of the movie, with a couple of modern twists (like a shirt hikin' moment...). Still, very emotional and poignant and highlightive of a family with multiple issues, such as dealing with others' losses, standard familial issues, (no gay thang this time), and historical stuff no one knows about or learns. Great movie, though, and stupendous, Oscar-level performances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A1QFXPPUHEN141," I love aviation history.  This is a great story of the development of a very valuable and essential WW2 weapon and told quite well.  The documentary after the film added value to the film. I saw this film the first time many years ago when I lived in Wichita and had to travel as shown in the film.  It is too real to really be funny.  Still, I watched it again and had the same painful memories of my travel experiences of the time this was first released.  I miss Candy. It was worth watching.  Good plot line and execution of the plot.  It shares a common mistake of American movie depiction of Communism in that they are depicted as westerners in clothing and grooming.  Actually they were very primitive and crude in attire.  Also their technology was primitive by western standards.  They did reasonably well with the cars and buildings. This movie clearly shows the hopeless grief that people who don't know God suffer after a loss.  It also shows that the producers mock God by their portrayal of a support group in a church.  While the story is quite true for many who deny God, it is too bad that the producers chose to believe that that is the only way people grieve.  I know that it isn't by my own experience. Not enough credit was given to Dodd and Frank for the disaster they created.  I wish that more of the actors had looked like the real people.  Otherwise it was well worth watching. Well worth watching.  Shows that politicians were corrupt then too.  I'll have to do some research to see if the movie accurately portrayed the facts or that the writers/producers had a political agenda that they needed to bend the facts to fit. Well worth watching.  Shows that politicians were corrupt then too.  I'll have to do some research to see if the movie accurately portrayed the facts or that the writers/producers had a political agenda that they needed to bend the facts to fit. Good story of the kind I like.  This one was difficult to know who the good guys were.  A lot of the extreme action was not very believable.  Never the less I enjoyed watching it. A very good presentation of the evil a government can do to its own people.  This travesty did not need to happen!  Well worth watching to understand the impact of corruption and incompetence in government. Having recently visited Israel, I was fascinated by this tour guided by Netanyahu.  It showed places that I was unable to visit because I didn't have Netanyahu as my guide.  I recommend this video to everybody that wants to know truth about Israel, especially Obama. A real look at war from those in battle.  It gets you beyond the political definition of war to see the commitment of our military on the front line to each other and to those oppressed by Muslim fundamentalists in Afghanistan.  I would recommend this film to anyone interested in the truth about our military. Well done!  I trained as a nuclear engineer because of Rickover's work.  If we had a few people in government today with his skills and motivation we could have a functioning government. It was a waste of money.  There didn't seem to be a plot.  Much of the dialog was not understandable.  And things happened that had no logical reason to be in the movie.  I suspect that the writer and producer were on drugs when they did their respective parts. I watched about 15 minutes before leaving because of the depiction of brutal mutilation and murder of women.  The story may have been worth telling but the depiction of the brutality wasn't",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3PT6HRQCM1HE4," Just love this simple little movie. Something for everyone. Drama. humor, mystery, you pretty much can find it all here. And the acting is all top notch. Great way to spend an afternoon. The best version thus far. Lots of behind the scenes stuff and the commentaries are interesting. The alternant ending is interesting, but I think the ending as finally filmed is way better. The version to have if you love the movie. An enjoyable matinee type movie. Not the best of this type of movie, but very worth a look. This features Both Robert Redford and Jane Fonda at the beginning of their film careers along with screen veterans/legends Charles Boyer and Mildred Natwick in supporting roles. A bit dated for today's audiences maybe, but once you get past that, you'll enjoy it for what it is, a very good evening's entertainment. A great lite version of Hamlet. First rate acting, cinematography and direction make this a version worthy of multiple viewings. Sure some plot points are altered or missing from the original, but this film works very well without them. If you'd like to see the full version of Hamlet, check out  Kenneth Branaugh's version of Hamlet. Simply the definitive version of Robin Hood. the role that Errol Flynn was born to play. The extra features on this 2 (DVD) disc version are great. The documentaries on the Technicolor process and the making of the movie itself are top notch and the Looney Tunes shorts are classics in their own right. The Howard Hill short showing his prowess with shooting a bow and arrow was entertaining. Man! Could he shoot or what? Just pure entertainment! Enjoyable classic Disney. A bit corny by today's standards, but enjoyably so. Fred McMurray is great as always and silent film superstar Lillian Gish is terrific in her role as Hetty Siebert. Many other greats in other roles. This was Kurt Russell's first film for Disney. I just received this earlier today and I must say it is one of the best documentaries on mental illness that I ever viewed. It is very engaging and thought provoking without becoming overly verbose or technical. The people involved are very easy to relate to and the fact that they vary in age and backgrounds is a big plus as well.  It has the feel of a ""good talk amongst friends"". Well done, Mr. Pantoliano! I saw this back when it first came out on NBC and I liked it back then and I still like it. It has a good mix of a bit of everything. A compelling story, drama, action, humor, talented acting, great effects... this is perfect for a few nights of entertainment. 5/5 stars! I just love this one! It is not a remake of the original. it tells what happens a few generations after the time of the original movie. The characters have some similarities to the ones from the original movie, but they are most definitely their own distinct characters. the story is fresh and original and each of the actors seem to be perfect for their roles. 5/5 stars! True life action drama that holds your attention throughout. This one should have done lots more business at the theaters than it did. Everyone that I know who has seen it has liked it. Like most such films some liberty has been taken with the truth but the general facts of the rescue itself are pretty accurate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1VA668FZW965P," I sneaked into a movie theater as a 15-year old to watch this R-rated movie back in 1969. Powerful, great bikes, scenery, slices of life from around the country on their trip. Phil Spector has a cameo early in the film. A timeless classic. I thought this movie was super! It showed virtually all forms of motorcycle racing. Not only that, but since it was made in 1971, it was quite nostalgic, showing Steve McQueen and his friends racing. He was actually quite good. I wonder if the movie studios knew the risks he was taking. He actually broke his foot once, but finished the race anyway. A gem. Good movie. Sexy young women on motorcycles, with a subtext of addiction and recovery and relapse, with a lot of drama thrown in causing some scary scenes. A tiny bit corny, but by my standards it leaves little to be desired. Kept me very much occupied for a couple of hours. I watch movies primarily to be entertained, and I prefer to end my movie watching with at least an OK feeling. Not that everything has to be a powder puff, but this was brutal. Like a bad acid trip. The story of four people and their drug-induced descent into a personal hell. I watch movies primarily to be entertained, and I prefer to end my movie watching with at least an OK feeling. Not that everything has to be a powder puff, but this was brutal. Like a bad acid trip. The story of four people and their drug-induced descent into a personal hell. Excellent suspense movie. Manages to have you on the edge of your seat without resorting to gratuitous violence or juvenile cursing. Fast moving without being so fast it makes you seasick. I highly recommend Panic Room. Exciting, and not too plot-heavy. Just too much profanity. Anyone who knows me knows that I'm no prude, but when nearly every sentence spoken has at least one s- or f- word in it, come on now. Seems immature and pandering. This movie, I think, was saved by its ending. Surprising, even shocking. The bulk of the movie seemed rather formulaic. An attractive hunk do-gooder gets stuck in a thankless job pitted against a vile regime. Okay if you don't expect too much. It was an okay movie, but awfully violent. Quentin Tarantino-style. It shouldn't have surprised me, but I don't really go for excess gore and pain. Nice bikes, though, and a halfway decent plot, good filming. Mostly just a low-budget rebuttal of a Dan Rather report on the town of Willimantic, CT, and its heroin problem. Sort of a rah-rah piece only of interest to people of the Willimantic area who didn't like Rather's show. Tries to show the town as full of good people, not drug addicts. Boring. The plot is twisted and fascinating. The characters are great. At first, I was put off by the violence, but the show displays a good bit of affection and love as well. Very macho, but tolerably so. Super series - part of the new golden age of TV. Great special effects. Bloody gross-out to the max. I'm trying to catch up before the new season, and it's a treat to be able to watch it without commercial breaks. This movie an eccentric treat, with beautiful Suzanne Mays and Brad Blaisdell as a completely believable ""retired"" mobster who befriends Mays' character and all sorts of unexpected occurrences proceed from that friendship. It starts as a murder in the past, and makes its way back to the present, as the waitress and ex-mobster tread a dangerous path together. Not too good. The only reason I watched it was because it's winter in Massachusetts and I can't ride my motorcycle. I understand there's some kind of backstory to it about somebody buying the rights to the original Easy Rider and making a solipsistic sequel that had nothing to do with the original. It doesn't matter. Not good for much. I really, really like Forensic Files. It condenses a murder case to a half-hour TV show, minus commercials. They do a really good job of it. The only trouble is that I've been watching the show since it was on Court TV many years ago, and it's hard to find an episode that I haven't seen before. I really liked this movie. The cinematography was great, and it was quite suspenseful, with surprising twists along the way. Different kind of movie, a lot of classical music and winter landscape scenes. In this movie, it's another motorcycle-crazy sixties youth-oriented trashy scene. In other words, it's just what the doctor ordered for a day when my bike is in the shop and I feel low. Good for the soul. If you like old biker movies, Ross Hagen and company will satisfy you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A37M1C40G34OJA," As a fan of the Original Invasion of the Body Snatchers & the 1978 ensemble cast remake of it, this one doesn't rank very high as a ""Re-Make"".  While it isn't bad per se, it isn't that good either.  It does have a few memorable moments.  Such moments include Meg Tilly's character's chilling  speech about where her family is going to go & Forrest Whittiker's frantic realization of what's happening.   Overall, this is a middle of the road horror/sci-fi I have always wanted to get this series.  Well, I finally bought it at a fantastic price.  All 3 films are in great shape & loaded with extras.  Bottom line, having all 3 films in a slimline case is great & fits right into my collection Demon Seed was one of those Techno Horror films that was just a bit ahead of its time.  A computer controlled house that falls in love with its creator's wife was definitely not one would expect at the time it came out.  Witch made it all the more scarier I remember seeing this in the movie theatre when it came out.  I was highly impressed.  I wound up finding this at a discount store for $3.  Of course I wound up buying it.   While this is the usual 1980's low budget, they really make this an enjoyable film.  And as a remake of the original, it works suprisingly well.  I hope they get this on Blu-Ray soon Who doesn't like Yul Brenner?  Or the ever Beautiful Gina Lolabridgeda?  I know I really appreciate a film with either of them acting in it.  But together in a film, MAGIC!  I got this for a friend of mine & he is just loving this. Another of Mill Creek Entertainment's mostly ""Public Domain"" movie pack.  B-Rates are sometimes a really good thing to watch.  And Mill Creek Entertainment makes it easy to buy these.  And keep ones collection stocked full of movies It is always great when Disney releases some of it's classic films fromit's movie vaults.  Jungle Book is one of those films from a by-gone era that never seem to get old.  They just don't make cartoon movies like they used to!  The Jungke book on Blu-Ray is a definate plus!  So if you're a fan of Disney Classics, this is one that you need to pick up! Ever since I saw this little know gem in theatres (Yes it was in theatres!), I have enjoyed it considarably.  While it does have it's share of cheap thrills...It's the overall effect & plotline that I enjoy in this Movie.  The gradual build of tension.  Especially between the main characters is nice.  The Lovecraftian theame is excellent The Hills Have Eyes is one of Wes Craven's early work.  And as Arrow has made a LTD Special Edition of it, it was worth it for me to buy it.  Let's face it, having the film picture improved and having LOADS of extras with Arrow's editions is always nice!!!!   If you like this film, This edition is worth having While I am not a HUGE fan of the ""Biblical"" film, there are certain of these films that literally Stand out.  El Cid. The Ten Commandments.  Ben Hur. The King Of Kings is one of those that stand out.  This film should be one of those in anyone's collection along with the others.  I got this for a Co-Worker of mine.  She absolutely LOVES it!  The Transfer to Blu-ray is AWSOME. One of my co-workers desperately wanted to get this movie.  Mostly because he wanted to show some people what it would be like without an important part of our population.  I wound up getting it for him.  Hopefully I will be able to borrow it from him to see this movie for myself.  I have heard many positive things about this film Who likes having a crotchety old man living next to or near you?  But Watching a pair of old curmudgeons in a comedy....PRICELESS!!!!  Having Walter Mathau & Jack Lemen team up to do this comedy not only once but twice is simply sidesplitting.   This is well worth your buy to see for an pair of first rate comedies Another Mill Creek Entertainment buy.  And this is a good one.  While a bit dry, I do enjoy the detailed facts of this documentary set.  If you don't mind it, this is excellent Scream! Factory has done an overall excellent job in restoring & adding extras for films of different qualities across the board.  And Blacula/Scream Blacula Scream is no exception.   I bought this as a present for a person.  The enjoyed it immensly This 12 Film Multi-Pack contains most, if not all films, from Crown International Pictures.  I enjoy most of these on this edition.  Especially ""Prime Eveil"" (really CHEESEY!!!).  Many of these are on other Mill Creek Entertainment multi-packs.   No matter how you slice it, this is a little piece of guilty enjoyment The Anime version of Dante's inferno is a good but interesting watch.  The overall is effect is odd but the moral interpretation is excellent.  Most people might get thrown off a bit by the fact that the movie has differing style of animation.  But it does bring something unique to the Genre. This grab bag of B-Rate cult classics was released by Mill Creek Entertainment in 2010 (it was re-released in smaller packaging).  And I have to say that this is one of their better releases.  The ""Cheese"" is there.  And the overall quality is way better with this particular 12 pack than in others.  On can enjoy this over & over again From Dusk Til Dawn was one of those films where you didn't know wheather to cheer for the vmapires or the good guys in the movie.  The other 2 films are variable compared to the original.  But it is nice to have the entire series on hand. I just purchased this earlier this week & received it earlier today.  I cant WAIT to see all the extra features!  Plus see the extra footage that is included on this.  Even though I am still heartily angry that they didn't end it with Smaug burning the town.  & that I have to wait until the beginning of the 3rd film to see this happen.   But all in all, I am VERY glad I purchased this! Pieces is one of those weird movies.  It is a film from Spain.  And this is an EXCELLENT 2 Blu-Ray, 1 CD set.  They really did an excellent job of restoring the film.  Plus the extras in Blu-Ray are simply phenominal.   Overall this is an excellent Blu-Ray set & is well worth the buy! After buying the 1st Season last year, I found that I enjoyed the show emensly.  I finally bought season 2 yesterday at Wal-Mart for a great price.  Well I have watched 6 out of the 10 episodes so far.  & I am LOVING the second season as much as I loved the first season.  Any who loves fantasy will love Game of Thrones. Mill Creek Entertainment put out a 12 pack around a theme on this one.  I.E. Monsters.  This is one of those times where they have brought together CLASSIC B-rate monsters.  And I LOVE it!  if you are NOT a Fan of these than save your money for something else.  But if you enjoy this kind of fare, this is a themed collection for you I love this 12 movie multi-pack filled with CHEESY low budget B-Rate Films!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Devil In the Flesh 1 & 2, The Ice Cream Man, And more!!!   I love this multi-pack.  But be warned, these movies AREN'T for everyone!  If you aren't a fan of this type of movie, than you might not want to buy this.  But if you do like these, THAN GET THIS IMMEDIATELY! I found this in a Target low price bin & purchased it.  I find this to be a rather unique film.  Mostly because they allowed 26 directors, one for each letter of the alphabet, to do a horror vigniette.  It works VERY well.  They range from Horifying to humourous to downright disgusting.  But it is an overall satisfying horror film. Finally a movie collection that has the ""Gravatas"" to call it like it is.  And that's EXACTLY what you have here, Mill creek Entertainment's The Best of the Worst.  Many of these were in other collections put out by Mill Creek prior to this.  But never in just a collection like this.   So do yourself a favor.  Get this collection, grab your popcorn bucket, and sit down to watch ""The Best Of The Worst"" I just bought this a couple of days ago.  Mostly for ""The Claw""  & ""Mothera"".  And I was not disappointed!  I love the 50ish Sci-Fi Atomic Scare feel of them.  And they really are classics of the Sci-Fi Genre.  And Having 2 Ray Harryhousen classics in this edition is a definate plus! I finally purchased this after seeing the new Godzilla movie.  And these are CLASSIC Japanese giant monster movies!!!  They really cleared up the pictures of these films.  And I really enjoy how these are!   So wheather you are new to the genre or a die hard fan, this is a great product to have! After buying the Gamera: Ultimate Collection Vol. 1, I purchased and watched Vol. 2.  I have never been a HUGE Japanese Mega-Monster fan, I do appreciate these movies.  And am glad that these are in my collection.   So if you are one of those who enjoy this type of film, than having this in your collection, at this price, is nice to have I saw Predator & Predator 2 in Theatres when they origionally came out.  I have been a fan of them both for years. I saw this at Best Buy on sale for $9.99.  I thought, yeah that is a great price!   I love having this Trilogy of movies.  And it is an excellent piece of Sci-Fi & a great addition to my expanded collection. I have been through a V/H/S, DVD, Blu-Ray, & now Scream! Factory's Multi-Format edition.  Scream! Factory's edition has 3 discs, all chock full of extras.  New AND old!!!!!!!  For those of you who love this series, you will LOVE this damn near definitive edition of Army of Darkness!!!   Get a tub of popcorn, your favorite softdrink, your chainsaw, & your S-Mart BOOMSTICK!!  Sit down and enjoy this edition for one of THE best editions around of Army Of Darkness! I had Blade I & II on Blu-Ray.  I decided to get to the trilogy in the slimline case to get all three in one package.  This is really a great trilogy to get.  And Wesly Snipes at his best. It is always great when Disney releases some of it's classic films fromit's movie vaults.  Jungle Book is one of those films from a by-gone era that never seem to get old.  They just don't make cartoon movies like they used to!  The Jungke book on Blu-Ray is a definate plus!  So if you're a fan of Disney Classics, this is one that you need to pick up! Hammer Studios has always been one of the better production studios.  This has 4 of their CLSSIC Horror films.  Brilliant restoration of the Picture & Sound on all of these.  Excellently done.   My only real complaint, they didn't put any extras.   But It is REALLY worth the purchase! I have been a Mill Creek Entertainment fan for many years now.  I have several of their Movie Multipacks & Documentary Sets.  When I saw this was comming out, I said I HAD to buy this!  I was again pleased by my purchase of this documentary set by them.   This is well worth your money to have this set I have the original Don't Look In The Basement in a collector's tin collection of DVD's.  Having it on Blu-Ray is Excellent!!!  I was amazed that they were able to transfer it so well.  And having it packaged with the more recent sequel was very nice. Cat 'O Nine Tails is one of Argento's very early works. Arrow Video, as usual,  did an excellent job of not only picture restoration,  but of just adding all the extras. Slither is one of those films that has elements of Sci-fi,  comedy,  and horror all mixed together.  But it somehow makes all those work to make one great movie!!! It horrified me as much as it makes me laugh.   And Scream! Factory has mad a great edition with all the goodies and extras I am not the biggest fan of Donnie Darko. But I liked it enough to get Arrow Video's set. Let me tell you something,  even a ok fan like me can tell you that this is THE definitive edition of this cult classic.  Arrow Video really went out of its way to present all cuts of this movie. And of course pack it with all those nice extras Mill Creek Entertainment has made its mark in putting out Inexpensive Multi-Packs of movies.  And this 20 Pack is chock full of B-Rate films to do several Mystery Science Theatre episodes.  One should be able to enjoy many of these obscure genre classics. Mill Creek released this multipack of Cautionary Tales in 2006.  Many of these were made as cautionary films to ward away the usage of a particular drug or from doing a particular lifestyle.   Unfortunately, these come out a silly rather than being able to take the content seriously.  These really are gems of ways NOT to perform a cautionary tale. I found this low budget gem in a movie rack for $3.  I wound up buying it on a whim & wound up enjoying it.  This anthology movie works well and the acting is pretty good for a low budget film.  And lets face it, having Adam West in it definately makes it worthwhile to watch.   Overall this is a well made low budget anthology film. The title of this is really a bit of a Misnomer.  Whill this multi-pack has thriller movies in it, it has other movies in it that aren't so thriller oriented.  Basically this multipack is an excellent way to spend an evening watching 1970's & early 1980's low budget films.   While not the greatest movies, they are worthwhile to watch.  And are, to a large extent, entertaining to watch This collectable tin & the Death Scream tin make the perfect complementary pair.  Yes the Movies are low budget, cult classic, B to Z rate films.  But how could one NOT like ""House by the Cemetary""?  Or ""The Hatchet Murders""?  If you are a true Horror afficinado, you have to take the good with the bad.  And these are so bad they are good Ok, this is a compilation of 20 low budget Vampire films.  Are they all good?  No.  Are there enough good ones to keep a person interested to watch them?  Yes!  Talk about an ORGY of Vampires!!   If you like Vampire Films & don't mind low budget films.  This is the set for you! I won't say that all of these are good.  But I won't say that I dislike any of these either.  Mostly this brings together a group of movies with a common theme.  I.E. low Budget movies that have actresses that either were Big Screen stars or women that were on their way to becomming Big Screen Stars.  Either way, this is a nice little collection to have around This is a grab bag of low budget action thrillers.  If one enjoys this kind of fare, than this is for you.  Not much in the ""Cheese"" factor that I like, but you know, one can't complain about the price nor the said low budget action I have been a fan of Mill Creek Entertainment for around 4 years now.  I purchased the ""End Of The World"" Documentary set at one of my favorite haunts about 2 years ago.  I enjoy most of the documentaries in this set.  Although some of them are quite hokey.  If nothing else, at the price they are selling it at, it really is a steal for all of these Dangerous Babes is another ""Themed"" 12 pack of movies by the ever popular Mill Creek Entertainment.  This one, like their Big Screen Bombshells film set, is centered around low budget, woman oriented films.  And most aren't that bad.  I do recommend this one.  If only just because many of these are pretty good for Low Budget You know, Mill Creek Entertainment has another winner here.  Anatomy & Anatomy 2 are German made horror movies.  These are concerning renegade doctors of the ""Anti-Hypocratic"" Society who feel that the Hypocratic oath of the medical field holds medical science back.   The real terror here is, the movies make it seem plausibly real.  I will hand it to the Germans for making me feel scared of doctors over this one. Leave it to the real masters of Horror.  This two pack from Mill Creek Entertainment delivers a great pair of low budget but great pair of old horror films.  I really liked the feel & atmosphere of these two movies.  If you want an effective scare from when Horror delivered without all the gore & nudity, these are it! Like their other 16 film collection, this gives a pretty good spread of the ""Sword & Sandle"" Genre.  While I am not a HUGE fan, or even a fan, by any streach of the imagination, it is nice to have these around for a change of pace. Like Mill Creek Entertainment's Dead Of Night 20 movie Collection, this one is simply a re-named Sci-Fi Fever.  Most of these are B-Rate Sci-Fi Films.  Cheesy or not, these films are worth at least a once through I Like Aliens.  I like Cowboys.  And Cowboys AND Aliens are EVEN BETTER!!!!!  Aliens in the Wild, Wild West was REALLy cheeseball but likeable.  Oblivian & Oblivian 2 are the real gems in this set.  Overall a great set of movies I have had this classic for a while. I finally broke down and bought the limited edition. One of 3000. I am VERY glad I bought it. The only downside is the lack of extras. But just the improvement in picture quality is excellent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A1IL9EYL8SKSPT," I was alive when this was made, so I should love it ... but stilted performances. Still, you need to watch it because not only is it of its time, it is worth your time. And Nicholson and Bergen are young, feeling their way, not sure about their lines. Compare it to their later work. Is this worse than Moonraker - Bond in space? No. Is it worse than A View to a Kill - Bond having sex with Grace Jones and killing Christopher Walken? No. But Daniel Craig is a better Bond, as is Sean Connery. Rent or buy those instead. At 106 minutes, it is overlong, and Dyan Cannon is wooden. I expected more, but on the other hand, it is 60s canon. See what I did there? Watch it, if only for the period feel. Like Kaiju? This is your movie. Large rubbery monsters attack major world capitals, Gojira shows up, and mankind, who thought they had the monsters corralled in Monsterland, pays the price. Not as good as the original 50s Gojira, better than Matthew Broderick's Godzilla (but then, what wasn't?) and it's a totally different animal than the recent Godzilla with Bryan Cranston. The 2014 Godzilla is a decent enough movie, but you go away wanting more monster screen time. Enjoy! This is Brosnan's best James Bond film - the others were not so good. Brosnan had creative control over this movie, and it shows. It's a great ride. Buy it and watch it again and again. I will. This movie was just dumb, as a crocodile that bothered almost no one is hunted - Bridget Fonda phoning it in, and no chemistry with Bill Pullman. But Betty White curses a lot, so that alone might be worth a watch. Oh, and Oliver Platt plays a character you can easily hate. It's satirical, and the female cast is strong - the plot is all over the place, but there are two more GS movies, and I'm in for the duration. Watch it in the spirit it's intended - a coming of age tale with lots of corpses. Kevin Spacey does his own singing and dancing, the story moves along nicely, and while it's not completely accurate, it hits the high points of Bobby Darin's life. Watched it a second time so my SigOther could see it, and it was worth every minute. Kristanna Loken and Ben Kingsley? I went in with high hopes. This movie is bad - half vampires and silly vendettas. Did Ben Kingsley owe the producer money? Did someone have a photo of him with a live girl or a dead boy? I love studio movies that are so bad they're good (Sucker Punch is s***e, but funny) but this is just plain awful. I'll give the DVD away, or chuck it out the window. What else is there to say? The follow on movie to Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later - if you like zombie apocalypse stories, you will love this. It's the Walking Dead on steroids. This horror movie is OK, it's got a couple good scares. The pacing is OK, but you'll have to suspend disbelief when you see the giant apartment/darkroom in Tokyo that the American couple is given to live in ... no one but a Tokyo billionaire has that much room! Adapted from the Japanese original, this movie really takes you there - I'm hard to scare, but I was really taken in. Naomi Watts is excellent as always, and the rest of the cast is good. Turn off all the lights, and turn off your phone. Compelling story - based on a true one - good action, good drama, and it shows the real life struggle of Jews relentlessly pursued by soldiers who have been ordered to kill them. Life and death drama - watch it. What can you say? It's a Sam Raimi horror movie. It's got a curse in it. It's got his '73 Olds Delta 88 in it. A good way to pass 99 minutes, but nothing special to report. I loved this movie. The sets are great, and the restaurant scene was shot at La Couronne, the restaurant where Julia had her first meal in France. I'm going to dig out my Mastering the Art of French cooking and get back in the kitchen. Megan Fox can act - who knew? She is very good in this, as is Amanda Seyfreid. The story is disjointed, the motivations unclear, but the lead actors turn in solid performances, and it's just ... fun. This wasn't as good as I Spit on Your Grave (1978) (which Roger Ebert thought the worst movie ever made) but it's still revenge horror if that's your thing. Definitely adults only. Oh, and the I Spit on Your Grave (2010) remake? A really good movie. Priest, vampires, a missing girl - we've seen these plot points before. But it's difficult to determine motivation or any reason for the lead actors to do what they're doing. Watch The Exorcist instead, or any of the movies where Anthony Hopkins is a priest and there's a demon involved. Tyler Perry - this should have been bad. But the characters are all real and well thought out, everyone has a motivation, and the stories are interesting. If you decide to watch one Tyler Perry movie, watch this. Or if you want action, Alex Cross. I usually dislike sitcom-type shows, but this had me from scene one. The two writers are British, which helps, and for someone who has never seen an episode of Friends, Matt LeBlanc is very engaging. Kristanna Loken and Ben Kingsley? I went in with high hopes. This movie is bad - half vampires and silly vendettas. Did Ben Kingsley owe the producer money? Did someone have a photo of him with a live girl or a dead boy? I love studio movies that are so bad they're good (Sucker Punch is s***e, but funny) but this is just plain awful. I'll give the DVD away, or chuck it out the window. This is like Groundhog day, but a drama. The government keeps sending the protagonist back in time to prevent a bombing. It's a pretty good time travel movie - not as good as Looper, but worth a watch. And Vera Farmiga is very good in it. It's fun to watch this, then watch the French original. Rent 'em both, then watch them back-to-back ... the differences are plain to see. Wooden performances in ... guess which one? This is the best racing movie I've ever seen, and that includes LeMans. Ron Howard did an outstanding job bringing these outsize personalities to life. Even if you've never heard of F1 racing, watch this movie. Eva Green was in Casino Royale (best Bond film ever) and Timothy Dalton had 2 (good I thought) Bond films. That was enough for me - and both lead actors deliver. This is a bit of horror, a bit of drama, and a lot of period costumes. I love it. Only watched it because Sarah Butler was in it - it was long even for a movie barely over an hour. Tired premise, unimaginative writing. It is a movie for a rainy afternoon when you have nothing - and I mean no thing - to do. Sure the critics hated it, sure it is a bit formulaic - bad things happen in the house of the first victim - but it has some really good scares in it. The mood is set well - whomever lit this movie deserves credit. A bit overlong, but worth a watch. The movie was not what I expected - Act 3 was missing, and the ending was not what I wanted, but on the other hand, that doesn't happen often. Watch it if for no other reason than the performance of the little girl, Kashish, who played Salomina. True, I will watch Benedict Cumberbatch do anything, but this special - the tale of Alan Turing is fascinating, as is the way his government treated him after he'd saved them from the Nazis. Watch this. Jon Stewart steps outside his metier here, with wonderful results. This documentary shows the results of letting religious zealots take over your country. It is a wake up call for all of us. I used to lump Witherspoon in with actors like Drew Barrymore and Kate Hudson. No range, no reason to watch their movies. But Reese won me over with this - she's raw, in danger, and completely believable in this role. I am totally on board. I used to lump Witherspoon in with actors like Drew Barrymore and Kate Hudson. No range, no reason to watch their movies. But Reese won me over with this - she's raw, in danger, and completely believable in this role. I am totally on board. I have never seen an episode of Friends. Horrible Bosses was OK, but I was still reluctant to watch anything with Jennifer Aniston in it. This movie turned me around like Wild did with Reese Witherspoon. There is real serious acting here - she commits, and she won me over. I bought this movie. So there. Be well aware - I like revenge horror. The 2010 remake of I Spit on You Grave is fantastic. This movie is not quite as good but it quite watchable. The second 'remake,' set in Bulgaria, isn't all that good, but watch it if you're an ISOYG completist like me. Not only is Barry Crimmins a great comic and humanist, he's an adult survivor of abuse. His take on his and others ordeals at the hands of the Catholic church comes through the lens of his comedy. This is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. The blacklist was an incredibly big issue, and this movie shows the ugliest side of it. Bryan Cranston is incredibly good in this role - hard to see anyone else playing Trumbo. And, for comparison, there's another excellent blacklist movie - The Front (Zero Mostel, Woody Allen). We have to remain vigilant - this sort of thing must never happen again. It is ashtonishing what Welles could do with a simple one shot - presumably it is not even cut together like he wanted, yet the black and white footage is amazing. Sad that they took this and other things away from him. The triple bill is intriguing, but Island is bonkers (and Marlon Brado is bad in it) and Dark City is a montage of scenes that don't come together. The Hidden? Probably not going to watch it given the other 2 movies on the DVD. An artist inspired by a crazy man who makes her inhale smoke from some sap coming from a branch that is ... ancient? OK, I'm in - if only for the lead actress transforming into the villain. She is the protagonist from hell. Typical lost in the woods drama - gritty, sexy at points, and a tale of a sister trying to make things OK for her siblings. The kid who plays the main heroine early in her life is one to watch. She stole every scene she was in .... The script is not good, the story line is weak, and even at just 85 minutes, it seems overlong. Can't someone do AI right? Ex Machina (at least for me) was boring, and AI was just bad - saw it in a theater, and people booed at the end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A27GY3X9Q348ZR," If you can't go to the beach this summer. This story tells you what you about the vacation struggles you are avoiding by staying home. By the way tell your family you love them. Need a time out from all the hum-drum that can get you down. This is a great pick me up. Everyone needs a Conehead in their life. Some people may like ""fried embryos"" or drinks by the"" six-pack."" I swear I have a friend who smokes like Beldar, a whole pack at a time. What fun. This is a great movie this version is so much better then the newer version. This movie was made back when an actor really sunk themselves into the character. Obviously characters are well portrayed. The story line kept at a certain pace without falling down. This movie is so funny I had forgotten about it ,when it eased it's way back into my memory I knew I had to have it. I think it is absolutely hysterical. The kids dressing up as Tribal people is the best part of the movie, nest would have to be at the end with Richard Drefuss tribal costume. Jenna Elfman is a cute female tribal member. This is a great movie this version is so much better then the newer version. This movie was made back when an actor really sunk themselves into the character. Obviously characters are well portrayed. The story line kept at a certain pace without falling down. I accidentally ordered this instead of the original. It gives a fresh view and story to a great play. It is likeable and the girl who plays Lucy is adorable, although she is now an adult. I bought this combination because I like Groundhog Day a lot. Ghostbusters is also good. But Stripes is so old, and a very strong men's movie. My husband was not interested in it either. If you follow Captn. Mcrae and Captn. Call from Lonesome Dove, then you will enjoy the view of their earlier years.  I like westerns and they don't have to have the Duke to be enjoyable. If you follow Captn. Mcrae and Captn.

A3SKZ041H14I5H," It was very good for the time, and it's still entertaining, but not up to standards of the time, although I don't think it would be very successful nowadays.  I loved at the time and I'm happy to have the Blu Ray as a souvenir.  i re-watched it the other day with my friend Peter Stampfel's song in it called ""If Ya Wanna be a Bird."" Perfect!  It was a sequel to ""2001, A Space Odyssey.""  The original author wrote two more sequels before he died, which haven't been made into movies yet.  This was a great movie, a new Blu-Ray at a great price. I saw this as a play when it was new in Hollywood. Tim Curry was the lead in the play on Sunset strip, and when it was made into a movie, he stood in a bookshop next to the theatre giving autographs.  He did a lot of movies afterward, and i'd wish he'd still do move. I remember seeing this movie in the early 60's, shortly after seeing ""Ben Hur,"" where they would not show the face of Jesus.  I loved King of Kings, but the actor who played Jesus died shortly afterward.  But nowadays, there's no block of showing Jesus in full, and I assume the new Ben Hur movie will show him. Other than some minor roles, this is the first time Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone worked together in lead roles.  Their ability to work together considering all the years that they were rivals is purely riveting.  I hope they do more! I watched the cartoons when i was young, and i was incredibly surprised by the quality of the movie.  I recommend it to everyone, but especially those of my age who remember the cartoons.  it's fabulous with a great story.  i hope there will be sequals. Anyone who loved the door, will love this show.  His father, Admiral George Morrison, spoke to defend him until he died in 2008 at the age of 90.  There have always been rumors that Jim Morrison never died in Paris. I didn't go see it in the theater, since I thought it was fairly un-storied.  But it was really fascinating, and I've got the Blu-Ray and watched it over and over. I didn't go see it in the theater, since I thought it was fairly un-storied.

There are practically no articles about Jesus as a kid in the Bible, yet I know this is a true story! I remember seeing this shortly after the newest ""Titanic"" movie was released and won ""Best Movie.""  It's great showing the Titanic under the Atlantic Ocean, and with Leonard Nimoy, who we all miss, doing the explaining.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2P0HOZFUZM3JK," Great Stuff. Wish there were some good extras but the picture and the sound are great. They don't make movies like these anymore. Too bad this isn't widely available on blu ray. this is just a classic 80s teen flick with a good cult following. tries to be ramantic but is silly. just about some friends trying to get some, and someones bound o get hurt. Come to think of it a little too realistic! watch, laugh and think/ Did this remind u of anyone??? theres nothing to say but Episode 66: Hush A group of murderous creatures straight out of a fairy tale steal away the townspeople's voices one of the best thing i ever saw on TV. i just hope like the european version of season 4 one of the special features is the making of the HUSH episode. Worth the money alone for this episode This is a wonderful and interesting documentary about a family who are in England and take a challenge to spend time in a house acting like they are living in 1900. They go through many emotional times and its very interesting to see how things were back then. Make sure u see this fun and interesting 3 part (i think) dvd. i just wish i knew if there were any extras or updates on this fun family! there aren't many horror movies to come out since the 80s that can come close to classic but this one does. Alot smarter than some of the 80s movies (with exception of Elm Streets firsts) with a good story line. The gore is top notch, the acting is good enough and its SEE IT AGAIN value very high. Sit back, clear yor mind and have fun with this new classic! Dont forget the tons of INFINIFILM extras also People the movie was nominated for an academy award for best foreign language film which means IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE. anyway movie was great. the end was kind of shocking. you don't see that kind of thing normally happen in a movie. i won't say what in case people who haven't seen it yet. Great blend of fantasy and harsh reality being seen from a childs eyes. would someone please explain this movie to me. utterly rediculous, and then the movie ends without ever explaining anything that you wonder about through the whole movie!!! theres no way people like this movie other than the fact of some cute gusy running around. GARBAGE!! sometimes i wonder if people ever really watch scary movies when they say this was sooooo scary. It was ok. Doesnt really do anything and ends with one of those (i wanna break my tv) endings. watch if you are bored but don't rush out to rent or buy it considering this is a 70d flick its still quite creepy and the sound and video quality of the dvd is great. One wonders why Linda Blair ever dissapeared from the screen. she is always so good to watch and such a natural actress so what was the big deal about this movie? yes the acting is fine and the story is ok, but shocking and contraversial? yes somewhat but nothing that amazing. Compared to the movie Priest which was out a few years before, this is alot tamer. Watch out for the Magdalene Sisters which is coming to theathers this year for more contraversy. realeasing this before the classics is absurd This group was the phoniest most unlikeable. Watching the Real World since the 1st season this is the first time i stopped watching because the cast was soooo overly dramatic, and looking constantly for attention, and forever complaining and arguing but at the end the usual ""We love each other so much"" lie. Gimme a break! The same old stuff! Dizzying camera work, horrible audio and that ending that always pisses you off. If this was not a FOUND FOOTAGE/LIVE CAMERA kind of movie and was an actual movie probably would have been a lot better.

The story is cool and interesting....I think this movie comes before the Walking Dead and all the new zombie world movies.....Among the best from Will with Independence Day and the Men in Black ones!!!! The Dark Knight, in my opinion, is BY FAR the best movie from Batman ever created....The previous one, Batman Begins is really good too, but this one got the Joker....Batman got really cool enemies, but the Joker must be the coolest of all....Dark Knight also is the darkest of all Batman films....man, if you like Batman you just got to see Dark Knight!!!!GREAT MOVIE!!!Well done, Batman!!!

The first Matrix become a huge classic from the late 90's, but i think the 2nd part Reloaded is the best.....Revolutions, the conclusion is non stop battle with a cool end....Matrix is a great trilogy and i highly recommend Matrix for sci fi lovers all over this reality!!! O, well....If you expect a brilliant, original and inspired movie, you may think Tomb Raider is way too shallow and predictable.....But if you want a action movie full of fast scenes, where you don't have to think and like Angelina Jolie's beauty, you may enjoy this Tomb Raider....Man, Angelina is highly beautiful and the movie is ok!!! The Silence of the Lambs is one of the coolest action suspense movies EVER!!!! This is really a classic with superb acting from Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster!!!!

Congratulations,Carlos Saldanha....The ICE AGE movies are fantastic, and now RIO shines too!!!!! WELL DONE!!!!BRAVO!!!!!!!! This is without any doubt the worst movie from the Scream saga.....The first Scream is great, the second one is very good and the third is good....This one is unnecessary for the Scream saga..... YEAH!!!BRAVO!!! Finally they did a great solid trilogy from the coolest hero ever, Gothan's Dark Knight BATMAN.....Batman Begins, Dark Knight and this one are great movies, creating a more realistic Batman in a dark atmosphere....I like the old ones with Jack Nicholson, Jim Carrey and Penguin, but those are way too childish movies....The new trilogy show a more real Gothan and the new characters are simply perfect....I really enjoy it...If you like Batman, you should check this!!! YES!!!YES!!! DESOLATION OF SMAUG is one of the best from LORD OF RINGS HOBBIT journey!!!! Way way better than the first HOBBIT movie!!!! What a great great saga is this....AMAZING MOVIE!!!!TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!! THE HOBBIT is a good movie, moving on the great LORD OF RINGS saga....I don't put this movie on the high level of the first 3 fantastic movies, because i think there's some parts that could be  more dynamic, but there's some MAGIC images through all the story!!!! GOOD MOVIE!!!!!!!!! Bunraku is a great, colourful, raw and unknown action movie with a AMAZING HQ visual and nice acting from some great actors!!!! One of the best action movies from these years!!!Well done!!! Spirit of Vengeance is a AMAZING action movie based in the highly cool Ghost Rider....The Ghost Rider character is really cool in this movie....The visual effects are insane and the Rider is way more raw and dark here....I really enjoy this brutal dark raw Ghost Rider!!!!One of the BEST from the DC MARVEL movies!!!! There are lots of movies with the same story of THE DEVIL INSIDE, but in my opinion this one is really scarry with a really cool end.....Its a short movie, and the story flows quickly with some good effects....well, i liked this movie.....it's really scarry!!!! The Madagascar trilogy is one of the best animated sagas EVER created!!! The characters are great, the visual is incredible and the story is really funny, not only for kids!!! Besides the katy perry song, Madagascar 3 is totally great and highly recommended!!!! well, this is really the end of the great ALIEN SAGA.....i really like the first 3 ALIEN movies.....They are TOTAL classics, with great stories and AMAZING scenes in the space.....this one, PROMETHEUS is TOTALLY disgusting!!!!! There's some really sick scenes through ALL the movie, and the story is completely uninspired.....stick with the original first 3 ones....maybe the RESURRECTION one, but stay away from this disgusting NO STORY movie!!!!! BLERRRRGH!!!! Rise of the Guardians is a great animated movie full of colours and action!!!! The graphics are incredible, the story is nice and the cast of voices is first class!!! Highly recommended!!!! Ice Age : Continental Drift is another great animated movie from the Ice Age saga.....The graphics are only getting better and better with each movie, and the characters are inspired, great and funny....Really funny and highly beautiful images!!!! Elite Squad(Tropa de Elite) was a great Brazilian movie that made huge success with lots of action and brutality....This 2nd one in my opinion is even better than the first....The story is highly interesting, the bad guys here are cooler and Wagner Moura(best Brazilian actor EVER!)shine with brilliant performance....Highly recommended!!!! Great action movie!!!! But see the first one before watch this one, so you can understand the whole plot!!!! Besides the fact that the ware wolves, in fact are giant wolves, and the vampires are way too sensible and kind, i really enjoyed the TWILIGHT SAGA....The saga is a bit childish, but the story of the girl's love between a vampire and a ware wolf as a whole is great!!!!! just 1 fact that's embarrassing here is the Brazilian Indians speaking a perfect English....but, as a whole, the TWILIGHT SAGA is great!!!!!! The Croods is one of the BEST animated movies EVER!!!! The graphics are incredible, beautiful and colourful....The story is nice with great job from Nicolas Cage as the voice of Grug....I really enjoy The Croods and i'm not a kid!!!! Highly Recommended if you like high class graphics!!!! Try the Blu ray version for some out of this world images!!!!! Ok, this movie is a mix of many other great Sci Fi movies in one, but its full of action and great visual effects all over!!!! Will and his son are great actors and did a great movie!!!! Recommended!!! Very good movie with a great cast of actors....Like other reviews said, the movie is a bit slow and they really could put more Bill Murray scenes....But a very interesting story!!!! Like many other reviews, i grow with the old Smurfs cartoons, and i think the first The Smurfs is really good, and entertaining for adults too....This one is just too much....Too much Smurfs for sure.....Stick with the first one!!!!!! This GODZILLA from 2014 is the definitive movie from the great beast GODZILLA!!!!!! The story is highly cool and the Godzilla MUTU monsters visual are AMAZING!!!! I totally recommend this GODZILLA 2014!!!!! WAY WAY better than old GODZILLA films!!!! This is one of the best series EVER, one of my dearest favourites shows....REALLY REALLY FUNNY and INSPIRED!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED if you like SIMPSONS and FAMILY GUY...........WELL DONE, AL and FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I like this movie from the creator of the hilarious Family Guy and American Dad....I think theres some jokes and dialogues that could be easily be left out of the movie, but after all you got many laughs! If you like the politically incorrect way of Family Guy, you may like this one! I really like most all the cartoon classics from Disney, and i think this is the one....The best of all!!!! The little Mermaid and Aladdin are great too, but the Lion King is just something unique!!!! The Blu Ray version adds a lot too.....Highly recommended movie!!!! The first Dumb and Dumber is a total classic comedy from the 90s.....One of the funniest movies i ever seen.....For my surprise, 20 years later they create another great great politically incorrect comedy masterpiece.....I don't understand so many bad reviews for this funny movie....Highly recommended if you like the first one!!! Amazing Brutal movie!!!!!One of the best movies with Keanu Reeves, and maybe his most brutal one!!!! If you love dogs like me, theres some brutality with a cute beagle (i got a lovely beagle too, so that disturbs me!!!!).....but overall, this is one of the best high intense brutal movies of the last years(The Equalizer, with Denzel is a great brutal too)!!!!Highly recommended!!!!!! Wow!!! This kind of slow motion movie is the highest form of art ever created!!!! Takes a lot of time and patience to produce such a glorious masterpiece like Shaun the Sheep....The story is fun, but what deserves attention is the absurd incredible visual of this movie!!!!! If you like Chicken Run and Pirates, you really should check Shaun the Sheep!!! The first Mad Max is great....Road Warrior is the best.....This one in my opinion, is better than Beyond Thunderdome.....The movie  starts in high speed, with lots of amazing action on a cool lost world.....The story is not so great, but just for the cool visual of the lost world and the many great action scenes, this one deserves a look and 5 stars.... The first Mad Max is great....Road Warrior is the best.....This one in my opinion, is better than Beyond Thunderdome.....The movie  starts in high speed, with lots of amazing action on a cool lost world.....The story is not so great, but just for the cool visual of the lost world and the many great action scenes, this one deserves a look and 5 stars.... One BRAVO for each LORD OF THE RINGS movie of the original trilogy!!!! The 3 together are one of the coolest, most magic and beautiful sagas of all time!!!! The world of wizards, trolls, elves and warriors on the movie is like a perfect visual dream!!!!! what can i say......LORD OF THE RINGS RULES!!!!! YEAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a very good movie from the Watchmen! The soundtrack is great, the story is nice and the characters are just like in the comics!!! Watchmen is pretty cool, like a fusion between Batman, Wolverine and Justice League!!! Highly recommended for action comic book movie lovers all around the Earth!!!!!!!! The Revenant is a modern masterpiece....DiCaprio got some great movies like Inception, Shutter Island, Blood Diamonds and Django, but i think this is his masterpiece....Thats why he got his deserved oscar for Revenant....The movie is brutal and raw, but also meaningful and true.....Amazing!!!! One of the best movies ever!!! One BRAVO for each LORD OF THE RINGS movie of the original trilogy!!!! The 3 together are one of the coolest, most magic and beautiful sagas of all time!!!! The world of wizards, trolls, elves and warriors on the movie is like a perfect visual dream!!!!! what can i say..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
...LORD OF THE RINGS RULES!!!!! YEAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! Its not for this movie plot, or for the new cast of actors.....but you cant really compare this Addams Family Reunion with the previous 2 AMAZING Family Addams movies!!! The Gomez here is ok, but the one Raul Julia create is PERFECT!!!! The uncle Fester of Christopher Loyd is PERFECT too.....To conclude, Addams Family Reunion is not a bad movie, but the previous 2 are way way way way way better!!!!! I don't know why, but Cidade Baixa(Lower City) is one of my favourite movies made in Brazil....The story is raw and show a dark Salvador, far away from the light of carnaval....Very good movie!! Amazing live show from Nirvana!!!!I Nirvana live performances are way more powerful and cooler than what they sound in their great albums....The songs from Bleach, Nevermind and Incesticide are rawer and the band sound like a hallucinated Punk Metal bomb!!!! If you only know Nirvana for their albums, you just gotta see this Live at Reading stuff....Amazing!!!! This show turn me back in to a Huge Nirvana fan, like when i was a kid!!!! Nirvanas live shows are just great!!!! These guys sound like a insane Punk Metal band in their live performances!!!! If you like the album versions for their songs," you gotta check their live stuff!!!!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1EMDSTJDUE6B0," The special effects were really touted as being top-notch. I beg to differ. I think they were just okay. They were better on a large screen in the theater, but still not great. The story, although fairly well known, is still pretty captivating. The romance factor is not overdone, so it is tolerable for even most hardened viewers. Still, it may be a tear-jerker for some, making it a good ""date"" movie. If you are a serious movie lover, you must see this movie.  The DVD  transfer is very good, and you'll see facial expression details that could  not be seen on VHS (even with the best equipment).  END This is an excellent movie. It may not be to everyone's taste, but if you like ""High Fidelity"", you will probably like this movie. There is enough action, drama and comedy to keep your attention. What is the big attraction, though, is getting inside the lives and minds of the people. The acting is very good, the sound is good, cinematography is good (for an urban setting). Overall, excellent. This is a good movie and the DVD transfer is good. Nothing great. Nowhere in the same league as ""Reservoir Dogs"" or even ""Pulp Fiction"" (slightly different genre), in terms of story, soundtrack or transfer. Great to have all in one place. Even better is having both versions. Some of the enhancements are improvements, some are not but even those aren't terrible. And it's only a click away to the original version.  The menu navigation is a little cumbersome, but OK after a while. This is a good flick, although it may seem slightly aged since all the others in the genre have beaten the genre to death (Kill Bill breathed a breath of fresh air into it). Good acting, somewhat predictable, but not overdone with violence or gore. Kept me watching. This is a nail-biter of a movie. There are many points that keep you on the edge of your sear, er, cliff. The cinematography is excellent and so is the acting. Although the setting is snow-covered mountains, it is viewable any time of the year (watching during a snow storm is especially gripping). This is better than many of the summer block-buster movies we have seen in the past ten years, so give it a try. This is mediocre, at best. Watchable, yes, with children, but just barely. The plot is very predictable. The ending is weak. The effects are marginal (some are downright bad). The editing is not very good, either. If it weren't a serious attempt, it almost could be a classic late night show (which is not always a good thing). Pass this one by. When I originally saw this in the theaters (opening week, of course), I was somewhat disappointed.  When it came out on DVD, I rented it and liked it better.  I bought the DVD and have viewed it several times since then.  Each time I like it better.  There is much more to the story than meets the eye (and Jar-Jar gets less annoying).  Although the transfer isn't the greatest, it is still good and better than some theaters. This movie was the training ground for Denzel Washington's ""Training Day"". He breaks away from ""Pelican Brief"" (calm, cool, collected but fast acting) and bares his emotional side -- to great effect. Gene Hackman does equally well, but that can be expected from an excellent seasoned professional. The suspense turns on a dime many times, making for a combination of ""Hunt for Red October"" and ""Top Gun"". The transfer to DVD is excellent. This is a high-tech spy movie that is very good. Cruise puts in one of his best performances and the other actors perform excellently. There is enough variety to keep some suspense going. There is certainly enough action, without having to resort to blow up everything in sight (like some other ""summer"" blockbusters). The transfer to DVD is excellent and the other sound and editing are very good. This DVD pales by comparison to ""Saving Private Ryan"".  It tries to philosophize too much -- as if it were giving second graders morality lessons.  Because of this, it was painfully slow to view.  The transfer is  good, but not great. The movie is a 5-star in its own right, but I'm mostly comparing the quality between Blu-Ray and DVD. The detail is great! Lettering, tire treads, car grills, road texture, horizons, you name it. Yep, the Blu-Ray (BD) is worth it here. This is a good film, at least one where we did not feel our money was wasted (as is the case with 90% of the films). The acting is very good, the effects are convincing and not overdone, the plot is somewhat predictable but never laborious. All in all, a good film, and one to enjoy with your significant other or with older family members. Mediocre -- not bad, not great. Was watchable, though, unlike many war movies that are as bad as the zillion horror copycats. The plot is thin, the climax is okay, there are no real war scenes (except the dogfight and its side effects). The humanity (!) during war was probably better than most -- it is not even permitted in most war movies. The editing is good. This is a great movie.  Definitely 5 stars.  The DVD transfer is excellent.  ""The Thin Red Line"" pales by comparison (I gave it 3 stars).  I won't say anymore to spoil it -- this will be in the top 100 of  this century. Decent movie for kids and is entertaining for adults as well (which has been a good trend for the past five years or so). The plot is simple and the jokes are clean and funny. The lighting / shadows of the animation is very good, especially seeing the sunrises and sunsets that are some of the best that I have seen. The transfer to DVD is fine. Pretty good flick. This is great for kids 7-12. Heck, it is great for us adults, too! Plenty of action that is just a little violent, but clean language and generally good-guy-bad-guy is easy to spot. The creations of Floop are great and Floop's transition to a good guy is really great for developing minds. Have your kids watch it ... and you watch it, too! Yes, this is an old movie. It barely cuts it for me. The romance is drawn out and there is only about 30 seconds of soundtrack played over and over and over again. The acting is marginal. The story is intriguing, but the ending is frustrating. Sure, it is an ""open"" ending, but for a movie of this genre? ""Blue Star"". The words will ring like ""Rose Bud"". Something that propels a person to heights of success then plummets to career failure.... This is a ""real life"" presentation that is worth multiple viewings. This is an excellent video. Sure, most of it is 2000 or earlier, but they are great plays. My 11 year old son, who plays basketball, and I enjoyed watching it. We both talked about strategy, team play, and other stuff stemming from the video (lots of pausing). Great way to introduce the heroes and history of the sport. This was a good, uplifting movie.  It will be most appreciated by those with children or considering having children.  It is slightly slow at times and somewhat predictable, but it is done in a pleasing way.  Cage is good at showing genuine struggles with the issues.  The transfer to DVD is fine. While I gave volume 1 a 4-star, this only gets a 3-star rating. Substandard for this director. Okay, it may be better than other directors, but if I am watching a movie largely based on the director, I don't want to be disappointed. Basically, if you happened on volume 1, you should watch volume 2. Otherwise, keep moving. This is a watchable movie, but nothing special. The cover is deceiving -- it makes it look like yet-another Vietnam movie. Instead, it is more of a mix between a terrorist and a drug-war movie. Too simplistic to say much more. This is a decent flick, but nothing special. Nothing really sticks out. The acting is good, the filming is good, the plot is thin. Something to watch with popcorn on the off-season for TV. Usually that would get three stars, but it was suspenseful enough to get four stars. This is an excellent family film. From the title, I passed on it the first couple times. Then, our son wanted me to watch it, so I did. Very good stuff. It is geared towards 8-13 year olds, but good for the whole family. Teaches many basic life handling situations without being judgmental or in your face. Certainly enough action to keep everyone watching. This was a good movie. I have been shy of pirate movies because many of them are done so poorly. This one is good. It keeps your attention, even for a longer-than-average movie, makes you laugh and is easy on the eyes. Definitely more creative and better effects than other recent attempts. This was decent. It got into the character some more, but the plot was fairly predictable. The graphics were pretty good and the acting was okay. Would recommend only if you had seen the first one and want to see the sequal. This was a little weird, but good. You might have to force yourself to get through the first 15 or 20 minutes, but then things pick up and fall into place. It is a little like ""Memento"" and others of that genre. Not too predictable. Carrey is at one of his finest points, which surprised me. Questionable for dates, but good movie for (stable) couples. This is not your typical football movie, but probably one of the more realistic ones. Okay, except for all the high school players looking like college players (yes, even for great teams in Texas). Many of the events are very realistic, at least for most of us. I thought this was very good, certainly good for a night's entertainment. I thought both Cruise and Foxx were good, but probably not for a nomination (must be a slow year in movies). Cruise has his ""Mission:Impossible"" mode and Foxx changes from a waddling to active state back to waddling, but you always want him to pull through. When I first heard about this movie, it sounded corny. I'm not into tear-jerkers. This didn't become that, although it's close.  Yes, it's somewhat typical and predictable for a movie reminding us what the important things in life are. But, it does it in such a good way, that it's worth viewing.  A couple big names thrown in, but the whole cast is very good. They emotionally buy into it, which makes it more real. The best thing about this movie may be the different perspective that it gives. It does not give the overly romantic view like ""Field of Dreams"" does (but it still is a five-star movie in its own right). It gives a much more realistic view of challenges, victory, defeat, relationships and so on. Very little goes to show how great Mickey Mantle really was, but we get a pretty good glimpse of Roger Maris. This runs the gamut from ""too real"" to ""not real at all"". I am at a loss of words to describe this film. It is easy to relate to the main character, but it reminds us of our dark side just beneath the surface (the one that we all try to hide or ignore). The ending is not quite expected, but not staggering considering the situation. Definitely an under-rated film. Okay, I am not into romances, but my wife is. I put off seeing this because of the dopeyness that I expected. It was better than that, though. Enough science, intrigue and romance to be a good mix. Definitely a good date mix, but even good for a wider audience. This is a great DVD for Libertarians (including myself). Although there is a little too much Bush-bashing (some is warranted), most of the items are dead-on and help the viewer to consider things from a new perspective. It does not come off as a I-got-the-answers presentation, but more as what-are-we-all-afraid-of which triggers independent thinking. Worthwhile viewing for thinking audiences. This is a watchable movie, especially for couples or dates, but it is not great. Kate Hudson does do a really good job of being a really ""bad"" date -- she made me squirm because I would have dumped her on the first ""bad"" date. Overall, the actors do a good job and make the film enjoyable and humorous, with a touch of emotion, so it has appeal for wider audiences. For this genre, it is a typical romance-comedy. The actors are very good, but the story is a bit tiresome -- so much like all its competition. A good ""date"" movie with microwave popcorn, but not outstanding. This was an entertaining four hour series about the weather. It covers wind, wet (water), cold, and heat. Kinda like the Crocodile Hunter meets the weather. It is pretty good and doesn't have the ""typical"" BBC flavor that I expected. Especially good at grabbing the attention of kids as they learn. Fun for adults, too. Not nearly as bad as the sequel, but not nearly as good as the original. Yes, it ties together some loose ends, but it really just borrows from other movies. The effects are merely repeats of the original. All in all, nothing really spectacular here. Only watch it if you must see all three episodes. As seeing so many disastrous disaster films, with only a few exceptions, I had put off seeing this for a long time. But, this film is pretty good. Yes, some of it is predictable, but there are also some novel ideas presented. Much of it is believable. The action is not edge-of-your-seat, but it is nail-biting at times. This is a five-star movie, but not a ""strong"" one. The message is good an thought provoking. It is delivered in a professional style. The comedy is good (a couple times we fell off our seats). Certainly qualifies for a good date flick. Be forewarned -- it may change your life. Not by some overnight cure, but just the little thoughts that it triggers and grow on you. This is a good family movie that we watched this evening. Good story, good acting, good filming, with lots of little funny parts. Definitely recommended for a family film and pizza night. This is a good combination of many other movies. Only a few things are really original, but you don't mind when watching it. Ben Affleck does a better job than I expected him to, although he occasionally lapses into the slower-than-life thought patterns. Good movie. Having seen this as it occurred, I thought that the film might be a flop when it hit the theaters. When it came out on video, I watched it. Definitely better than I expected. Somewhat about what is to be expected, but it is an uplifting film and one that really fills in a niche in this time period. This is a very good movie with realistic turns of events that make the viewers believe it could happen to them. Good acting and good delivery. Put it on your list. This is a good family movie. Not great, but good and watchable. We saw it at our school as a school movie and I think the kids really liked it (first and second graders the most). Kinda like a kiddie rebellion stage without being obnoxious. This is kinda silly, but watchable. Especially if you have a religious background and are willing to laugh at the silly extremes people will go to. Fairly predictable, but some feel-good parts keep it afloat. This was slow and predictable, but good. If you are ready to just relax and watch, this is a good flick. There are enough changes, in time and topic, to keep you interested. The actors do a very good job and most of us can relate to different aspects of each person. Overall, watchable. When I saw previews for this movie, I thought it was going to be a lot like ""Backdraft"". If only. This movie pales by comparison. Too plodding, too shallow (although a lot of time is spent trying to do character development), and too safe. It's like they had nothing else to do, so why not make this movie. Not nearly as scary as I thought it would be. However, it has some similarities to ""Blair Witch Project"". Especially in that it could happen in real life (truth is absolutely scarier than fiction, we often just don't want to think about it). The older style of English almost got on my nerves, but not so much. Overall, decent movie. This is a good romance movie, but not a great one. Granted, this is not my favorite genre, so that probably makes me more picky. This movie follows a predictable pattern, but the setting is different enough to be interesting. The actors are decent and fairly realistic. Good date movie. This is a superb representation and great acting by Bacon. I have seen most of his movies and his been impressed by his range (I still fail to see how many less talented actors with less range get nominated, ah, well). The emotional ranges are impressive and realistic. Some of the other reviewers have done such an excellent job, I will stop here and defer to them. This is very good, but it is NOT an action movie. It really is like a minimalist Broadway show turned movie. It is somewhat of a middle-age coming-of-age-midlife-crisis for single/divorced people, but entertaining. The kind of thing that is just messed up enough that it has to be true. When I hear the title, I keep thinking of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (aka ""Live. Die. Repeat.""), but that was a better movie. This one is so-so, but good enough for a movie-night viewing. Much of it is predictable, but in a good way. But, it could have been done in a shorter timeframe, or maybe more twists could have been thrown in. This is too much like ""The Matrix"". For the first half hour, it was making me mad. All the same effects and even in same locations. Although some of the good/evil approaches were actually thought provoking, it wasn't really new. Not bad for a filler, but not a main event. This is certainly an old genre, but the movie turns out good. Although somewhat predictable, it has a much more realistic angle that most films of this type forget. We have a talented professional who forgets it all, which would be a blessing to many in the field, but who shows that what most of us really want (besides freedom) is to know ourselves and to be loved. This film provides both and does it at a good pace. This was just an OK movie for me. I wanted to watch it, because of the long history of it. I imagine at the time that it made a much larger social impact, but it really doesn't stand out, now. It could probably be condensed into a one-hour TV show (i.e., half its current run time) or less. Still, a decent enough classic to watch. If you are a serious movie lover, you must see this movie.  The DVD  transfer is very good, and you'll see facial expression details that could  not be seen on VHS (even with the best equipment).  END This has a touch of ""The Matrix"" and ""Inception"". Just touches, not on the same level by any means. It almost seems more like a made-for-TV movie. But, it's not bad. Be careful, you might have dreams about it. And it might impact the next time you sleep in a hotel room. ""Blue Star"". The words will ring like ""Rose Bud"". Something that propels a person to heights of success then plummets to career failure.... This is a ""real life"" presentation that is worth multiple viewings. I loved ""Grosse Point Blank"" and ""High Fidelity"" with Cusack and ""My Cousin Vinny"" with Tomei. Didn't love this movie, though. Although the production quality was really good and the acting was decent, it just didn't work for me. It seemed like it was mixing too many genres and not doing any of them justice. ""Blue Star"".

I'm liking the new Jim Carrey. More mature but still spontaneous and a little wacky. Lots of funny parts and generally a good family movie (just a couple parts that are questionable but the young ones probably won't notice and the teenagers probably will like oh-come-on-mom-and-dad). A general feel-good movie. I'm liking the new Jim Carrey. More mature but still spontaneous and a little wacky.

Although some of the good/evil approaches were actually thought provoking, it wasn't really new. Not bad for a filler, but not a main event. I originally heard of this because of the geocaching. Yes, there are a couple things that aren't quite accurate, but it's very close and certainly gets at the heart of geocaching.  This romantic comedy is worth watching as just that. The acting is very good and draws us into their world. It's nice to have a feel-good movie that's not too mushy. I watched this after reading ""Rebel Without a Crew"", about how Robert Rodriguez made this movie on a $7,000 budget. The book was very good. With the rave reviews in the book, I expected a lot from the movie.  The first couple minutes of the movie were shaky, but the rest of the 30-minute action part was very good. The story kept me interested in the rest of the movie and it turned out to be pretty good. This wasn't great, but it's much better than a lot of the current films. It'll keep your attention, especially if you've liked McConaughey in other films. The best part is trying to guess just how he'll pull it off. In that regard, it's more realistic than many other movies which have resolutions that just don't happen much, if at all. This is a good family movie, for teens or older. The kids do a really good job of acting and I think that makes it especially appealing -- for both kids and adults. But it's somewhat light on plot and a bit predictable, but it still keeps your attention. I'd heard mixed reviews about this, and that's about where I'd leave it. There's lots of good history to be seen here that you might not have seen elsewhere, so if you're a chess fan, it's worth seeing. It's sidesteps some of the typical controversy, which is good because that's been beaten to death. This is definitely a date flick. It is somewhat like ""Groundhog Day"", but with a romantic twist. Not as funny, but enjoyable. Seeing Adam Sandler in this role was like seeing Bill Murray in his more serious films -- both pull it off better than expected. The ending was nice and upbeat. Good film. Fortunately, this wasn't too predictable. Hopefully you haven't had spoilers before watching it.  Cruise does a decent job acting, reminiscent of some of his better acting bits, but not his best. This was enjoyable. Some of it was predictable, but some twists kept it interesting. It's good for a laid back evening of viewing. The acting is good, but not outstanding, it just seems to work. The animation at the beginning is bad. Really bad. It's like it went back 20 years and even then used only mediocre technology. OK, let's ignore that part.  The story line is pretty good. The acting is good. There were only a few points that I though ""oh, come on"" when something too simplistic or outrageous was employed.  Yes, in some ways it was predictable, but it's a generally good action film. I'm not into zombie movies or shows, excluding ""Night of the Living Dead"", but I liked this. It was recommended to me and I wasn't sure about it. I mean, it IS a zombie movie. Granted, a different variety. But, these held my attention. Kinda like a sci-fi, medical, horror flick. This was better than I expected, but still not great. Unfortunately, it's what I fear will be happening in 50 years, not 150 years (OK, except for the unrealistic open-canopy of Elysium). Some of it's simple, but there's decent action, decent acting, and the good guy wins. It still begs the question for what happens after that, but good entertainment for an evening or weekend afternoon. Saw several time in theaters and several more times on Blu-Ray. This is an easy shot for being recommended. It's amazing that it's based on a true story, but just another data point in the truth-is-greater-than-fiction truism. Granted, there are some departures from the true story, but the spirit of the story seems to be intact. The acting is very good, the action is compelling, and the scenery is enticing. I look forward to seeing it yet again. I thought Hanks and crew did a really good job. I felt as if I were in the situation itself. It didn't seem like much of stretch from reality, like lots of competing based-on-a-true-story movies are. I'd say this rates pretty well as a Friday night movie or even a family movie, for more mature children. I found that I couldn't look away for most of the movie. The acting is great by Eddie Redmayne, well-deserving the Academy Award. Trying not to spoil, but some of it is real life. I'm not an authority on how accurate it is, but it just seems real, good and bad. Going out of the theater, a comment we had, and we heard others say the same, was that ""Denzel didn't disappoint"". It's another commanding performance of his. Some of his films have strayed into mediocrity, but this gets it back on course. No, not his greatest performance, but a good one. Maybe on par with ""Training Day"", but from a positive viewpoint, where the ""good"" guy wins. This wasn't as good as the hype led me to believe, but it was good. Decent acting and effects. Much of the plot was predictable, but that also has its positive side. It made for enjoyable viewing. This wasn't as good as the hype led me to believe, but it was good. Decent acting and effects.

Much of the plot was predictable, but that also has its positive side. It made for enjoyable viewing. I give it 5 stars, with a qualification - it isn't for everyone. It's not in the flavor of many recent documentaries that try to be a Hollywood movie. This is more the plain, simple interview format. But, there's so much information here, it's deserving of 5 stars. The history displayed here is incredible. This movie was surprisingly good. With the title, and the long list of mediocre comic spinoffs, I wasn't expecting much from this movie. It has action, good acting, a feel-good theme, and is polished. Very good for a Friday night movie. This is too much like ""The Matrix"". For the first half hour, it was making me mad. All the same effects and even in same locations.

A12IQ99MWM9YQ8," RC has more humor than TG (plus).TG had better production values than RC (plus).TG had more memorable villains than RC (plus).The murdered father angle worked a little better for Kim Darby in TG than Kate Hepburn in RC (Hepburn and Lormer, as her dad, look around the same age) (plus) BTW to the poster who claimed TG was Bob Duvall's first movie---wrong. He was previously in To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962. Despite Peter Sellers in three roles this is all pretty laugh-free as a comedy. Great sets, good dialogue (interesting but not humourous at all). I never heard that Pickens thought he was in a drama all the time he was filming. Doubtul when he's filming the sequeance when he's on the bomb falling out of the plane he still thought he was in a drama. From going into the toilet as it is almost a total rehash reemake of the original Airplane. He is a welcome breath of fresh air as a guy who knew Striker in the war and Shat now works at (inspiringly) a base in outer space. Best lines in the film are Shat's by far! Ssh! Ssh! I've seen it many times. I used to get the jokes occasionally mixed up with it's somewhat inferior sequel, Airplane 2, but I have learned which joks are from which. The film has a modern but still timeless feeling to it and the comic deadpan delivery by otherwise very dramatic actors is excellent. A winner. Did this film merit one? Not really! Jaws got no audio commentary. Why should this flick? Few saw Timerider (at least in the USA) in it's theatrical release. Perhaps it became a hit on cable in late 1983. The dialogue is often silly (""She don't shoot no Dorset! Nobody shoots no dorset"") but at least there are no bleeding heart characters in the film and it's mostly a lot of fun. Airport was first by about two years and really started the genre. The cast in this movie is all three dimensional and believable to a large degree. My former science teacher told us this type of giant wave on the sea coming out of nowhere could never happen in real life. If true this film is science fiction. The acting, scenery, and gritty realism of TFC make it brilliant. But sadly the DVD (despite two discs) sports no bloopers or outtakes of the movie. Also, why couldn't Hackman and Scheider have a complete and seperate commentary each, instead of the half commentary each their given? I thought she was sexy and brilliant as Eve Taschmacher, criminal Lex Luthor's girlfriend. She really stole every scene she was in. One of my prepubescent fantasies was she in Superman back in '79 when I frst saw it. It's when Charley Kane (Wells) is singing with some girls at an office party about his name being Charlie Kane. THe rest of the film is excellent drama, told mostly in flashback. A film with a real point about desire, longing, journalism, romance, and the greart American success story. Mike Savary, I too used to watch Creature Double Feature on WLVI Channel 56 Boston, MA (from Lawence, MA) back in the 1970's every saturday afternoon. I saw this film then and I now have the DVD. The scenes are rather lengthy but to me that gives it more story. Acting is good, cinematography is really clear enough for viewing though it could be clearer. Long but satisfying audio commentary explaining much of the production. Is this adequate remake of the 1960 Hayley Mills classic. I wish the pacing of this film had been slower as it would have been nearly as the original if it had just been slower paced as the actors (especially Lohan) are first rate in their acting. They can force folks at gunpoint to get there. Then once there so many blab about following your heart and such. The movie is uneven but still very good thanks to faultless performances and beautiful direction. Hard to believe a Sicilian born man directed these wasps. This movie, unlike the first two pictures, actually has soap opera type storyline. Ellen tells her daughter-in-law, Carla, about the former's feelings for Hoagie. We never saw such sappy elements in the previous films in this series. Everyone rightfully picks on the extra-foolish storyline but let's not forget the soap elements sink this turkey more than it's already sunk anyhow. None of them can sing well. None of them can dance well (cept for Chapman--a little). The shows are funny but in a lot of ways childish too. Not quite as great as made out to be. first comes ashore and hallucinates that he sees a bunch of modern vacationers stareing at him. That scene is positively eerie. Then when the illusion evaporates and Crusoe realizes he's alone on a desert island (and really screwed!) it's all classic. Nancy Kwan is sexy in her role. BTW to another poster Floyd is a chimp not a monkey. He was very much a product of the writers. Do not give actor David Ogden Stiers all the credit for creating CEW as much of Winchester that made him popular (like his nifty Boston background) was the invention of writers not Stiers himself. Show still very good (though inferior to it's first three years). BTW Hawk became an only child in season four, not season six. I never much watched ALF back in the 80's and early 90's when it was on primetime. But I have grown fond of it in syndication. To me the show is great because it goes down so easy. I like Anne Schedeen's characters of Mrs. Tanner as she acts upset a lot at the alien's antics which provides some conflict in the scripts. And she looks nice in a towel too. In one early scene Edgar Buchannan's character is having a bachelor party with his also old buck friends. THe bachelor party is them all sitting in rocking chairs going back and forth! Fortunately once Buchannan meets up with his old pal Brennan things get better from there. Natalie Wood's sister Lana has a small but meaty role in this western dramedy too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AJM37F8PBJXUX," Got it for Father's Day , it's loaded with extras, it's a classic and he loves it. No further explanation for this classic movie that is a part of the pop culture collective conscious. Synopsis: Two men on bikes searching for the American Dream, beautifully shot, great soundtrack. If you haven't seen it buy it now. 10/10 Beautifully shot/scored fantasy film. With the opera audio you get two movies for the price of one and Criterion always satisfies with their quality, and the extras.  It's amazing that such a great film was made in Nazi Occupied France where tyrannical control and harsh censorship were rampant.  Even with it's budget this film still has awesome effects and uses darkness to it's advantage. It is a perfect fantasy film. Great movie about the famous Irish Revolutionary leader Michael Collins. It's very memorable and makes a legend into a flesh and bone man. It doesn't paint a glorification of him but makes him human. It neither glorifies or demonizes but brings a fresh air of realism to the larger than life man affectionately known as ""The Big Fella.""   5/5 great movie I've always loved the series so here goes, great trilogy with extras and the original Non-rated Robocop is included so Win Win! Great action, american political/social satire at it's finest (especially good if you remember the 80's) and it remains as groundbreaking and poignant today as it did back then. It's a classic. 10/10 Dr. strangelove is immediately recognized to be one of the most brilliant satirical films of all time.  It's brilliance lies in turning the tension of The Cold War and the threat of Nuclear War into a brilliant black comedy movie. It's full of memorable hilarious lines, quirky characters, and hysterical situations. The humor in this film has something for everyone.  10/10 highly recommended film Luis Valdez (La Bamba) directs this cool latino musical about the infamous Zoot Suit Riots and the unjustly prisoned latinos and their release. Edward James Olmos (Miami Vice, Bladerunner)  plays the narrorator El Pachuco who oozes coolness. I first saw this on El Rey Network and had to buy it! Put on the Suit, play the Myth! Oddball characters, dark humor, two great directors (Jeunet and Caro), this is such a creative film. If you liked The City of Lost Children check this out. A butcher owns a tenant house/butcher shop in a post-apocalyptic setting where meat is a rarity and human is on the menu. Hilarity ensues as the unsuspecting could end up as fine cuts for their neighbors. If you judge it on it's own merit this is a great revenge flick starring two great actors (William Devane and Tommy Lee Jones).  It's a different movie and is good in it's own right.  The finale is worth the price of admission alone. Another great release from Shout Factory, great transfer and sound, packed with extras. Shout Factory always gives the treatment that cult classics need! The movie is of course the first of the Post-Apocalyptic genre. It kickstarted the action genre craze. The ending inspired SAW. It's a really good flick and is seminal. The use of the camera to convey speed, the use of stunts, this film is amazing. A great Silent German-Expressionist film which is chilling and was the first film to feature a twist ending. A must have for those who love German Expressionism films and classic cinema. Jeunet and Caro Team up on this dark fantasy about a mad scientist who steals childrens dreams. Ron Perlman plays a strongman who is out to rescue his little brother from the madman. It has all the good things you'd expect from the directors, oddball characters, surreal atmosphere, and is beautifully shot and filmed. This dvd release is barebones but check out the Amazon exclusive 20th anniversary edition bluray, to be released October 13th 2015. Great historical drama film, beautifully shot, a great score to boot.  Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas are amazing in this film. They do take some liberties in this film as any hollywood take of any source material will do. If you can't get enough of Scorsese of Italian tough guy films then this is the movie for you. It's the movie that established the Italian-American Machismo character in cinema. It's beautifully shot, has a great soundtrack, which most of the budget went to. Scorsese used his own records and had to secure the rights.  It's semi-autobiographical, and It's a classic for a reason. 10/10 Funny yet juvenile take on The Most Dangerous Game. Mr. Leguizamo doesn't care for it these days but it lauched his career into serious acting. If you want a unPC live action Bugs Bunny movie then enjoy the Kino! One of the few thrillers that had me on the edge of my seat. It really is a great film and Michael Douglas is an awesome actor. The film handles tension masterfully and the finale is amazing. This movie tells a fictionalized account of the Battle of Mount Austen. It has some memorable scenes and a five star cast but it suffers from uneven pacing that prevents it from being a memorable experience. The pacing goes from fast to slow as molasses. Making some segments of the movie almost unbearable. It is an uneven experience and doesn't mesh well as a whole. Worth a borrow or rent before making a decision to buy. Awesome film epic that is a masterpiece. The hero of the Epic faces hardships and treks as heroes of ancient epics do. The themes of the movie make it timeless. Brilliant score, cinematography, and acting. A must watch! Great movie where two gunmen find redemption from a kidnapping gone awry. Every bullet is accounted for and all guns are handled professionally. The only neverending magazine scene is used tastefully as an homage to old westerns. This is so underrated. It really is worth checking out. A Bullet for the General is a great example of a Zapata western, a western set in Mexico during the revolution. It is pretty much the opposite of Duck You Sucker. It is an enjoyable western and has some comedic moments, great action and an ending that took me by surprise. I'd recommend it to fans of the western genre. I love the interpretation of the aliens being demons and (holy) water killing them. But my goodness this was awkwardly paced with extremely awkward characters. It was just off as a whole presentation. The aliens are pretty unnerving. I really can't hate on M Night for bringing his ideas and creativity to the screen but this felt like a mess. Dr. Mabuse is a quintessential villain and Fritz Lang once again makes a classic film that is beautifully shot/scored. A must have for fans of Fritz Lang's films and classic cinema. This was a pretty good adaption of the tie-in book to Stephen King's Rose Red. It's always interesting to see a movie adaption of a book. It sticks pretty well to it's source material, it doesn't go as in depth as the book. All that said, for those who want to have the film version companion I highly recommend it. Set during the Invasion of Normandy, Saving Private Ryan is a memorable movie from start to finish. It is one of the most graphic and realistic portrayals of WWII (and war in general) in cinema.  It deserves every accolade it has received. It is extremely gripping from beginning to end. 5/5  A great movie, a must see. So hilarious, what redblooded american doesn't enjoy laughing at the ridiculous "" 'Murrica Culture""? Trey Parker and Matt Stone can make fun of anyone or anything. They take on the World Policing of American Special Ops/Military and Hollywood Limousine Liberals and their misguided causes with puppets! Based on the novel of the same name, this is a great film. It's beautifully shot, scored, and a compelling story. It leaves you rooting for hope of the lovers to be reunited. I especially love the balance of a great love story, with great WWI Sequences. There's romance, heartbreak, comedy, suspense, twists and turns. This is more than just a movie, its an experience, an emotional roller coaster. I'd highly recommend it. Great crime dramas. Beautifully shot, I love spotting the 90's Alternative bands posters in this trilogy (The Nixons Foma Album poster for one) Pusher III is the most hard hitting and i felt extremely sorry for Milo. The sequel is the weakest in my opinion but it is still a good movie.  For those who like the director or love crime dramas and gritty movies then this is your trilogy. The extras are great too. Synopsis/Mild Spoiler: A Chinese man from a well to do family marries a Japanese girl.  They both have differences in culture and both believe theirs to be superior. The fighting choreography is great and it's a good fun, Kung Fu film. This movie is a great example of French Extremity.  It's raw, hard hitting and full of ""oh jeez"" moments!  The toying with vulnerability is a staple in horror films and having a pregnant victim is a bold move but takes it one step further.  From start to finish it's done masterfully with a take no prisoner's viciousness and an unforgettable chilling ending. It was a decent slasher, the environment and feel was good but the tension didn't satisfy for me (that's just me) The premise was definitely interesting SPOILER ALERT: think Texas chainsaw massacre meets creepy Nazi's set in France.  I found Martyrs, Inside, and High Tension better but it's worth a watch. Synopsis/Mild Spoiler: A Chinese man from a well to do family marries a Japanese girl.

When I rewatched it upon buying, the scenes that I forgot about definitely had me taken back! It was still a poignant film and the ending just as chilling.  Don't look up the premise or spoilers trust me you'll appreciate it better!  This is French Extremity at it's best! An intelligent horror film that is a clever reinvention of the zombie genre.  It really impressed me and left me optimistic to the seemingly stale genres of both the horror and zombie genre! Combining a clever premise with both psychological and visual horror, this movie satisfied me as a jaded horror fan. 10/10 great film, highly recommended! Robert Mitchum plays a creepy preacher with iconic tattoos in the classic seminal film based upon the novel of the same name. It's a must see film and one of those perfect films and Criterion Collection always has great releases with extras. A definitive man's film and amazing art-house film.  One eye is one bad....erm, motor scooter.  This film is beautifully shot and scored and has a great message of meeting one's destiny with dignity and accepting the inevitable. Witness Sergio Leone's final contribution to spaghetti westerns in this brilliant satire. It's more funny than Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid. It's also a good western from a master of westerns. A tragic look at a man trying to find the american dream with the help of suburban swimming pools. We learn more about the Swimmer from his interactions with the other characters along the way until the chilling climax of the film. Existential Crisis in suburban paradise. Great sound and picture quality, best bang for your buck if you want to catch up on the series or want them all in one swoop. The extras are good too. Predator is a classic, the sequel had it's moments but was kindof lackluster, and Predators is a great nod to the original while putting a fresh new formula to the Predator Universe. For the price you can't pass it up! Great horror movie that keeps the spirit of fun 80's horror and Christmas alive! From the minds of Trick 't Treat. Love that the family elder from the old country is portrayed in a positive light, love the practical effects. It's great when a movie is made with love and it shows! Great release, tons of extras. Too bad the b&w version and score only version isn't here, but I'm pleased with it. The movie takes everything you loved about Road Warrior and cranks it to eleven. Great release, tons of extras. Too bad the b&w version and score only version isn't here, but I'm pleased with it. The movie takes everything you loved about Road Warrior and cranks it to eleven. The Monkey style kung fu in this film is amazing. The grace meets silliness of it makes me think of Fist of The Drunken Master. Like many kungfu films, a master trains a young pupil in a style of Kung Fu, the pupil then masters it after the tough training regimes and fights the corrupt in the village. I'd highly recommend it to serious kungfu flick fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A1EDXH59J6H5W7," I never tire of this movie seen several times . All star cast GREAT CHEMISTRY characters played well to gather sad,funny , quick wit . All in all makings of a great movie. This movie worth the watch and add to your collections of movies . Read the reviews almost didn't watch it but was GLADE I did. Suspenseful,creepy, supernatural, ghost children, urban legend of horrific tragedy.like watching scary movies supernatural, true stories or urban legend. Since I'm on prime through Amazon I didn't have to pay for it. But would of .That's how much I liked it !  Good acting, casting,plot, directing. Just didn't scare me . No reach out grab u kind of movie. Poor acting, no chemistry really going on etc. Low budget u can differently tell . Sister/author was not believable. None of the actors was believable. Boring !!!

No reach out grab u kind of movie. Poor acting, no chemistry really going on etc. Low budget u can differently tell . Sister/author was not believable. None of the actors was believable. Boring !!! For a older movie was not to bad but was not the best. Special effects are not the same as today. Acting so so.  Wasn't feeling the movie to much . Didn't make me jump or want to hide my face. Kinda comical at time. Guess if u want a little comedy with your horror classic then this would be for you. Hadn't seen this film for a very long time. Still has chills and the scares . Creepy, scary good ! Wes Craven can bring it to the screen. Good watch if u like Wes Craven' s films. Glade I seen this movie again ! Caught couple of things I missed on first time. Love the Org or giant in the movie . Kick ass brother and sister witch hunters. Great movie story line, sad, but had few funny parts,etc. Enjoyed watching again. Must see movie. Felt generous gave two stars. Only couple parts found interesting. Beginning started good thought man glade I'm going to watch this. Really unbelievable. A little creepy . No chemistry really between these actors . Seen better possession shows. Just really didn't grab me. Creepy not scary until the end . At least u know where Katie and Hunter is now tormenting/haunting another family . Watched all the PA films they were creepier and scarier I think.  Not a bad movie could of been a little better. But will give 4 stars for the actors and the boys performance and special effects. Question the remake of this version of Carrie but over all not a bad movie. Some scenes was played a little different . Acting was good on most part GOOD chemistry with the cast. But nothing beats the original horror movie Carrie . Still worth the watch ! Very well acting. Keeps you interested. More like spooky horror movie. Almost kinda like twilight zone with the way they ( both families ) couldn't leave . They was picked for reasons I won't say that brought them there. Few twist and turns in the movie kept me interested . Not a sleeper movie it's a well acted and a excellent plot movie. Must watch !!!!  Don't think you would be disappointed. Been a while since I've seen this kind of mystery, drama, horror hack them up kind of movie .  The girl is one BAD ASS BITCH !! Father taught her real good .  Family, money ahhh greed !! Had few moments of scare ! Kinda creepy weird and spooky at times. First wasn't for sure to watch after reading some of reviews glad I watched.  Could of been a little better as for camera a little jumpy . But worth the watch. Not the best horror movie but it had few good parts to it I thought. Ending had a surprising twist to it.  Kinda a creepy twist . Now you could say she was CRAZY IN LOVE with him. His wife Maggie obviously had psychological issues there. Worth the watch . Then u can decide for yourself. Besides if your on Amazon prime it's free. Descent horror/thriller flick. For low budget had good pace, scares, thrills, little gore, plot and ending excellent I thought . Good verses evil. I would say a must watch and u decide. Only u can decide about this documentary . I came out with truth, disturbing,fascinating, even entertaining documentary . Follow the yellow brick road . How many out there still is !? Learned a little bit more then I already knew . What has happened to our country ? We are in turmoil and falling quick !  WAKE UP ! JUST WAKE UP AMERICA !!! Huston we have a serious problem !!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1SYKKZAZVPDYD," A glimpse into the good old days in New York.  Good acting, good story, and good morals.  No one jumped into bed with anyone. Both the good and bad side of people was shown.  The good side prevailed. Great portraits of different character types, from the incompetent to the great, the warrior to the politician, the coward to the hero.  The language was not what we hear today but very much ""real world"" and believable.  We think the Media is bad today, it seems that they were active molding what we think back then as well.  War is Hell, people do die, beautiful buildings are destroyed was it worth it then and is it worth it now? Never thought I would watch it to the end but it kept your interest the whole way the acting was so good that you almost didn't need the words to be in english.  We turned down the volume just high enough to hear the music. Well done especially because it was somewhat true.  The end with the interviews was special.  My wife said she felt odd rooting for the bad guys.  It is great to see a movie one can enjoy without the sex and malicious violence of todays movies. This had explosions, and shooting but most in the air.  Well done from beginning to end. Way too many '""f"" words not needed; did not enhance the plot.  Disappointed, I expected better from the actors that were in it. One way I judge if a movie will be good is to see who is in the movie some actors won't do bad movies. This film was borderline.  It was too ""real life"" I like to be entertained. WHAT A LET DOWN AFTER THE BEGINNING.  TOO VIOLENT. THE BEGINNING WAS FUNNY LAUGHED THROUGH THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES I WAS HOPING FOR MORE BUT THE PLOT WENT TO THE DARK SIDE. Great portraits of different character types, from the incompetent to the great, the warrior to the politician, the coward to the hero.  The language was not what we hear today but very much ""real world"" and believable.  We think the Media is bad today, it seems that they were active molding what we think back then as well.  War is Hell, people do die, beautiful buildings are destroyed was it worth it then and is it worth it now? Great historical content, wonderful drama, and great acting all in one.  Believable characters, showed both the noble and the dispicable side of man.  The movie had a great plot with many subplots occurring at the same time.  There is violence, sex, comedy, and ""chick flick"" depicted in the movie but all in just the right amounts nothing vulgar or crude.  Unfortunately as a society we haven't advanced much from that time in our country's history. It proves you don't need blatant sex and violence to have an enjoyable movie.  No foul words only good acting make it pleasant to watch.  The mystery peels like an onion each episode reveals a clue or two and develops the characters even more. Great ending.  Shows that corruption has existed in society for eons.  It also showed that there are decent civil servants that do the right thing.  The twists and turns made the movie enjoyable not predictable. Have never seen such great performances!  Action packed from beginning to end.  Choreography was added to circus acts to make it even more awesome.  There is even a story line thrown in to give you some mystery. The number of acts was almost overwhelming. Not what I expected but was interesting. Done very well, kept our interest throughout.  Having real footage and interviews with the actual people involved added even more interest to the facts. The premiss of deception has been improved upon today but it was great to see the roots. A great theme Prayer works. Very good acting. Enjoyable from beginning to end. You don't realize it at first but the cast is mostly black for much of the movie.  That was refreshing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A3F9UAX22LLZWK," Good storyline, but it's very fluffy. Sally Field does much better acting than Julia Roberts, proving that experience counts. Tom Skerrit's character is a very stupid husband/father and not realistic at all. It was fun to watch. This is a fun movie. I watched it on my I-Pad and didn't get very good streaming. I thought that the acting was good and there were some very funny scenes. Very rich movie from the acting to the singing to the songs being sung. I was not disappointed in this movie at all and you probably won't be either should you buy it. I've always loved this movie. Handsome man, beautiful woman, and Danny Divito. Funny movie. Lots of scenery from Mexico. Good acting. Some bad language and a ""soft"" bedroom scene make it unsuitable as a family movie. This is a very entertaining movie. I didn't care for Harry Connick, Jr.'s character, but that's just a small role. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum both do good jobs with their characters. I bought these episodes to complete my Star Wars collection. They definitely are not as good as 4 through 6.  The DVDs are good quality.  For being the beginning of the Star Wars story, there are more robots than people interacting with each other and I would think it would be the other way around. Judi Dench's acting is superb. The spreading venom just oozes from her character. The family scenes of Cate Blanchett, her husband and children are not too believable. This is an adult movie, which moves slowly at the beginning. I really like the way Robert Downey, Jr. played the great Mr. Holmes. The scenes, of course, are nothing like the written books of Sherlock Holmes, but it's very enjoyable watching this movie. This is an enjoyable movie, but I think Burgess Meredith likes playing the ""dirty old man"" a little too much--sometimes actors are allowed to go off-script and improvise and I think it's one of those times. Other than that, I think the actors did a great job. This is a very morose and confusing adaptation. Perhaps there was too much editing for time restrictions. If you haven't read the book, you'll find some scenes hard to follow because of some needed explanation left out. I love this series. A British friend of mine told me Selfridge's still exists on Oxford. I didn't give it five stars because some of the acting is not to the quality of Downton Abbeys', which I watched first. That series started me on watching other PBS series.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A29736SKZFX9Z7," This movie is great for all ages and the lessons that it gives is great. I love how Charlie becomes a ""good dog"" and Itchy is a great friend. Very good kids movie. this is a movie I grew up watching around the holidays, I had to get it to have my 13 year old son watch it. He liked it and wants a gremlin now. Way better and picked up the story line, its way more action packed then the first two seasons. I really like Carmella she seems to be the one who gets me. I wasn't to keen on the way it ended but from what I heard I'll be more upset at the end of the entire series. I love Paulie he is my favorite, Christopher is a junkie I can't deal with that. Yo the Vito plot line was hilarious I was definitely surprised about that one. Just like everyone else I hated the end but I loved the story line no matter what. Carmela was always my favorite right along with Paulie he should of had a bigger role I feel like. I was sad to see the way Bobby was taken out but not surprised I definitely wished Junior would of been killed off before the end though. Very super funny movie, great story line and the acting is so funny. This is one of the go to movies when you need something to watch to pass the time. Great movie Very super funny movie, great story line and the acting is so funny. This is one of the go to movies when you need something to watch to pass the time. Great movie I am a big fan of Edie Falco I will support her career always. This is a little different she has a attitude and tells it like it is. Very addictive show. Out of all the season's this one was the slowest going for me I found myself not even paying attention but then at the end it just picks up and your like why did it take so long. I am a big fan of Nurse Jackie I loved the entire series and the characters. Zoey and Thor were great I was sad to see Coop got and the London chick who I can't remember her name. All around a good series if you like hospital shows and Edie Falco. I was so sad to learn this was the last season kicking it with Nancy. I all around liked this series and will continue to watch it during the winter months. I am a big fan of Nurse Jackie I loved the entire series and the characters. Zoey and Thor were great I was sad to see Coop got and the London chick who I can't remember her name. All around a good series if you like hospital shows and Edie Falco. Now this was a great movie, I loved the story line. It kept me guessing from the very beginning. My 15 year old son even watched the entire movie with me. I wasn't to happy with the ending but the story line and acting was great. This was so different I definitely liked it. I was surprised a few times in this movie. I will watch anything Robin Williams or Mila Kunis. Different movie, kind of weird I liked it. I watched this just because Jennifer Aniston was in it. It was a decent movie, it had some funny parts but there wasn't any part that jumped out at me like I love this movie. All around just decent I am a big fan of Nurse Jackie I loved the entire series and the characters. Zoey and Thor were great I was sad to see Coop got and the London chick who I can't remember her name. All around a good series if you like hospital shows and Edie Falco. Absolutely love this series, once the rest come out I will be buying every single one. I love the characters and  the story line. This is a series that could go on forever since the jail population always is changing. I was somewhat disappointed with the end but yet it made so much sense that I ended up loving it. Did she live, Did she die, who knows. I enjoyed this series from beginning to end. I am a Edie  Falco fan. I never even heard of this just came across it while browsing movies. My son and I love football movies so we rented this and enjoyed it. I liked the story line and the characters. Very well done. I am hooked I love all the characters and the drama everyone goes through. This is a very interesting series and I will be watching. I can't wait until Season 4 is dropped on DVD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ATOM3R33LV089," Ridiculously stupid propaganda crap film.  Anyone who lived during this time is clearly insulted by John Wayne's gung ho kill the commies in Nam BS.  A total joke- so much so, the movie has a campy feel.  Absolute stupidity with an idiotic ""America can do no wrong"" nonsense plot.  Watch for a sick laugh about see how stupid American foreign policy was in the '60's. Watch the earlier film, ""The Sword Of Gideon""- a far superior movie from all aspects.  That's a 5 star movie; this movie -just because it's Spielberg's doesn't make it cinematic magic; it's just meh. The Sword of Gideon is ~~ excellent.  That's a definite watch. Wonderful, touching and terrific movie.  It's for all and it is a great family movie.  Nothing the kids can't see and it's about Moms and their kids...and sacrifice and the kindness of strangers.  I give it 10 stars.  Don't miss it. Doris Day suffering from a case of the terminal cutes- to the point where you either gag or ask for shot of insulin to deal with her over the top awful sweetness.  Stinks. She's also a little old to play Rod Taylor's wife....she looks more like his mother.  Stinks. Absolutely - awful - exercise in self gratification.  Stupid, vapid, talky and boring.  Oh! now I get why so many seflie taker types are alone and unattached....because they're self absorbed jerks, just like the film's protagonist.  Stinks...don't bother. Meryl..Meryl...Meryl...how desperate are you for roles?  Such a good actress, such an awful movie.  Reminds me of the awful/rotten films Diane Keaton now stars in.  Bleecch.  Alec Baldwin and Meryl Streep are so cute and fat and middle aged and are divorced, ""but really never got over each other-even though it's been 10 years.""  Oh that's a believable story.  Idiotic...both characters should get therapy to deal with their idiotic baggage and Baldwin and Streep should select better roles. Major depressing movie.  Talk about emotional basket cases- a pair- brother and sister.  Never given any background what makes these 2 people so emotionally twisted, but one can only imagine. Characters totally unlikeable.  Downer ending.  Would I recommend?  uh uh.  Forget it. Weird ~ unfunny ~ ""comedy"" about nutcase family - who are an idiotic totally unlikeable ""modern"" parents- and what happens when the wife's mother and father visit.  Unfunny- obnoxious- painful torture.  What in the hell possessed Marisa Tomei -Billy Crystal - Bette Midler  to ~ ever ~ consider working on the megaton bomb? Probably one THE worst movies I have ever seen.  Bleeechhh. Excellent movie that depicts the career of Jackie Robinson who fought racial barriers and bigotry to play in the major leagues.  Inspiring to watch as Jackie must deal with the complete stupidity of the rednecks who dominated baseball.  His team members grow to respect, admire and to defend him.  Wonderful.  A good story for the whole family to watch.  A+ a definite recommend. A nice story about a young German girl in WWII and the kindness of the people she meets.  For the entire family- no cursing or off color scenes ~ a very nice inspirational tale that all the family can watch and enjoy.  A+ a definite watch. Gut wrenching sadness-a tale of cruelty at its finest.  The southern plantations are shown as completely depraved institutions. When I hear certain politicians comments about ""how well treated the slaves were"", I want to vomit.  This is a must watch to see the real history of slavery and it's complete brutality.  A real blight on the ""democracy"" of America. At times funny and at others a poignant tale of parenthood and devotion.  A very nice watch and for once- no over the top cursing and sex- a nice didactic tale that was well worth the watch.  Recommend. Long, boring, depressing story of depressing people.  Trying to be comedic but just comes off depressing and pathetic.  Makes the Midwest look like fools.  The characters are a bunch of losers which makes it even more difficult to watch.  Not my favorite. Such a dumb-self serving move about ""college"" BS revolutionaries of the '60's,  Bored entitled dopey college kids -taking over the dean's office- such hair brained '60's stupidity.  Out dated...this a different world now and these people all look like the nitwits they are.  Based on a lame book -""Confessions of a College Revolutionary"" - like who even cares.  LOL- don't wast your $$ or your time. Dated- dumb-and not funny.  Different world- different times and the idiots in this movie are just plain stupid and boring in a half wit meandering plot.  So so outdated.  Like ""Laugh In""...which really is not funny now, just really (groan) stupid.  Yawn.....",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ASF2Z8OJR0TP3," This movie is a typical 80s teenger movie. Kids having sex. Bad things go wrong. Mom and dad are either clueless or out of sight. Anyway, it shows some 80s design if you want to talk that walk back. But the plot is pretty solid. And the one little guy who turns into a vampire . . . is the best!! I must say I didn't care for this movie . . . at all. There are some attractive men in it for the era. Usually they are so plain. But the two leading men are beautiful. But the story was just not in good taste. I was actually shocked that such a movie would have come out of that era. It was so blatantly ""housewives of atlanta"". Even the ending didn't save it for me. The very beginning of this movie was interesting. The kid actor was good. But when the storybook started . . . sorry I just couldn't get into the over reaching attempt to make another movie with ""cute"" aliens and monsters that talk. These creatures weren't cute and had stupid lines. I turned it off that point. Even as a kid I would have lost interest. Mission Impossible team tries to thwart bad guys around the world. Lots of spy stuff. Tricks. Deception. Action/adventure.  You get to see a young good looking Tom Cruise. He has that all-American look in this film. Lost of great talent in this movie. Twists and turns in the plot to keep you interested/intrigued. You know it is going to be a good movie when a well known actor dies in the first few minutes of the movie.  Good stuff. Some episodes were funny. Of course this is 100% made up silliness. And that is how you have to watch it. Of course they really were not expected to do any work. It was part of the game. I liked the episodes where they were at the airport and plastic surgeon. The wedding planner one was kinda funny too. Funny. The others I can leave. And what is up with that pervert of a dad in DE? Eeeewww. Another liberal movie about how if you don't do drugs, scoff at capitalism, have kids out of wedlock, and get drunk all the time by hanging out in bars you are a loser and ""uncool"". Just more cultural erosion from those stand up Hollywood liberals. Cop is ready to move on but then a crime takes place. He stays to figure it out and finds a new life in Monterrey to keep him there.  This movie was the Tom Hanks before the political charged Hanks. It was back when movies were just sorta entertainment. There is a really really sad scene in this movie though. So if you don't like seeing animals hurt then I suggest you skip this. THe first two were decent. Tame imitations of Indian Jones or National Museum as I wrote on my review of the first one. However this one was very violent. And while it definitely doesn't shy away from the crucifixion of Christ and Judas Iscariot's role/betrayl . . . vampires? Really? The twist to this plot . . . for 5 seconds made this movie interesting. Besides that it was just boring. It was as if I had seen this movie in several other movies. nothing special. nothing horrible. it was just an OK movie to watch when you having nothing else to watch or do. kinda reminds me of the summer movies when I was growing up before the ""blockbuster"" phenom came and went. I have no idea what these other reviewers are talking about when they mention a book as I didn' tknow it was based upon a book. But I hardly think the subject matter could be funny. I've already written a review about The Rockford Files series on here. So this review is solely about this ""Complete Series"" package. I completely appreciate the fact that not only do they put in the regular seasons but they put in the ""movie collections"" too, unlike, oh, Murder She Wrote or Absolutely Fabulous that require you to buy the movie specials separately. Staying true to the Jim Rockford character I think. If you want to know why America is importing cheap low and high skilled immigrants, check out this movie. It explains everything.  The actors were a motley crue that is for sure. What is up with that one guy's eyes? Creepy. And who is that lead actress? How is she a fairy tale part player? Miss Plain Jane, anyone? I marked this as ""OK"". However, while I wanted to like this movie for some reason I just couldn't. I just couldn't get into it. And the ""good guy"" is not a good guy. I think they missed something here. Horrible. Liberal, foul-mouthed, irreverent kids of the late 60s run around sleeping together, doing drugs, cursing their teachers and parents, and being all around jerks. Blacks are so righteous that they tell their grand kids to return the TVs that they looted from the riots. Just more liberal revisionism. Two men meet up with an American woman in Paris. They both seem interested in her but approach romance in different ways. This movie is really nothing more than their competition over her really. Nothing special. Nothing unique. It is not really one of my favorite Colbert movies although two of her films are my favorites. I'll leave it at that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peter Smith What can I say? This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life. Besides, I have seen Robin Williams in better movies. I thought ""Tootsie"" starring Dustin Hoffman was much better. It had a much happier ending. This movie was just flat out sad. Nuff said!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith I bought this DVD to replace a VHS tape that was getting all worn out. Now I have both movies on DVD. I wish they would make a ""Sister Act 3"", that would be really something!!!!!!!!!! Great Family Movies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith I bought this DVD to replace a VHS tape that was getting worn out from many replays over. This is a movie that I have to watch at least once or twice a year. Peter Smith Out of all of the ""Jungle Book"" movies I have seen, I would have to go with the 2016 remake (also from Disney). This version was just too boring for words. SORRY FOLKS. Peter Smith I bought this DVD as a gift for my co-worker's upcoming birthday. She is a huge fan on these kind of movies and I know she will really enjoy this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith I remember renting this movie (On VHS) from Hollywood Video a year or two before it had long gone out of business. Eight months later, I bought the DVD to add to my collection of Disney flicks. But it has been skipping and freezing up alot when last watched, so I may need to buy it again. It is a movie that the whole family can enjoy. It is ""The Little Rascals"" of get fit summer camp!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I own this movie on VHS and will be buying my own copy on DVD soon!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith I have loved reading the book when I was nine years old. I had bought the DVD four or five years ago to replace a Worn out VHS tape. It is definately a keeper My family and I had rented this on VHS 14 or 15 years ago. I had bought my own copy on DVD a year ago so I could see it again. I am very happy to own my own copy and I at least try to watch this movie around Easter every year. And I am about to purchase 2 more to give to the school my mom use to teach at. Peter Smith This was such a boring seaquel. It had nothing on the Cleavland Indians.  it did not have any plot. I would give this no stars if possible. Besides, where is alot of the original cast? Peter Smith I bought this DVD for my Dad. He has worn out his VHS copy so he will be tickled to have it on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can hardly wait to give it to him as a gift!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith Had this and TS2 on VHS for years and finally decided it was time to upgrade to DVD. Great animation, Great musical score by Randy Newman, Great start of animation for Pixar. My favorite 21st birthday gift!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Disney & Pixar Rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith I bought both this movie (although I haven't seen it yet) & ""The Nutty Professor 1"" for my birthday and they had both arrived in great condition!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith I wanted to watch this one again so I ordered it for my birthday. I watched it as a VHS video years back with some ex best friends of my family and I's, and I decided that it was time to get the DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith I just bought the director's cut DVD to replace / upgrade my worn VHS copy. I also own the CD soundtrack too!!!!!!!!! This is one of the greatest trure sports movies ever made. Even Walt Disney himself would have loved it if he were still living today. Peter Smith I read the book twice, rented it on video once, saw it in school once, and saw it twice on TV. If you enjoyed the movies, ""The Great Escape"", and ""Chicken Run"", then this is the movie for you!!!!!!!!! Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith I never actually got to see this movie until I got it as a Christmas gift from one of my social workers. It was a movie that Walt Disney himself would've loved if he were still living today. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go get it. But be sure to have a box of kleanex with you because the ending is kind of sad. Peter Smith I just ordered this for my birthday this year. I already have the VHS version but no longer have a functioning VCR so I thought that the DVD would be helpful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith This is a really gross movie. I felt really sick to my stomach after watching this movie. If you are looking for a decent movie about the human body, Give ""Fantastic Voyage"", or ""Innerspace"" a try. Thanks for reading. Peter Smith I had this on VHS for years but it has not been doing to well recently so I bought the DVD to continue watching it. It is a movie that my family and I can take out and watch once or twice a year to get us in the mood for baseball season. Peter Smith I bought this DVD when I my family and I got our first DVD player. But it got damaged so I had to buy it again. A must have for any movie collector. Peter Smith This is a great action packed movie. My brother bought the VHS version long before Blockbuster was long gone out of business. I am getting it for him on DVD so he can continue to treasure it. Peter Smith I didn't open the DVD as is a gift for my mom's friend's upcoming birthday this year I know she will love it as she is a huge ""Our Gang"" fan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith I saw this on movie on TV when I was sick in the hospital one night and I thought it was was a very well done movie. I got the DVD for Christmas later on that year because it is one of my all time favorite movies. It is a keeper. Peter Smith Big brother wanted this movie so I bought it for him for Christmas the same year t was released to DVD and as far I know, he is really enjoying it !!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith I remember waching this back in elementry school. I went to my local video store to rent it but they did not carry it  so I decided to just buy it. I bought this on VHS and will be upgrading to DVD hopefully real soon. Peter Smith My dad has been wanting this DVD for years but was never available until now and he was so thrilled to finally get it as a gift back in the year of 2011. It was a great Father's Day gift for him. Even the actual theme song is so beautiful that it had me in tears while listening to it. Peter Smith I had bought this DVD for my mom because she really enjoyed the ""Shiloh"" series as much as I did. I thought that ""Shiloh 2"" was just okay bu was not as great as this and the first film but still decent. Shiloh was a really cute dog. These movie are great for the whole family and have a wonderful christian message to them. Peter Smith I got this as a Christmas gift from one of my co-workers back in 2009, and I have seen the original before I got this set but have never seen the sequels!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They are all classics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith I saw this once in the theater and immedialy bought the DVD when it came out. I still think that this sequel was decent even though it was not as great as the second movie ""Meet the Fockers"" which I also own. I don't have the original ""Meet the Parents"" and I don't want it. I'll just stick with the sequels. Peter Smith This was a really cute sequel. I got it as a Christmas gift from one of my friends at my work and as far as know I am really enjoying it. I especially like Amy Adams as Amelia Ayrheart. I hear that is going to be a ""Night at the Museum 3"" coming out I'd wanna say in the year 2016 and I cannot wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith I went to Blockbuster one Friday evening after work to rent ""Secretariat"" but all of their rental copies there were rented out so I rented this. I hated this movie. It was boring as hell. Do NOT rent or buy this movie. You will be disappointed. Peter Smith Got this this a Christmas gift back in 2010. Mainly for the original ""Fantasia"", but I still like ""Fantasia 2000"". I have the original ""Fantasia"" on VHS but always wanted it on DVD. I also have the soundtrack CD, and it gets played so much that it is starting to wear out. Thank you Disney!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith My dad has been wanting this DVD for years but was never available until now and he was so thrilled to finally get it as a gift back in the year of 2011. It was a great Father's Day gift for him. Even the actual theme song is so beautiful that it had me in tears while listening to it. Peter Smith BORING BORING and did I ever mention BORING? I rented this on demand the other night and I thought it was such a sucky movie!!!!!!!!!!!!! What else can I say? It was just plain Horrible!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!! Peter Smith I loved this movie a lot that I am going to buy it for my sister for her upcoming birthday this coming December!!!!!!!!!! I know that she will love it as much as I did!!!!!!!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Megan Fox is better than expected. I love the Venture Bros. Season 4 was excellent! I highly recommend it to all Venture Fans! I don't know why they had to break up the season into two discs and sell them separately though, other than to make more money. The movie was okay. It tells the story that it intended to do. And makes you love your mom even more. Buy it and share it with her and get her to cook for you again! It did my jaded heart good to see that there are still kind people in the world that are being kind just for the sake of being so.

AQXXRRTTUL2AX," My parents explained that hippies and others who opposed wars and greed were beaten, killed and otherwise harmed during the 60's. I look around today and see how environmental and anti-war protesters are treated by the police and the surveillance state, and it's still the same. And the rednecks never go away. They just get bigger guns. Not only is this film historically accurate as to what was done to Native Americans and the American landscape, the brutality shown in the film continues to this day, except that now the brutality is in fracking and other fossil fuels, paving over open spaces, draining the Colorado River, cramming way too many people into the arid American West, factory farms. etc. Costner and his crew made an epic that tells the truth...something you can't say for most movies. Thank the gods for Robert Redford. Not only has he given us so many deep, beautifully-made, heartfelt movies over the years, he's also a progressive activist and philanthropist who's always trying to help the world. This movie is another work of art. If you haven't seen it, also watch All is Lost. I never liked the snark and bleakness of Seinfeld so I thought I wouldn't like this. The show's version of Larry David is such a bumbling, dishonest, selfish, and easy to anger man, and his wife is so patient. I love how it shows almost everybody is venal, argumentative, sleazy. Woody Allen movies are hard to understand for people used to watching shallow movies, and for people who want movies that have zero meaning. As with Blue Jasmine, this movie explores relationships, love, trust, mental illness, sex, and other deep topics. It's not meant to be a ""comedy."" The acting is superb and Spain looks gorgeous. Another intelligent, artistic, original movie dealing with real themes we face in our world. People who didn't like this movie tend to be the type who cannot handle complexity, depth, ethics, or social relevance in film. This same director just released Elysium...another film that deals with issues of truth, ecology, immigration, capitalism, and brutality. The problem here was that the Coen Brothers didn't write this story, they just adapted it. This movie is too standard and old school for the Coens, who usually do totally bizarre and creative things in their films, such as the John Goodman character in Barton Fink, or Javier Bardem's dark persona in No Country. Bridges was almost unintelligible, and Damon was flat. This lacked the cinematic and storytelling uniqueness that the brothers are famous for. For a man who supports veganism, animal rights, and other worthy causes, this guy has degraded himself in so many ways in this film. He has severe substance abuse problems, lacks integrity, is a pathetically-bad rapper, and generates a huge carbon footprint flying around on private planes to do useless things. I lost all respect for him after seeing this, mockumentary or documentary, it's terrible. This movie is important because it shows what the greedy rich are really like, and how capitalism enables materialistic, stupid people to accumulate too much and do too much harm. Most of the CEOs of major corporations (especially war profiteer corporations) are similarly corrupt and sickening. Denzel did a great job, and the initial flight and crash sequence should have been in 3-D. Unfortunately the script is padded with the timeworn ex-wife, addiction, and inner struggle cliches that Hollywood often uses. The movie could have been a lot shorter, and if it had focused on the real problems of air travel a bit more (that the airlines shred maintenance and overfly their pilots while underpaying their crews), it would have been a winner. Redford is a master actor and director, and has long given us amazing movies and is one of the main creators of the independent movie industry. This movie is one of his best. However you will note the negative reviews from people who think that Guardians of the Galaxy is a deep film and cannot understand nuance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2XS8TJDRIWSB0," Easy to believe that's the way a lot of people think-if you don't have a special roster your free-and if you're free you're a monster no one likes. A lot of my friends like the end,but I like the rest. Since Duckie doesn't come out where he's supposed to,and instead Richie Rich does,it isn't Duckie,it's Richie. So instead of the Everything's Duckie Edition,it should be called the Everything's Richie Edition. And about saying thaat the original ending is included...well,let's just say that line isn't going to work on a used car salesman or a lightning rod salesman,but about as much truth. I don't know why,but I've got this thing about Dr. Who stories. This one doesnt work right because all the doctor's personalities are different,but notsodifferent they're almost fighting with each other,like this. This is a side of Doctor Who I never saw...he makes for a good sci-fi story based on 1 problem,but not a mystery based on 6 problems...he just isn't 6 angry men,he's only 1-the Doctor. Or,if you count Romana as an equal instead of his assistant,2. I thought it was going to be something just a child would enjoy,but it's fun for everyone. Good story. Good cast,too. And Penny Marshall did a good jobofdirecting,too-thisis thekind of movie I'd expect from her. A hilarious rendition of the reputation used car dealers have as anything-but-honest. A great cast and enough fresh jokes in a good story to keep me on theedgeofmy seat all the way through. Almost every 007 made a new version of both Die Another Day and The World Is Not Enough...but Brosnan did a better job at both than any of the others,because gizmo-mania isn't all that counts. So do Bond's personality and acting does,too. He's got the right combo if you ask me. You have the best Sherlock Holmes,and the cases are all close to the original written version. Then you have a different actor playing Dr. Watson,but he was written in atjust the right time. This isn't blood and gore sci fi,in fact they are cheesy by comparison. But these aren't just any movies,these movies are the classics-they may be oldies,but they are greats...Hollywood is still putting out take-offs of them. This isn't blood and gore sci fi,in fact they are cheesy by comparison. But these aren't just any movies,these movies are the classics-they may be oldies,but they are greats...Hollywood is still putting out take-offs of them. the only problem isn't the film-it's just that too many people have done that same joke. If I saw it about 5 or 10 years ago I know I woul have liked it a lot more. A lot of people know something about The Wrath Of Khan,but there wasw much more to Star Trek movies than just one movie's title. Besides,if you're a Star Trek fan,this is just right Nothing is even nearly as funny as before they came to Hollywood. A couple of thrill-seeking,boy chasing girls who can't afford anything more than a $5 birthday present and don't have anything more than a high school degree belong in a milltown,not Hollywood. I expected much better from Marshall,but I have to agree with what it said-I had a N.Y. accent,and my dream was to be a mad scientist when I grew up...so I could say ""Aha! I found the secret formula!"".I had to change my dream when the basement caught fire because of my experiments,and my accent was bred out of me at a Catholic boarding school. You ought to know that you're getting ripped off with a lousy set. Look at the actors,you'll see that most of the actors,most of the songs,most of the skits, and most of the episodes,too,are missing...even from the ad. If you were familiar with the show,you should know better than get ripped off like this. If you're not,remember-the show was terrific,no matter how much this set screws it up. It fits right in with my collection of the corniest monster movies ever,like The Little Shop Of Horrors,The Fly,The Blob,and The Mole People or The Vikings And The Sea Serpent,Teenage Caveman and others. Believe me,corny is corny,but if it's corny enough it's worth watching,which is what I like about this. Boseman did a great job of  acting & singing right. And he did enough research to be a perfect James Brown,too. And,like the real guy,the James Brown in the movie has an ego that's bigger than God. He may not be Clint Eastwood,but he played a whole different kind of person,and there's no doubt that if they were around in his day,Scott could easily have taken the lead role in some of Eastwood's Old West films. He's a more believable one,anyway,because he plays a cowboy with more than zero knowledge about anything but guns...in his films you find him knowing ranching,cattle,herding,Indians,girls,dry goods,the law,or,in some cases, several of those. A little far-fetched,even for the Doctor,but good enough to hold your attention. It has a few twists that might be considered far ahead of their time,too,because drug lords weren't  that big of a problem yet. She was a great actress/comedienne,but she was okay here,and she was at her funniest in season 6. That doesnt mean this isn't worth watching or that it's not funny,because most of the episodes are both worth watching and funny. I don't mind that parts of it were written by a 13 year old...it's the scenery and the acting that counts. Sure,it makes movies like Bono Goes To College eem like award winning films,but that's what I like about them-theyre Class Z movies,corny to the max,and proud of it! A woman of her time,1 of the first to do something like this. And she had the right idea,too. The studio wanted her to do several more episodes (I think it was 11),but she decided to get out while her show was still 1 of the best-that's class). If you want a movie that's really bad and cheesy-on purpose-this is one of the best. If you're looking for quality or something more than just mindless,this isn't where you'll find it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3NYLVMP922AE5," They say this is a classic. I guess I can see why, but I truly did not like this movie. Way too indie for me. Too many artsy undertones. And it was like one big music video. Such a great movie. I saw this years ago and was infatuated with it. It was released on the heels of Jaws I believe. Nowadays I guess this type of film would be considered a knock off of the other fish movie but I do not see it that way. Its in a league all its own. This is a freakin classic. I remember watching this flick every time it appeared on the movie channels. People have to remember that ultimately its a lighthearted film but with a kick...literally. GREAT movie!  But I will say the over $60 price tag is not worth it. Try to find it elsewhere. This is the first time I saw this movie. I really enjoyed this. I do enjoy JJ Abrahms new movies but there is something about the ones that keep you interested. Excellent story with great Pixar animation. I read a reviewer said it does not fit the Pixar story standards. Not true. Excellant original story that Pixar is famous for. Great addition to the Pixar family. This is the first time I saw this movie. I really enjoyed this. I do enjoy JJ Abrahms new movies but there is something about the ones that keep you interested. This movie was too funny. It took me a long time to get up enough desire to watch it because it just looked so stupid. But I am glad I did. I can't get enough of it now. I watch portions of it almost everyday. This is what I imagined Vanilla Ice to be like in his heyday. This movie can be a bit slow. When I started studying 3D visual effects some years ago I was told that this film used some elements of Autodesk Maya so I had to see. Not bad but again, slow at times. Actually I considered Blade Runner quite slow but it was still entertaining like this movie. Is it worth seeing? I think so. This Anime is ALL THAT!!!...A coworker of mine hip me to this about a year or two ago. But I never got a chance to see it. It appeared on Netflix and watched the whole series. But now that I see it on Blu, for this price...I MUST HAVE IT!!! This film was GREAT! It definitely rivals the Marvel animated films that have come out recently. How they drew the character is still typical DC style like Superman Doomsday. The animators created a new look for her, extremely beautiful and streamlined. I hated the character Steve Trevor. I know they were trying to portray the male as the ""lesser being"" if you will, but he was just plain corny.  Overall, this film is a more than worthy purchase. Well, I really can't give this 4 or 5 stars because the movie had to grow on me. I initially thought, what a piece of crap. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because I respect the effort put in with the animation. A bit amateurish but tolerable. I have avoided this Blu like the plague while perusing video stores. I thought, here is another horror movie about a little girl, so what? One day while watching HBO this movie came on. I decided to give it a try. My perceptions of this movie was TOTALLY wrong. This flick kept my interest from beginning to end. The suspense was major. And the twist was great. This is well worth the purchase. This movie has such a strong story. My friend thought it was a bit too slow and intellectual for his kids but I don't see how. Many children love this movie. Soundtrack is very nice. And the visuals in this flick are amazing. If an artist does not get inspiration from watching this movie they are out of their mind. Great buy. I really wanted to like this film. You get to some parts where you think okay, there is gonna be an interesting twist or some sort of positive ending. Nothing. Liam is extremely talented. And Ricci was great as well. Just the story lacked BIG TIME. This Anime is ALL THAT!!!...A coworker of mine hip me to this about a year or two ago. But I never got a chance to see it. It appeared on Netflix and watched the whole series. But now that I see it on Blu, for this price...I MUST HAVE IT!!! Great movie but I wish they did not put so much eyeliner on Superman. Sometimes he's a bit disturbing to look at. I know every artist has there own spin on Superman but geeesh. How in the world can anyone give this film over 2 stars? It's one of the worse I have seen in a while. Much was predicted as far as the scares. The only thing I can credit the movie in not doing was using sound to try and scare the audience like in today's thriller/horror films. This is nowhere near a 4 star movie. The storyline could have been so much better. This is about a soldier who chose saving a woman over a colony of people. And he had the nerve to get honors for it and still call himself some kind of soldier. Don't get me wrong, I don't normally look this deep into animated movies but come on. Not great at all. This was not bad. I enjoyed the intro to Brainiac. I wish they were able to be more consistent with Superman's voice though. Tim Daly is THE best voice for Superman but oh well. I guess you have to give other actors an opportunity. I enjoyed this. Atlantis The Lost Empire was one of Disney's greatest movies. But part 2 Milo's Return? Oh my goodness, that movie is hideous. Not sure why they gave this film the green light. I am glad they brought back the voices of the supporting cast but the person playing Milo was AWFUL. Michael J Fox as Milo was much needed. It was not written well and even the animation was bad. This limited edition is wonderful. The only downside is that the tin that doubles for a an art piece to place on your desk is really big. But good thing is if you want to use the tin for something else you can. This is THE perfect gift for anyone. I personally bought it for myself. :-) What a horrible movie. Poor voice casting for Tony Stark. EXTREMELY corny lines and humor. And this sensitivity with the Hulk was atrocious. And for whatever reason the sound in some parts of the movie was not dubbed well. Marvel animated films usually smashes DC movies, but this one? Weak!! Oh man, I am a true Riddick fan. My coworkers said over and over again that another Riddick film would not be made after Chronicles. But I had faith. And sure enough, here it is. Great flick! Why in the world did this take so long to be released? This was one of the most ground breaking shows. The first time Billie Jean was performed by Micheal Jackson? Oh my!! I can't believe this earned such high marks with viewers. This was not all that great. I watched the premiere at the San Diego Comic Con and was actually bored. I hate that they went back to the old DC animation style. They were doing so well. And violence was a bit weak. I'm all for it in a comic movie but this was just overkill. Was not really impressed with this film. Not much Spartan love at all. In fact they are kinda looked upon as an old style of soldier. Ridley Scott could have stamped his name on something better than this. I love the creators of the film along with the Secret of Kells. The imagery is amazing and the story sounds like some sort of local folk tale. Well worth the view. Its amazing reviewers had all of this negative talk before this was even released. Geeeesh. Anyway!!...his fan loves this. You just cannot beat this. George as usual added some digital goodness to this already excellent movie experience. I am a fanboy to the core. If you have a 1080p you will love this even more. This in no way shape or form visually compares to the Marvel movies like Dr. Strange, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk Vs etc. The voices were horrible and the story line was sub par. No wonder I saw this on sale for $5. The only reason I gacve it two stars was because I know the effort it takes to do an animation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2NJPYDDCWCLDX," Sometimes you just need that good chick flick.  This movie has so much to offer, fantastic cast, great plot, humor, and saddens.  I think it needs to come with a ""WARNING: BOX OF TISSUES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"".  If you need a laugh and a VERY good cry, this is one I will recommend any day of the week. My brothers and I grew up watching Mel Brooks movies.  Nothing will ever beat his bests (Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein) but this movie will not disappoint, it has the same slapstick comedy, fantastic cast, and well...it's Mel Brooks, do I need to say more? Johnny Depp was born to play this role.  This movie never gets old.  The book was great and usually they ruin it with a movie version but not this one.  It is like being in a crazy rollercoaster of a trip the whole time. I read the book so many years ago and forgot most of it, once I started watching the book came back into my head and I will have to say that they did a good job.  I love the cast and the story line.  It is a wonderful feel good chick flick. I took a gamble and ordered a copy that was used and had the description stating that it was like new.  The movie arrived prior to the delivery date and was exactly as the description said. This has been one of my favorite movies growing up and am so happy to have found one in this condition and it was a special edition with some fun extras :-)  Thank you. I have grown up with the Muppets and after running all over town looking for it I was excited to find this on here.  It was in mint condition and arrived before the estimated date.  Will order from this company again and recommend them to others I saw this movie on my very first date. Everyone in my family love Sherlock Holmes so this was a must see. So happy to finally have it on DVD & Blu-ray. So many great memories come back when I watch it. I did try to name my kitten who is part Siamese part American Bobtail Fidget bc of this movie (he has ears like a bat). Timeless movie This has been one of my favorite Christmas movies EVER.  I felt like I was 5 years old again when I found it on here.  There are a few scenes that are a little different, some longer, some shorter but still as great as I remember.  I still have it on VHS and it feels strange not having the Kraft commercials and the other old Christmas commercials. If you are a Paul Walker (R.I.P) fan and loved him in the Fast and Furious movies, then you will enjoy this.  It is action packed.  The first 20-30 mins is really just the set up so it is sort of slow but then picks up and doesn't let up till the very end.  As always Paul Walker gives a stellar performance. There were some funny parts, but in all honesty...I think it is one of those you have to watch a few times before it grows on you.  The cast is amazing and lines every well delivered.  It is more of a dark comedy. My friends and I grew up on this show.  Seasons 1 and 2 were the only ones that were released in the states so when I found this box set with all 5 seasons (even though season 5 was never dubbed) along with the 3 movies, I was beyond stoked.  When I got into season 3 I realized why they only released the 1st 2 in the States haha. This has been one of my favorite Disney movies growing up and am so happy to have found one in this condition and it was a special edition.  I took a gamble and ordered a copy that was used and had the description stating that it was like new.  The movie arrived prior to the delivery date and was exactly as the description said. :-)  Thank you. Yes it has a silly story line and silly antics with that feel good ending, but I still had to have it in my collection.  It has a very diverse cast who all work so well together. Gotta love sophomoric humor some times.  Sometimes you need a comedy that, in all honesty, doesn't make you explain the humor to someone you are watching it with b/c it went over their head.  There are days where you need a real laugh out loud, ridiculous comedy. There are many movies about the Civil War but this one is different.  It is heart warming and sad at the same time.  It makes you think about what you would do during that time and put yourself in the characters shoes.  No matter how many times I watch it, it still makes me cry. It doesn't matter what religion you are, this movie is hysterical.  If you can handle a lot of what Mel Brooks dishes out in his movies then this won't offend you LOL. This is a sweet holiday movie.  It has a stellar cast who all give fantastic performances.  I never like to write what the movie is about because I don't want to ruin it for anyone.  I believe if you like sweet and heartwarming films this is one for your collection.  I have been down on love lately but I still enjoyed watching this. I usually don't get into these types of movies but sometimes you need to curl up with a pint of ice cream and enjoy a chick flick And yeah can they really dance, it is awesome to see. Johnny Depp was born to play this role.  This movie never gets old.  The book was great and usually they ruin it with a movie version but not this one.  It is like being in a crazy rollercoaster of a trip the whole time. Johnny Depp was born to play this role.  This movie never gets old.  The book was great and usually they ruin it with a movie version but not this one.  It is like being in a crazy rollercoaster of a trip the whole time. This is a very interesting movie.  I will not spoil the movie for those who have yet to see it.  I am a huge Paul Walker fan and he did a wonderful job in this role.  If you are looking for something different and interesting with many twists and turn, than this is a movie you should have in your collection. It is a heist movie that in some ways remind me of Oceans 11.  It is a good movie if you like action and heist movies.  I hate putting any parts regarding the plot for those who have not seen it.  You can rent it on here if you want to check it out first.  That is what I did and liked it so I now have it in my collection. I may be 33 but there are days where I need to escape into fantasy and this is a great movie to do just that.  It is cute and has some interesting plot twits.  They did a great job with the cast and the story line.  It is a cute movie to watch with the whole family. Well my title says it in a nutshell.  It is a total chick flick that has a really sweet yet funny story line.  Come on girls, you know that deep down EVERYONE has a spot dedicated to chick flicks in your movie collection. I have all of the others, which I love but...this I have to be honest any say that it is not the best one.  It has it's parts and yes the very sexy Johnny Depp, but yeah...I can't say that I love this one.  Please don't get me wrong it is still a good movie to watch and to own.  I was disapointed at first, but after watching it a few times it kind of grew on me. This movie is made for everyone, such a great movie for a family movie night or just when you are in the mood for a sweet and funny heartwarming movie. I will say this, make sure you heave plenty of tissues. If you liked season one then you will love season two.  The challenges and the cars get even better.  In this season you start to see it become more it's own and not so much like the British version (which is still fantastic) Why is it horror movies/psychological thrillers involving kids creep me out the most? This was kind of campy when it came to the deputy but still gives me the chills. I recommend this movie for anyone who likes psychological thrillers and the 2nd one (think that's creepier than the 1st I love movies that have more than one story in the movie.  They way this is, it seems that each character has their own movie in the movie but how they all come together throughout the movie.  It has a great cast and fantastic soundtrack.  It is kind of a chick flick BUT I can see talking your other half into watching it. It was slow to start and would rate it closer to a B movie.  Had a decent cast and an okay plot line.  I am happy to have as part of my extensive collection.  It arrived in mint condition before the estimated delivery date.  I recommend this seller to others. Absolutely hysterical.  If you like spaghetti westerns and tons of humor, than this is a movie for you.  It is far from a family movie, very strong language and some of the content is highly unsuitable for the young. Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday so it is still in a box in the closet hiding. Exactly as described, I did shake the case to double check it didn't get loose in the case during shipping but didn't make a sound. Not a huge Keanu Reeves fan but it is a really good movie with great action scenes. I can't wait for him to open it then he will be watching it almost everyday. When the reruns started playing on TV it made me remember how funny this show was.  Can't believe it has taken this long for it to come out on DVD.  Quality is great, original opening theme. Fun to see Ryan Reynolds when his career took off, same with Nathan Fillion, Time to binge watch one of my favorite shows from the 90's. Not as creepy as I hoped but still gave me chills. If you like psychological thrillers than I suggest this one. Watched it on Amazon Video and purchased it right after. Highly interesting case. Watch all 3 to get every bit but this one sums it all up and brings it to a ""close"". When you watch you will understand the quotes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1TDR1GBXXOZ06," This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Have it on VHS and have almost worn it out. Wanted it on DVD and am so glad I did. Great movie. Has every emotion you could imagine from happiness, saddness, comedy, etc. If you've never seen it you're in for a treat. One of the best tear jerker movies ever !!!  Have watched this so many times over the years, including seeing it at the movies and was anxious to have it in my DVD collection. One of Goldie Hawns best ever. Love her and Kurt Russell together in this. Have seen it so many times over the years and never get tired of it.  Cute storyline, lots of laughs !! Love this movie. Had it on VHS and wanted it on DVD, so just purchased it for that main reason. Am anxious to watch it again soon. Have probably watched it in the past over 8 times. One of the best tear jerker movies ever !!!  Have watched this so many times over the years, including seeing it at the movies and was anxious to have it in my DVD collection. Got this because we always loved the series. Haven't had a chance to see the entire series but the ones we have seem so boring for some reason.  Not much mystery to them. Guess we're spoiled with shows like ""Castle"".  However, it is fun to see James Garner again. Always loved him in anything he was in. Love Marlo Thomas in ""That Girl"". Got season one a month or so ago and enjoyed it so much had to get the next one. Was very dissatisfied with the condition of the cardboard case. It came all torn and looks horrible. Haven't had a chance to watch all the DVD's yet and am hoping they play alright. Was such fun watching this DVD.  I had always loved ""That Girl"" and getting to see it again after so many years was a complete joy.  Also loved the remarks Marlo Thomas made about making the series,etc.  Will eventually have to get the remaining series. I wasn't that thrilled with this movie. Had expected it to be really good but for some reason it just didn't appeal to my husband and I.  When it was over we just looked at each other and kind of sighed. Love Leonardo. Excellent actor, but this movie just didn't appeal to us. Yet, I've heard so many friends who've seen it say they loved it.  So be your own critic. Thought Michael Douglas did an excellent job as Liberace. Can see why he got an award for it. Matt Damon was great,too.  Story was interesting. Wish it had delved more into Liberace's prior life but all in all it was good. Fun to see how he lived. What luxury !!! Excellent !! Loved seeing the Israeli prime minister giving the tour of his beloved country.  We're going to show it in church one Wednesday night and everyone is looking forward to it.  Let my Pastor borrow it and he loved it,too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ," Worst movie ever. The first 15 minutes was too long and showed what a piece of junk this is. A good song is shown in the first minute. 15 minutes is too long for a movie to be complete junk. best movie i've seen for a long time. it gets slightly boring but just a few minutes otherwise the entire movie is very very intelligent well acted great story you name it. Congrats to the producers & actors. ok, some minimal thrill but not worth spending the time watching it. The so called humor was ineffective. The scene with the cowboy riding the bomb down was a sad reminder of the cowboy diplomacy that's been running the country for 8 years. I did manage to see the whole drama but it was slow and boring. The pictures were sometimes interesting. Nice country side. Not worth spending 2.25 hours on it unless you play guitar at same time... fascinating first 10 minutes but the rest is very boring. the zulu wedding ceremony dance is incredible and beautiful. the rest forget  it. I would recommend this movie just for the first 10-15 minutes. I didn't like the music. Didn't like the movie. Boring. Liked some of the artists (Van M. & Ringo). I paged through the chapters. Had no interest at all in what these guys were saying while smoking and they all looked kind of depressing. first i loved this movie - started so so so funny but it kind of fell into pieces to the point i couldn't handle watching the rest so there you have it ... I didn't like this that much - parts are ok but in general it's too slow and something about it I don't like - so fast forwarded after 10 minutes and got done with it quickly. Gave this 3 stars but in its own time it was probably a 5 star movie. Some time related stuff makes it a bit weaker but overall it's a smart fun movie. I love country music. The music in this film is utterly boring. The story is utterly nonsense. The rest is totally boring. Couldn't get through half of it barely and didn't want to even fast forward the rest. very light cheap movie not worth spending any time watching - fast forward helped - but watched enough to be able to give it 2 stars (the nice country music helped bring it up from 1star to 2 stars) I enjoyed this one - fastforwarded through parts but overall a good movie. Funny how I knew some of the parts - must have been from watching it as a kid a long time ago (or maybe not). Excellent acting. G.P. is amazing. O.S., and even T.S. were good too. And the babe is nice. This movie has some funny parts but overall it is one of those bad movies what should have never been made. I don't like movies like this which is an insult to the intelligence of the audience. Very capturing and engaging. The violence is not nice to see but otherwise it's an amazing movie. Definitely one of the best movies ever made. And the music... I love the theme. It's a bad movie - weak in delivering a message and in summary a waste of time - not recommended -- far forward helps if you want to get through it :) It might be a good movie for teenagers but for me - NO THANKS If it weren't for the gorgeous actress I'd fast forwarded through it much more liberally.  A good movie needs more than a gorgeous actress. Natural settings were nice. Otherwise too boring for me. I wouldn't recommend this movie. bought it because of  Scarlett Johansson who was the best part of the movie. the rest is tedious and not that interesting. needed more than fast forward to get done with it. The acting is very good. The scenes are interesting. DVD quality is not that good. Historical depiction but involves lots of war scenes so if you're into non-violence it can be hard to watch so many people get killed. a total junk and waste of time nonsense. not recommended. thank god for the fast forward feature. it was obvious from the beginning this would be a disaster and it was. Mdchen Amick is hot - pretty face  -- but it takes more than a beautiful face to make a great movie. This is a light movie - first 20 minutes are fascinating but then it's downhill and good for a fast forward. I would not recommend this movie. Not homogeneous. Beginning and end belong to two different movies. Ok, the last scene was touching and some of the scenes were quite engaging but overall I did not enjoy it that much. Extremely boring movie - fast forwarded and then just stopped it - but did give it a chance. I guess if you're in a retirement home you may enjoy it but no thanks. Not recommended. one of the most boring films ever made. watched it while doing other things and still it was senseless :) --  I guess I bought it because of the actress who looks like a friend. It's a stupid movie if you ask me and a waste of time - fast forwarded through half of it after giving it a chance. Don't like M. Gibson any more after his drunk rantings that showed his psychological state - superficial and shallow. I enjoy films that depict this epoch and this one relived this period quite and parts of it were very engaging. But I am against all forms of pornography and I do not support movies that show drugs, violence because these do not contribute to a better society and young people who see movies with violence and drugs, etc., get wrongly influenced. Just an ok movie. It's kind of interesting, but certainly not a great movie. The acting is good. It exposes an important corrupt element of US financial markets which goes on as we speak and SEC was asleep on the wheel for 8 Bush years (not a single case of naked shorting was prosecuted). loved this movie. it was subtle, gentle, intelligent, great acting, just the right balance of everything. I can't believe people rate all kinds of junk 5 star and this one has a 3 star average :) too funny. This is nonsense galore. I bought it for Kate's sake. Tried to follow the movie but best I could do was to fast forward because this is a completely nonsense waste of time movie. I would not recommend it. Waste of money. only got the documentary (disk 2 - additional features) and not the disk itself.  (watched the documentary and wasn't impressed by the main character -- as she's beginning to sing she asks for cigarettes :) ) This film prides itself for promoting ugliness. Disgusting looking natives on the island and disgusting fictional animals and lots of violence. Waste of time and money. The animation was impressive but I don't recommend this movie. usually I would fast forward through this kind of nonsense but watching it with a friend we just resorted to using faster play speed once we realize what a piece of trash this movie is.  It starts find and fun but quickly dives into endless nonsensical conversations and extremely boring and predictable plot. This is a true story, it happens all the time, the sex gurus and non sex gurus who take advantage of gullability, spiritual poverty, and thirst for something more to expolit others. But it's ultimately the fault of their followers for being so shallow. Okay, so maybe there are 4 or 5 clever jokes here that I laughed at. But for the most part this is a loud, cliched, predictable idiotic film that is a total waste of a lot of talented actors. Shallow.....no substance... stupid story about comparison... a sickness of society........ and psychological BS. If it wasn't for the Jennifer Aniston I would stop it much sooner...  This is one of those stupid movies that is the worst HW pounds out........... with repeat nonsense jokes that might make a moron laugh.  The more I watched the stupider I got. Finally pulled the plug. Of course I wasn't wasting time watching it exclusively. It's not worth a MINUTE. Teaches kids irresponsibility, promotes smoking, teaching them brutality, drug use, theft, comparison, superficiality, premature sexual activity, lying, bad behavior, cussing, corruption, self abuse, self cutting, underage drinking and defeats its own purpose of showing what bad influence can do in your life. boring mediocre at best. It's not that there aren't stellar moments, especially within the performances, but overall I felt that the film's construction was weak and thus the overall film is weak. Very entertaining. Disk 4 ""parents"" episode is the best (extremely funny). I loved the whole series except troubled by the moral example it sets by lies after lies (which is not good). Honeysuckle is better than pure country but still couldn't get through it. the music is much better - but both films are very boring. Not recommended. See my review under pure country as well a light movie good for kids and teachers to watch perhaps - I find it too light and uninteresting so couldn't go through the whole thing but admire the story and do believe a good teacher can make a world of difference. The idea of reconciliation and completing loose ends is good but many don't have a second chance after they die!  a soso movie with a peaceful feel except when the psychological monster fights with her sister. a boring weak story that just gets going after minute 25 but anything that takes that long to start the theme is good for fastforward :) sorry don't mean to be cruel but couldn't handle this movie. I wanted to like this - was first engaging - good acting - but the plot is too predictable and somewhat boring - I did manage to more or less watch the whole thing but would not recommend it. It's at best an average movie. It does show some genuine human emotions which is nice. it was not italian - it was russian or something - I Didn't like it - not my type of movie - kind of boring - I don't recommended it - fast forward helped. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Congrats to Mr. Panahi and the rest of the crew -- incredible job. The story is simple yet very capturing and if you're lucky to hear it in original language you'll enjoy it much more because of the sweet azari and mashadi etc. accents Just an ok movie. It's kind of interesting, but certainly not a great movie. The acting is good. It exposes an important corrupt element of US financial markets which goes on as we speak and SEC was asleep on the wheel for 8 Bush years (not a single case of naked shorting was prosecuted). This movie robs you off your precious time. It's nonsense from the beginning but it sucks you in and leaves you hanging. The crime brutality blood violence is TOOOOOOOO MUCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHH. Avoid this movie. a fun  movie.  i  enjoy African American culture, dialect, songs, worship, etc.. I was skeptical about this movie in the beginning but it caught my attention and was a fun watch with a moral point. Just an ok movie. It's kind of interesting, but certainly not a great movie.

I was skeptical about this movie in the beginning but it caught my attention and was a fun watch with a moral point. awful - it was obvious it's not interesting from the beginning -- but I let it roll and it just got worse -- time to put it out of its misery. Stop button! crappy story crappy everything - total junk - couldn't stand it - fast forwarded - jumped chapter - even then didn't make it to the end - junk food for minds of kids don't know why I bought this - had forgotten that i'd seen it and must have bought it for the sake of Scarlett Johansson who's a babe. Anyway I don't like this movie because it's decadent. Captivating movie. I never thought I'd give a 4 or 5 star to a movie that has killing like this but the guys killed deserved to be killed :) The movie is well done. Great acting. Intelligent story. Enough said. Good movie but after 40 minutes I fast forwarded it (too busy) and not motivated to see a grumpy old man frown for another hour - but the parts I watched were capturing so I'd say this is a good movie. as unintelligent as a movie can get - thank god for fast forward - and of course not dedicated watching - something to practice guitar with but still worthless junk that got stopped soon. I enjoyed this movie  can speed up the play in a few spots but otherwise it was very funny in some spots and had a good story and lots of gorgeous women. gave it a 3 star out of respect for kung Fu and Bruce Lee. Otherwise not much to write home about. It's not a bad light movie if you like kung fu. I liked Bruce Lee better :) I would not recommend this movie. It is pretty bad - a bad weak story - unintelligent plot. If you have time to waste and want to see mindless action go for it. ok movie - a bit slow but tolerable and entertaining. I don't like the way Anna Kendrick talks: total loss of femininity that is so common in US among some women. first 20 minutes i got some good laughs despite it being a stupid movie and then it went down hill and into mind games stuff which is not only a bad influence for people but i have zero interest in. so fast forwarded chapters to a quick eject after the first 30 minutes. Not the best documentary ever made on John Lennon but what it does show from the life of this great artist is well worth a watch for Beatles/Lennon fans and scholars. It's an engaging movie but I'd rather not have seen it because of the violence. And the talk scenes are too slow and don't fix the holes in the plot. Otherwise a good movie. Watching such a very long movie with subtitles is not my cup of tea. Had some interesting scenes... killing the cow was cruel and very brutal. Can we live without such violence? complete nonsense - lots of holes in the story like the fired guy being in same suite and tie 6 am the next morning and the rest - unfortunately i watched the whole thing (while doing other things). this is a fantastic documentary about the life of an amazing man. many people don't know that george sang on a lot more beatles songs than people think. too bad he died from smoking. really enjoyed this movie. He wrote 2 of the best beatles songs ever something here comes the sun i heard so many good things about this that i paid full price for a new DVD -- it was ok -- ok, good movie but not a great movie at all. Bland, Unfocused Effort is a good way someone put it. It's an alright movie. I like Bob's music but if anything this movie shows that this life style is not healthy. The biographical points were interesting. Captivating movie. I never thought I'd give a 4 or 5 star to a movie that has killing like this but the guys killed deserved to be killed :) The movie is well done. Great acting. Intelligent story. Enough said. Good movie but after 40 minutes I fast forwarded it (too busy) and not motivated to see a grumpy old man frown for another hour - but the parts I watched were capturing so I'd say this is a good movie. This film prides itself for promoting ugliness. Disgusting looking natives on the island and disgusting fictional animals and lots of violence. Waste of time and money. The animation was impressive but I don't recommend this movie. boring. it starts as very interesting but gets pretty dull and boring a third of the way through. skipped the rest of the chapters by fast forwarding - not worth spending the time Shame on the producers for such a junk movie, junk story, promoting decadence, irresponsible behavior, and just everything that is disgusting. Aside from that the movie was a total waste of time and junk - not even fun - not even funny - not even sexy - not even nothing not nothing nadda -- junk! If you don't expect much from this movie you won't get disappointed. Don't dedicate time to see it; anotherwords, multi-task like play guitar or eat while watching it, and then you haven't wasted your time, yet got a glimps of the epoque which this movie well represents. third class movie -- definitely not worth spending time exclusively to watch it - for multi-tasking is ok - even then somewhat stupid - but some nice parts too therefore not 1 star. It's a very absorbing movie yet very depressing. It's very artfully done. It's kind of sick. Some of the punch lines are too much - e.g. the rich guy joking about blood of woman's period and virginity (both cases was too crude and unnecessary). I would not recommend this movie unless you're into some major depression. as a background tasks it's not bad - has some interesting scenes and dialogues - I didn't like the fat American woman trying to convert the Afghans into her culture but I am fully for women rights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A34HI5V0AKH5S," This film, along with a few others, managed to capture that moment in history when a counter culture emerged during the 1960's and early 1970's.  Needless to say, it made many in the ""Establishment"" nervous.  The drug scene was a bit overblown but the long haired prejudice was all too real. Liz Taylor and Paul Newman are two of my favorite actors.  Based on the Tennessee Williams play, the acting brings the story to life with all the intensity of a truly disfunctional southern American family.  I bought it for my collection of classics. I have loved this movie since it first opened, way back when.  I have felt it was a true classic and wanted to have a copy for my collection.  One of Paul Newman's best. This is a fabulous collection of films covering the rise and fall of a powerful Mafia family.  The casting and recreation of events were very well done.  I bought this as a gift. Stallone, in his portrayal of Rocky, the classic underdog, gathered the support of audiences around the world.  While only a fictional character, Rocky's quest became ours;  we too could fight and perhaps win a battle of our own.  While perhaps drawn out too long by the final chapter, Rocky's story was the story of our dreams and aspirations. The actors, Paul Giamatti, Laura Linney and Tom Wilkenson all turned in outstanding performances and made Season 1 a must watch historical drama. The depiction of historical America was superb - raw, very basic, and not at all glamorous. As an emerging nation, America started from scratch, there was no political infrastructure at all.  Those were some pretty difficult times. Stallone, in his portrayal of Rocky, the classic underdog, gathered the support of audiences around the world.

Hopefully, it inspires couples to rekindle what they once had.  I bought it to share with a few couples I know. Once again, we see a major violent criminal whose family seems to have no clue as to his true character and source of extraordinary wealth.

A3HBT2LJ06CZZS," Who couldn't love Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee. This movie is a classic and the music sore aweome. I watch this movie a lot. You just can't get enough of this classic. Love all six of the movies. I ordered these a long time ago and just now giving a review. These movies are classics that will go on for years and years. Why is this movie broken up and you have to turn the DVD over to continue the movie. I was shocked that more effort wasn't put into getting this movie all on one side. Other than that, I love the movie!!!! Gosh! This movie is a classic! I love ""The Little Mermaid"". I took my daughter to see it when she was 4 years old and now it's her daughters favorite movie! My husband loves this movie, so I bought it for him. He loves it. I do watch it with him. We'll most likely contiune to watch it many times over. Or he will. I love scifi and Tom Cruise, with whom I believe is a wonderful actor in anything he does. I just wish people would see the person and not the religion he lives by. I am a Christian and we are not to judge people rudely or fausely. The movie I felt was slow moving, but still a wonder to watch. I will watch this movie for many years to come. Watched ""A Bride for Christmas"" and loved it. I bought it at a great price and got another movie to boot. I watched that one too, but the other movie is better. I will continue to watch this movie over and over again at Christmas and beyond. A classic and the perfect people to play the charaters. Please keep up the great work! Did you notice that the man who played Mr. Kirk for that first 8 minutes of the movie is played by none other than Chris Hemsworth. I thought he did a great job even then, but who knew what he would become in the future. THOR! The Best one they ever made from all the Twilight Movies. The director made time to explain why both Rose and Jasper's stories about how they became who they are. It was awesome just to see those few minutes explained. I loved this movie and watch it many times. This movie had a lot of action. Miss Jolie is a wonderful actress.  I felt the movie was little over the top for me. I will of course see it again, but not as much as I see my other movies. I bought the movie and after it was all said and done. I shreded the movie after I watched it. Let's just keep it at that. I don't wish to explain. I was extremely dissapointed that Channing Tatum character died in the film. Once that happened it become just another movie. The movie was ok. I don't watch it all that much, JJ Abrams did it again!!!! This film will be a classic for years and years to come. We watch this movie all the time too. I am a movie person. This movie is off the charts great!!!! Who could not love Van Disel or Paul Walker and the whole cast! I love this movie and will cherish it forever. We watch it all the time. When I found out that Paul Walker died. I cried. I will certainaly will watching, Fast Seven when it comes out. This movie rocked!!!!! A classic and the perfect people to play the charaters. Please keep up the great work! Did you notice that the man who played Mr. Kirk for that first 8 minutes of the movie is played by none other than Chris Hemsworth. I thought he did a great job even then, but who knew what he would become in the future.

A1AT4OFBVBVL6Q," I bought this as a gift for my mom and step-dad.  Neither of them had seen it before.  We are all from the south and I knew that they would see so much in this movie that reminded them of our younger days in the old south.  They both loved it and laughed hysterically when they told me how much they enjoyed watching it.  Another great product at a great price. One of my all time favorite movies and my favorite ""go to"" guilty pleasure movie.  The story is an old Hollywood paradigm, but never done so well as this.  The cast is superb, the dialogue is epic and the music is inspiring.  Yet another great value. Although much of this movie qualifies as ""chees"" and even ""propaganda"".....I still love it.  It was well made and although a difficult subject for those of us who served in this ""little war"" it still holds up as a great movie well worth watching over and over.  Check your politics at the door and just enjoy the ride.  And, of course, it has......John Wayne. This is simply one of the best cast, best acted, best made films I've seen.  I've probably seen this movie a hundred times, but it never gets old or tired.  I consider it to be one of the two best performances of Henry Fonda's fabled career.  The supporting cast is nothing short of stellar and the story is so well written.  It is pure, cinematic genius and a good watch for all ages. For anyone who loves surfing, as I do, this is a ""must have"" for your movie collection.  Great performances and great panoramic of some of the best waves in the world. Andy Griffith has to be one of the finest comedic actors ever.  This movie is timeless.  No matter how many times I see it...it leaves me in stitches every time.  It never gets old and it never fails to deliver the laughs.  Good, family fun or a simply fun, by yourself watch. This is my favoriet Cagney film.  Cagney plays the late, great actor Lon Chaney Sr. who was a master of disguise and a wonderful actor.  Cagney gives an impassioned performance of a man filled with talent, but burdened with personal hardships and tragedies.  It is one of those rare films that you will want to watch again and again. This is one of my favorite old movies.  I have seen it many times over the years, but it is so much better to have it on a quality disc without the interruption of commercials.  Yet another great product at a great price that I will enjoy again and again for many years. This is one of those movies that I remember from my youth that I love to remember and was very pleased to see it available in video.  It is a very funny movie and a wonderful addition to anyone's collection who loves both westerns and comedies. Nightwing is a classic horror film.  I enjoyed it now just as I enjoyed it when I saw it in the theater when it first came out.  For horror buffs, this is a ""must have"" and a very well made movie for its genre. This is a movie that is quite literally timeless.  It is a visual stunner and the dialogue is simply outstanding.  An action thriller that has existential content, eye candy action and electric chemistry between several members of the cast.  An absolute must for anyone's collection who loves a movie that won't let you up for air from start to finish. Being a southerner I've seen this kind of corruption up close and personal.  This movie is very dark, but it is also very, very good.  The cast is stellar and the story has more twists than a labyrinth.  Anyone who likes a complicated, suspense thriller will enjoy this film. I bought this to replace the one that I loaned out and didn't get back.  I love all of the ""Dead"" movies and have them all.  I watched this again the day after it arrived and enjoyed it just as I did when I first saw it in the theater when it first came out.  For those who love horror movies....this is one of the best and is a ""must have"" for your collection. This is another ""blast from my past"".  I saw it when it first came out and had not seen it since.  I've already watched it twice and it is still a great viewing experience....especially for those of us who grew up on the brilliant television series hosted by the late, great Rod Serling.  Another superior product at a great price. I ordered this as a birthday gift for one of my sons.  It is one of my four or five all time favorite movies and I'm sure that he will love it just as I do.  Excellent product at an excellent price. I remember watching this mini-series when it first aired and absolutely loving it.  I had not seen it since its original airing.  Without a doubt.....I enjoyed it even more this time around and I will enjoy it again and again for many years to come.  It treats the story with diligent, historical accuracy and Michael Caine is absolutely incredible.  An outstanding product at a very reasonable price. I saw this when it first came out and loved it.  As a retired Teamster I appreciate it even more as it is loosely based on the 20th century history of the American Labor Movement and the Teamster's rise to prominence.  Stallone turned in an outstanding performance in a very well made movie. This is a movie that is quite literally timeless.  It is a visual stunner and the dialogue is simply outstanding.  An action thriller that has existential content, eye candy action and electric chemistry between several members of the cast.  An absolute must for anyone's collection who loves a movie that won't let you up for air from start to finish. This is one of my favorite movies from my youth.  I saw this when it first came out and it was so far ahead of its time.  It is still a great movie and a ""must have"" for science fiction and fantasy film buffs. As an old surfer, I was already a big fan of both movies.  North Shore is my favorite surfing movie.  I ordered this dvd for one of  my sons as a gift and I am more than sure that he will love it.  He had already seen my dvd of North Shore and loved it and I am quite sure that he will love Blue Crush as well. I loved this show when it was on TV and was very happy to see it come out in video.  It is every bit as good as I remember it.  Another great buy. This was simply one of the best sitcoms to ever grace the small screen.  I don't get tired of it and will enjoy this wonderful product for many years to come.  This is a wonderful product at an outstanding price.  If you love to laugh.....this is a ""can't miss"" buy. I bought this for one of my sons.  This is one of his very favorite television series.  I haven't given it to him yet as his birthday is still a few weeks away, but I have no doubt that he will flip when he opens this up.  Another outstanding product at an extraordinary price.  Well done. I loved this show when it was on television.  The cast was so very unique and the stories so original.  Every week I would laugh myself silly watching the antics of the unusual characters on Newhart.  This is another show that is utterly timeless.  If you love to laugh, this is your show. This was a gift for my folks and they loved it.  It is one of the all time great television shows and a super bargain.  My two favorite episodes are in season three, ""Barney and the Governor"" and ""Man in a Hurry"".  Outstanding product......superb price. I bought this for my wife, but I'll get to enjoy it too.  This was one of the best TV shows from our youth and we will enjoy it for many years to come.  Great bargain. This was one of my favorite shows in my youth and it is still riveting and suspenseful.  It is yet another great product at a very good price.  Love it.....highly recommend it. This was one of the most unique and innovative shows ever to grace the small screen.  Scott Bakula was amazing as Sam Beckett and every show was different.  There was no rut in any of the seasons.  The fourth season is the amazing and continuing saga of Sam and his holographic friend and mentor Al.  If you like science fiction, drama, humor spiced with an amazing touch of humanity.....""Quantum Leap"" is just what you need.  Another wonderful bargain. This was a gift for my wife and she is quite happy with it.  This was one of our favorite shows when we were young.  A nice blast from the past at a very reasonable price. This is a super bargain.  I loved this show when it was on TV and it stands the test of time quite well.  It is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen and I love watching it over and over.  Great price for a great product. A greatly under-rated movie.  I loved it when it first came out and still do.  I ordered 3 of the dvds.....one for myself and two as gifts for two of my sons.  Another great movie at another great price. I bought this for my wife for Valentine's Day, but in truth I will enjoy it as much as she does.  We both loved the show when it was on and we now have the complete series.  It is a wonderful show and we never get tired of watching it.  Another great product, a great price and  delivered early and without a scratch. This was a gift for one of my sons who, like me, is an avid horror film buff.  For anyone who loves good horror movies this is an absolute ""must have"" for your collection.  Great product at a super price. I bought this as a gift.  It was what was asked for and she absolutely loves it.  She has already watched it several times.  Another good product at a good value. This was one of my favorite shows when I was a boy in the '50s.  It is still a very good show.  I'm glad that I found this on a good sale and bought it just before the prices went up.  A good bargain. I cannot adequately review this product as I recieved the wrong product.  I would cost me more to return it than I paid for it so I simply kept the wrong item (of about the same value) and used it as a gift. ""The Man in the Wilderness"" is one of the movies I remember loving when I first saw it in the theater.  A very nice addition to my collection that will be enjoyed many times over the coming years. My dad and I used to watch this show when it first aired.  We never missed it.  I have greatly enjoyed watching it again and it's just as good now as I remember it being way back when.  For those who are World War II buffs, it is a wonderful experience and a very reasonably priced set to add to the collection. I cannot adequately review this product as I recieved the wrong product.

For those who are World War II buffs, it is a wonderful experience and a very reasonably priced set to add to the collection. This is my favorite show on TV right now.  I never seem to get tired of it.  I purchased the third season at a very good price and I am most pleased with it.  Thanks, guys. This is one of the funniest shows ever.  I bought this as a gift for a family member who has only recently discovered the show.  It will be greatly enjoyed.  Great product at a great price. This is not as good as the first movie, but it is easily as good and probably a little better than the second movie.  It is a good watch and a ""feel good"" movie and a ""must have"" for hockey lovers and sports movie lovers. ""Telefon"" is one of Bronson's best performances.  A very well made and exceptionally entertaining movie.  ""St. Ives"" is another great movie from the Bronson archives.  I saw both movies in the theater when they came out and I will enjoy this double feature many times in the coming years. I am admittedly a Peanuts-holic.  I am most especially a Snoopy-holic.  This is simply an epic collection of some of my very best television memories of my youth.  Absolutely first rate.  For anyone who loves the Peanuts gang.....this is a must have. This is my favorite show on television today and one of my favorites all time.  It is, quite simply, superb.  Great product at a very good price and, once again, it came well before the due date. If you are a Kris Kristofferson fan you will most definitely not be disappointed in this movie.  Kris is a consummate actor and one of the best songwriters of my lifetime.  This is yet another good product at a good price from Amazon.  Thanks. I bought this as a gift for one of my sons and he loves it.  It is one of his favorite television series and he enjoys it repeatedly.  Another great product at another great price. My wife and I have watched this show from the beginning.  The first season was outstanding.  I have lost interest in the show now in its current evolution, but I still enjoy watching the first two seasons. I bought this as a gift for one of my children.  It was what he asked for and he loved it.  Good product at a good price with a good result.  Well done. Mr. Magoo is an iconic cartoon from my childhood.  I grew up watching this show and still love it even as I approach senior citizenhood.  This is a great product at a great price for anyone who still likes to re-visit the better parts of their childhood and for those who have never seen it....it's a treat that is well worth the price. I bought this as a gift for one of my sons.  Everybody in my family loves this show.  I have all 10 seasons and can honestly say that there is not one bad episode in any of them.  Another great product at a super price. I bought this as a gift for one of my children and he loved it.  It was what he asked for so I obliged him  with a gift that I knew he would already love.  Nice product at a decent price. Admittedly I have not yet watched ""Rush"".  I ordered this because I wanted ""Who'll Stop the Rain"".  I saw it in the theater when it first came out and loved it.  I have already watched it twice and it is still absolutely epic.  Another great product at a great price from Amazon. I love cheezy, horror films and this does not disappoint.  There is some good acting, but most of it is fairly cheezy as are the special effects.  However, much like the cheezy, horror films I grew up watching at the drive-in.....it is very entertaining and I will enjoy watching it again and again over the years. My wife and I love Hallmark movies, but especially Hallmark Christmas movies.  This is a truly wonderful collection of Christmas movies that we will enjoy again and again.  A wonderful collection at a bargain price. This was a great show from my childhood.  I haven't seen it in such a long time, but it's a great trip down memory lane and a timeless classic comedy.  Another great deal. This show was so far ahead of its time.  Quite obviously it was funny, but it was also a wonderful satire on the various types of people and the odd dynamic that sometimes brings people together as friends and the love/hate dynamic that is so often typical of brothers.  I love the show and will enjoy this product often over the coming years. As a Vietnam veteran I was greatly impressed with this series when it was on television.  It shows a side of the Vietnam experience that is not often portrayed in the documentaries nor is it often talked about among the vets.  This is the final season and the series is a compelling, competent and compassionate treatment of that most difficult time in our history.  Wonderful product at an equally wonderful price. My wife and I love the Hallmark movies.  We both love happy endings and Hallmark makes some of the better Christmas movies.  During the Christmas season we don't change the channel much.  We pretty much watch the Hallmark channel from Thanksgiving through New Year's Day.  This 4 pack is a wonderful collection of ""feel good"" movies that will leave you with that ""warm, fuzzy"" feeling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2DXI8AYJTW7K," Another one of those movies that just makes you feel good with a great cast and wonderful storyline. Another one to add to my classics collection I will cherish it always! My hat goes off to Spike Lee for this movie. Growing up in the City, I could relate to a lot of this. Though maybe not exactly the same era but who's being picky right? I laughed, I cried, I absolutely adored this movie and I say it's a must see! Especially for any Spike Lee fans! Three cheers for both Houston and Costner. I can't get enough of this movie, and will always pull it out every now and again to watch. It takes your emotions into overdrive and you instantly fall in love as these two melt the tv screen with their relationship! I bought this as a gift for a friend who couldn't find it anywhere. I am pleased to say that she is very excited and satisfied to own it. I have had the liberty of watching it myself and must say it's a wonderful movie! I love this movie, and the DVD wasn't for me it was a gift for a friend. But that doesn't change my love for this movie in any way shape or form. Don't let this slip through your fingers, give it a chance! I saw this movie 4...yes 4 times when it was in the theaters and couldn't believe that it was out of print on DVD. But the dark clouds evaporated seeing that it was being rereleased on a new DVD version and jumped on the pre-order list! I love this movie and can't wait til it gets here!! I have loved this movie for as long as I can remember, and upon finding the Special Edition for a great price on Amazon I not only bought it for myself, but a friend as well. Great special features, as well as a great movie in general! I first caught this movie on a movie channel way back when. I must say I was impressed with it then, and go on to still be impressed by it's simple yet eventful nature. It didn't take a lot to put together, but the sheer will power of the teacher and their children to survive the turmoil they're put through makes it a really good movie. Yet another gift I bought for a friend of mine. I've watched it and was surprised at how good it was. I'm a big Shakespeare fan so I get picky at remakes of his plays, but this one passed my test with flying colors! I remember renting this movie way back when I was little and our local video store was actually a VIDEO store...as in VHS. I don't know how many times I rented it, but it was a whole lot. Which is why I was delighted to see the cover again on Amazon and for a DVD no less. I still remembered the songs and couldn't let this one slip through my fingers. A great family classic! One of my favorite Pauly Shore movies of all time! What is crazier than putting Pauly Shore in the army?! No matter how many times I watch it, I still can't help but laugh at all the antics that go on in this movie. Must see! Though it may seem a bit 'cheesy' at times, I actually did like this movie. It reminds me of the Karate Kid though more urban and darker. It had some good acting and a very good cast to say the least. I say it's worth a shot. Forgive me for saying so but WOO can Kiefer Sutherland play a great and believable villain! This movie had chills running down my spine the first time I watched it, and still does from time to time. The scenes are intense and definitely not made for kids, but for us adults out there it's a great crime story and a mother's fight for justice! Gizmo! How can you not love the little Magwi? See, I can't even spell it but I love that little furball! I've been watching this movie for as long as I can remember and don't intend to stop anytime soon. The special edition is just the icing on the cake too. Long live the gremlins! I knew this movie way back from when I was a kid and had a VHS rental store in town. I loved it as much then as I still do, and was tickled pink to find it out on DVD. The little girl in this movie is cute as a button! And watching the bickering 'bad guys' is hilarious! The movie is funny and heartfelt at the same time and I can't stop watching it! Another movie that I'd bought for a friend at their request. I must say that after watching it I was shocked that I'd never watched it before. Now have a new movie that I might plan to purchase one more copy of in the future haha! Another movie I bought for a friend of mine who was looking for it, but I have also viewed this movie and must say I did enjoy it. I liked seeing Christina Ricci, and enjoy a lot of her films. I have loved this movie for as long as I can remember, and upon finding the Special Edition for a great price on Amazon I not only bought it for myself, but a friend as well. Great special features, as well as a great movie in general! Who doesn't love Michael J Fox as a wolf? And who doesn't think of this movie everytime Surfin' USA comes over the radio??? Haha! I was glad to find a double pack of these movies though the first will always be my favorite of course! These movies rank up there with the classics like Puppet Master and Gremlins. It's something about little demonic creatures that are both scary and cute to me haha! Very entertaining and and old cult classic to watch. I love that both of them come together in one package! I admit until I got the double pack I didn't even know this movie had a sequel. The orginal kept me on the edge of my seat when I first watched it and was indeed a very clever concept and will make me think twice before crossing the lines in a wax museum haha! The sequels really good as well and is worth it's price of admission! Like many other kids from the 80's-90's I grew up on this show! I remember way back arguing with friends on who was cuter, Zack or Slater even haha! I couldn't be happier with purchasing this series and being able to live through the laughs and tears of the gang at Bayside High! I was tickled pink to find this on DVD, and snatched it up right away. Great series and you can't help but love all the lessons learned in this series. Back when family tv shows actually had a life lesson that each character learned at the end of each episode...I miss that! I was tickled pink to find this on DVD, and snatched it up right away. Great series and you can't help but love all the lessons learned in this series. Back when family tv shows actually had a life lesson that each character learned at the end of each episode...I miss that! The sitcom that made me LOVE Will Smith and a comedy that I love watching over and over again. Laugh your butt off with all the crazy antics the Fresh Prince brings to Bel-Air. They just don't make sitcoms like they used to haha! I love musicals, and this took the cake for me. The raw comedy in this movie is hillarious and the songs have you singing along as if you were stoned! Haha! I love the cheesy acting that parodies the classic along with the songs. And who couldn't love Ralph?! I absolutely adore Puppet Master so this movie gave me high hopes. While it didn't live up to those 'high' hopes as I'd wanted, it was still a decent watch. The acting in it was...to say the least, had a 'forced' and almost amateur appeal to it which brought down the already low budget feel it gave off.  But I have to admit it was nice seeing the classic Puppets back in action again...even with the upgrades. The sitcom that made me LOVE Will Smith and a comedy that I love watching over and over again. Laugh your butt off with all the crazy antics the Fresh Prince brings to Bel-Air. They just don't make sitcoms like they used to haha! The sitcom that made me LOVE Will Smith and a comedy that I love watching over and over again.

I knew this movie way back from when I was a kid and had a VHS rental store in town. I loved it as much then as I still do, and was tickled pink to find it out on DVD. The little girl in this movie is cute as a button! And watching the bickering 'bad guys' is hilarious! The movie is funny and heartfelt at the same time and I can't stop watching it! I'll admit I've watched this show since I was little. At 28, still can't get enough of it! Great price and great series to watch and enjoy over and over. I love watching the new tricks and gadgets he comes up with to get out of a bind and never tire of it! I am a Stephen King fan to the core. I love all his books, and the movies made from them actually do the book justice...even if the book is better haha! These four are a lovely treat to show just that, chilling and spooky and keeps you on the edge of your seat even if you've already seen them. Can't help but love this four pack! I was tickled pink to find this on DVD, and snatched it up right away. Great series and you can't help but love all the lessons learned in this series. Back when family tv shows actually had a life lesson that each character learned at the end of each episode...I miss that! I was tickled pink to find this on DVD, and snatched it up right away. Great series and you can't help but love all the lessons learned in this series. Back when family tv shows actually had a life lesson that each character learned at the end of each episode...I miss that! My only complaint with this series is that it wasn't long enough! Ron Pearlman melted our hearts as Vincent, the ever poetic and gentle beast as he wooed Katherine and protected her with his life. It's a shame this series couldn't have made ore seasons because I have a feeling they would have been phenomenal! Jack Black strikes again with this concert that is beautifully choreographed and put together. It sucks you in with laughs and rock from the moment the stage lights up. Having it on Blu Ray to experience the beautiful picture quality is the icing on the cake! Jack Black strikes again with this concert that is beautifully choreographed and put together. It sucks you in with laughs and rock from the moment the stage lights up. Having it on Blu Ray to experience the beautiful picture quality is the icing on the cake! How a man can take all the terrible things in his life's goings on and turn it into standup gets a gold medal from me! Titus knocks it out of the ballpark again reminiscing over past and present love stories with hilarious jokes, gestures and voices. I laughed until I cried! I honestly didn't think I'd like this movie when I first watched it, but the storyline hooked me in and I find it to be a great watch for anyone looking for 'something different' so to speak. Any Scream fans out there need to own this! All three movies in one pack, even if the 4th is missing, is a great deal! Watch it from the very beginning of the horror to the sequels that keep spinning the trail of blood! Absolutely love it! I am a big environmentalist and have enjoyed the Lorax story since the old cartoon. The fact that it was made into a full length movie and even modernized grabbed my heart. I can't help but reach out to the child in me and watch this movie from time to time. A must see! This movie has a slightly 'low budget' appeal to it, but all in all I enjoyed it. It was an interesting storyline, I'll give it that. I admit in places the acting or 'suspense' could have been upped. A good buy for any Corey fan or even suspense fan. After seeing this in the movies, I was instantly sold on this movie. A great cast and a great plot that keeps you gripped to your seat. The Blu Ray format brings out all those special effects in gorgeous graphics! Plus the special features on the special edition are a great bonus to watch as well. Only in the older movie era could you take a bunch of 'kids' and make an epic action movie like this! I love the action, suspense and all around appealthis movie gives off and I recommend it to anyone. Grab a copy before they're all gone! This movie takes on a slight ""Tales From the Crypt"" appeal. But as a whole it tells a good tale that gives you a bit of a chill. Not to mention, makes you think twice about joining a Frat! I have to say, I have seen so many movies with this similar/same title that this really made me do the 'really?' eyebrow raise. But, I have to say for yet another rendition of a 'car movie', it's actually pretty well portrayed. Chock another one up for my Feldman collection, I give it a good thumbs up! A fun little family movie with some cheesy comedy and 'alice in wonderland' type feel to it. I remember seeing it on TV years ago and was happy to find it on DVD, boy did it bring back the memories. Good cast and a fun watch!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A22RY8N8CNDF3A," This is a science fiction story about a disparate group of people who attempt to contact aliens. The group includes electrical lineman Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), single mother Jillian whose son disappeared while a UFO was in the area, and a French researcher who thinks we can use music to communicate with aliens. They all meet up at Devil's Tower, Wyoming. 'Stepmom' features the conflict between the ex (Susan Sarandon) and her replacement (Julia Roberts), augmented by the childrens' natural loyalties to their mother. Lots of tart-tongued dialogue in the beginning, with preventable and meaningless conflicts at the PTA, the home, etc. Eventually they come together, drawn by the ex's slow death from cancer. Maudlin, boring, and way too long. This 1997 science fiction film presents a future society in which most children are conceived through genetic manipulation to ensure they possess the best traits of their parents. Those conceived outside the program are discriminated against. The plot is silly, doesn't hold water, isn't even up to current achievements in genetic manipulation, and is boring. Cary Grant plays the role of a man without a job who marries into money to continue his work-free life of gambling. Unfortunately, he grossly overestimates the money his wife will be bequeathed upon her father's death. Joan Fontaine is his wife, and keeps accepting him despite his irresponsible ways. Eventually she becomes concerned that he will murder her for her inheritance. Boring, extremely improbable. Watched this movie because it was directed by Spielberg. Unfortunately, even Speilberg can't fix a dumb plot. It was hard to sit through, but I forced myself so that I could honestly say that I'd seen the entire video. This is not something to waste time or money on. Some interesting points here and there, mostly involving his early life and difficulties with women, but mostly just drags on and on. Robert Downey Jr. was a poor choice to play Chaplin's role. I enjoy the pretentiousness of the supervisors in this series. This DVD brings 'Founder's Day' for young Mr. Grace, a temporary relaxation of stuffiness, the defeat of a takeover attempt, and an effort to push Mr. Grainger out. Fortunately, the latter fails. This film covers about three decades in the relationships between Shirley MacLaine and her daughter, Debra Winger, as well as a shorter picture of MacLaine's relationship with men friends, especially Jack Nicholson, and Winger's relationship with her husband (Jeff Daniels) and an affair with John Lithgow. It's all very well acted and interesting, but the ending (Winger dies of cancer, and her oldest son is angry at her) was a downer for me. Harrison Ford stars in this thriller involving protecting a young Amish boy targeted, along with Ford, after witnessing a murder in Philadelphia. The plot involves crossing into the Amish culture with understanding and support from  both sides, along with high-level police corruption, and an almost love story. In the ending, Amish peaceful ways win out. I'd always heard that this was an excellent movie. After finally seeing it, I'm unconvinced. The acting is fine, but Newman's role is not appealing. He's basically a jerk from one end to the other, trying to take advantage of his father, lacking concern for other farmers potentially getting hoof and mouth disease infection from his dad's cattle, attacking Patricia Neal, and chasing every woman in town. Didn't appeal that much to me. My review title says it all - actually not that funny, but at least I didn't go to sleep. Involves two sets of parents - one in ritzy New York City, and the other in a small farm town - each gets one child of the other, and they meet at a board meeting in New York in which the future of the small farm town is at stake vs. corporate strip-mining. One set of 'twins' on each side. We get the Ten Commandments, then days in early Rome (I especially like the bit about the Last Supper, particularly the painting scene), then the Spanish Inquisition (not so good), and finally the French Revolution (with Harvey Korman). Sometimes a bit too much slapstick, but very good overall. This truly is a dark thriller, centering around Robert Mitchum as a deranged preacher preying on widows to get at their monies. In between two orphaned children try to escape his clutches while protecting the money entrusted them by their father. Claus von Bulow is convicted of attempting to kill his wife, but has a chance via an appeal. He goes to Alan Dershowitz to handle that effort, who reluctantly agrees. The bulk of the film consists of how, despite sometimes in doubt, Dershowitz et al manage to demolish the State's case. In retrial, Claus is found innocent on all counts. The plot in ""Home Alone"" is clearly improbable, but that doesn't detract one whit from the appeal of impish (but sometimes adult far-beyond his years) Macaulay Culkin, bumbling Joe Pesci, and the rest of the cast.  And, like Aesop's Fables, the film has a moral and a heartwarming tone.  It's just not possible to dislike this film. The final sequel to the original 1972 Godfather film. Michael had somehow originally envisioned legitimatizing the family business (never presented any idea of how that would be accomplished), and ends up having numerous family members murdered, including his brothers, as he struggled to maintain control. Seems that the Sicilian value of family loyalty meant nothing when it came down to money. Goldie Hawn is the lead character in a suspenseful art theft/murder in which her husband turns out to be the villain. The problem with the movie is that it is entirely too predictable, and the end is unbelievable - involving a life-death situation for their child vs. his retrieving the treasure he'd already murdered two others for. Faithfully watched the series when it was originally shown, though missed the early episodes. This volume starts at the very beginning in black and white with the ladies moving into shared space with the men's, who had had everything to themselves for 25 years. Then lots of sexual innuendos, snooty and cheap management - remaining episodes in color. This 1957 English courtroom drama is based on an Agatha Christie story about a man accused of murder. There are so many twists and side-plots that it is impossible to lose interest; viewers will suspect one or two of them en route, but I seriously doubt anyone predicts them all. Really, really, good! Very interesting and clever plot about a very clever, attractive, and ambitious woman - pursued by several men. The plot twists and turns, with various people seeming responsible for her murder (actually, someone else murdered by mistake) - including her. Finally she's rescued at the last moment by a detective originally assigned to investigate her 'murder.' Charlie Chan solves a year-old murder case in two days, wrapping things up at the last minute. Unfortunately his acting is so stilted and the plot so thin that there really isn't much to enjoy. His bumbling #3 Son and bone-head chauffeur don't add much either. Romantic comedy starring Cary Grant and Jeanne Crain involves a physician (Dr. Praetorius - Cary Grant) who teaches in a medical school who also founded a local medical clinic. He's pursued by a professional-misconduct charge brought by another school professor, while getting involved with a distressed young woman (Crain) who falls in love with him. All gets resolved at the end - just in time for Dr. Praetorius to conduct the orchestra. Schwarzenegger, Curtis and Arnold combine to make a movie combining marital suspicious/problems, a crisis involving stolen Russian nuclear warheads, and a ridiculous attempt at a running comedy throughout. The film is mildly interesting at first, but eventually becomes farcical and boring. This best part of this 2014 is the hotel background - very impressive. I'd also like to see the jail depicted in the film. As for the plot and movie, it was far to 'slap-stick' for me, became difficult to follow after awhile (perhaps because I became bored and wasn't paying close enough attention), and too long It's Bond vs. Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion (SPECTRE) again, this time involving a hijacked nuclear bomber with two weapons. The bombs are being used for ransom, but James' intrepid sleuthing and non-stop fighting/killing saves the day. In between more than a few women are seduced - including a few on SPECTRE's side. A good movie, primarily aimed at young girls - with a bit of unrealistic romanticism and a so-called wolf thrown in. The plot, however, was worn out decades ago, if not sooner, and gets far-fetched too often. This film tells of a married  criminology professor's doomed meeting with another woman pictured in a store window painting. He kills a man in self-defense, they dispose of the body in a cover-up effort, then are blackmailed. It is unclear why the killing merits blackmail, especially since the professor should know he's not culpable - probably to avoid his wife learning of the visit. The film is too long, and often drags. It does, however, offer a surprise ending. The team has been out of business for five years - off doing other things. Then Vigo, hidden in a museum portrait, comes into the action, and the Ghostbusters get back together and save the day. The film reportedly has some semblance to the life of William Randolph Hearst, and that is the only aspect of it that creates interest - otherwise it would be totally boring. Unfortunately, viewers have no idea what parts might be modeled after Hearst - other than the fact that Kane is a newspaper magnate and lives in a fabulously opulent Xanadu (Hearst Castle). A nice plot, but lame acting makes it boring - so boring that it becomes impossible not to note that the airplane scene at the end of the movie alternatives between showing daylight and nighttime out the windows, supposedly took about 8 hours outward bound, and 26 minutes inbound, and is about as thrilling as watching paint dry. Nice summary of a great accomplishment - by Lindbergh himself, as well as those at Ryan Aircraft that built the plane, and his backers in St. Louis. How he made it across the Atlantic without advanced instruments is amazing. And managing to do this after a sleepless night prior to takeoff - incredible! Jewish comedy writer Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and WASP singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) have their ups and downs in the slapstick romance that eventually ends up with the two going their separate ways. However, while quite entertaining at first, it eventually wears thin near the end. Movie was boring and pointless. Academy-Award Winner - Wasted Talent Category - Robert De Niro. Overall demeanor was repulsive. If this is how minority people live, or even what they think is entertaining, there's absolutely no question in my mind why their relative arrest records are so high. 'Riding the Rails' was interesting at first, providing a 'revisit' to days of the Great Depression and a sense of what life riding the rails was really like - often cold, hungry, dangerous (other riders, railroad police, falls), and frustrating (jobs were not likely found at the end of the ride). Unfortunately, after awhile, one gets the point and the DVD becomes overly redundant. Was disappointed - I have very good memories of Gene Wilder and watched this again now because of his recent death. Unfortunately, it was too formulaic and simple. Not his best work. And while I remember thinking it was very fun when I first saw it, the film just seemed inappropriate this time, given the obvious evilness of Hitler and the Nazis in Germany. ""Are You Being Served? Volume 9"" is absolutely hilarious as the unforgetable staff at London's Grace Brother's give outrageous situations their special humor with puns, innuendos and double entendres.  This disc had the following episodes:  ""The Junior,"", ""Strong Stuff This Insurance,"" ""The Apartment,"", ""Mrs. Slocombe, Senior Person,"" ""The Hero"" and ""Anything You Can Do.""  Every episode hits your funny bone as the staff carries on in its unique and outrageous ways. It was fun to see the group again, with all their quirky mannerisms. However, the movie plot was disappointingly simplistic, degenerating quickly into a less than funny farce involving a vacation to Spain with bedroom confusion. Supposedly a murder mystery, this film instead is one about conflict between two overgrown egos operating in overlapping jurisdictions, with a cornball love story adding to the conflict. The plot is generally very predictable and sophomoric - not worth watching. Perfect well-animated flick for the youngsters.  Great choice to have a laugh, enjoy the great voice cast and well written story of a sweet panda destined for greatness.  Set in old China it has beautiful artwork as part of the appeal.  The story is great, flows well and the characters are exquisitely funny and bright. This Born Free sequel lacks authenticity (the two leads show a loving relationship, when the opposite is well-known) and credibility (how in the world could the three young cubs shown have survived on their own for as long as they supposedly did?). It's also boring. Boring and confusing (too many factions). Brando talks like he's retarded. Follows Brando's reaching the pinnacle of Mafia leadership, then fall. Almost no information on how the mob made money, or how much. Worst of all, when I finished the disc, I learned that there were two more. In this gripping thriller, Barbara Stanwyck stars as Leona Stevenson, a young, beautiful, rich hypochondriac who rarely gets out of bed.  When she dials a wrong number by mistake, she accidentally overhears two men plotting a murder.  As she tries to trace the source of the call she becomes convinced that her husband (Burt Lancaster) is the one plotting the murder, and that she's the target. Turns out she's right - This is the story of a first-year Harvard Law student, James Hart, and his experience in Professor Kingsfield's demanding contracts class. Complicating matters - Hart learns he's dating the professor's daughter, Lindsay Wagner. He ends up with a 93 on the final exam, an 'A.'  I'm guessing that the point of the movie is that Hart eventually prevailed, and others didn't. So what - happens every year. The year 1918 was certainly a traumatic one for America, given WWI and the flu epidemic. However, I couldn't stand the first fifteen minutes or so of this film and did not finish it. Wade (Nick Nolte) was raised by an alcoholic and abusive father (James Coburn) and ends up accidently killing Coburn after Coburn hits him in the head with a bottle. Nolte's life is just one slow, downward drift, ever and ever lower, and boring all the time. Self-destruction in slow motion. Starts out clever, with Mel Gibson having problems understanding and getting along with women. Then it turns into a too predictable romance with his new/unexpected boss. At that point I wanted out. Nicholson retires from being a detective, but becomes involved in a murder case that's reported during his retirement party. Mother asks him to pledge that he will find the killer. Intuition and dogged determination succeed, but fate intervenes. Ends up losing his new girlfriend and becomes a drunk. The characters in this film are all con artists, and buy conning each other - all day, every day. Enter a nice guy (plays 'Earl), and he's set up to be their next victim. Except it doesn't turn out that way, even though they kept on trying. In the end, everyone turns out to be nice, they stop conning each other, and even find true love. This supposedly romantic comedy film stinks - childish, utterly predictable, and boring. Billy Crystal has more talent in his little finger than I have in my entire body - yet he co-wrote this garbage, and plays the lead role. The rest of the cast hopefully have found much better things to do for the other years in their lives. Fashion designer Allison has a boyfriend whom she plans to marry; in the interim, roommate Hedy becomes concerned that the marriage will force her to move out and undertakes a number of actions to prevent this from happening. Eventually Hedy kills Allison's fiancee and is on the verge of killing Allison as well when one of Allison's customers saves her at the last second. Turns out Hedy was a psycho from long ago. 'Scary Movie' was a bit rude and crude, but also an interesting respite from 'Normal.' I doubt I'll make a habit of watching more of this genre, but still recommend it as a change of pace. There is almost nothing remotely funny or interesting about this movie. The plot centers around a remote town in Australia that is providing a communication link with Apollo 11, the first manned trip to the moon. There's a bit of snarkiness between the American representative and the Australians at the radio telescope site, visits from high ranking Australians and the American Ambassador. Supposedly this is a true story - so what. Not as fast moving or funny as ""Madagascar 2:  Escape to Africa.""  Still, it was enjoyable and entertaining, with excellent animation and the same goofy characters as ""Madagascar 2.""  I could watch ""Madagascar 2"" over and over - but one time is enough for the first movie. Meryl Streep is the key to this movie, grabbing viewers from the first scene.  The story is fun and would appeal to all, especially those who are assistants to demanding bosses.  Many laughs, with good insight to the special pressures on women at the top. This version was undoubtedly shot in a Costco location where, ironically, they closely track and display the productivity of checkout staffers. The plot is a bit stretched beyond credulity at times regarding the degree of employee conniving against management and vice-versa. Nonetheless, the movie is entertaining, good triumphs over evil, and the boy gets the girl (I think). Also easy to understand and hard to ignore, this is a positive eye-opener if one is still sitting on the fence. It also inadvertantly reveals a weakness of Democracy - inability to act until usually too late. Would like to see the material/data updated. A terminally-ill con man and his estranged son cross the U.S. on $5/day - objective is to reach specialized treatment. The plot is old, the acting thin, and their constant conning others becomes quite annoying. This movie is not recommended for anyone. The annual trek over the mountains to exchange salt for grain splits a community between its elderly chief and a rebellious young aspirant. Old customs vs. new thinking supposedly conflict; actually, neither is omniscient. The tale told also has hidden, unexplained inconsistencies. Nonetheless, the film is worth watching for the excellent photography that covers both the scenery and the lives of Tibetans living high in the Himalayans. Movie was boring and pointless. Academy-Award Winner - Wasted Talent Category - Robert De Niro. Overall demeanor was repulsive. If this is how minority people live, or even what they think is entertaining, there's absolutely no question in my mind why their relative arrest records are so high. A dance contest, and a fire drill are the two best episodes in this volume, though I had a fair amount of difficulty understanding some of the British accent. The disc lacks a helpful accompanying written dialogue. More good episodes that I missed when the series originally aired, such as Mr. Grainger almost being given the retirement cuckoo clock after 37 years, Grace Brothers trying to save money by turning off the heat (lots of innovative ways to get around it), a 'Think Tank' episode when the group tries brainstorming to improve sales (and Mr. Rumbold steals their ideas), etc. Captain Peacock gets a key to the Executive Washroom AND an invitation into the Executive Lunch Room, throws his weight around over the time spent on employee breaks, and in another episode everyone is trying to get off on the same day because of illness. All good clean fun! The acting was excellent, and the plot had more than enough depth. However, I couldn't finish the fim. It was just too horrible - heavy on messing with young boys minds, those of its victims, and viewers' as well. I mean this as a complement, I think. Certainly left me wondering about the burdens placed on children in the homes of mentally-limited/deranged parents.  Watch it if you can!

Certainly left me wondering about the burdens placed on children in the homes of mentally-limited/deranged parents.  Watch it if you can! In spite of the insipid repeated singing acts. Every possible sexual innuendo was exploited, as well as a number of others involving passing gas. Lots of high technology, and a major threat threatens the world's future. And at the end good wins out over evil, without the violence of the obviously parodied James Bond movie genre. The film is part coming-of-age and part gang-warfare told from the viewpoint of the children involved. Bullets, guns, lawlessness, and violence are all over. Makes one wonder how at the wisdom of having the Olympics in Brazil. This 1931 is the original Frankenstein movie, worth watching for its 'historical' value. However, it isn't that interesting nor terrifying; worse yet, the sequels are largely repeats of the original with new twists. The Mel Brooks/Gene Wilder remake, with Teri Garr, Cloris Leachmn, Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, and Gene Hackman is much better. I didn't realize this was a 'Bonus Material' disc, with a career review of John Inman, Mollie Sugden, Wendy Richards, and a review of British slang. No actual episodes. Next time I'll be more careful. Baltimore homicide detective Jimmy McNulty gets into hot water and is assigned to a detail of outcasts tasked with investigating drug lord Avon Barksdale and his operation. The plot involves numerous individuals and twists and turns - too many, after awhile. While well written, the degree of incompetence/malevolence at the top becomes unbelievable after awhile, and the length of the series is far too long for my taste.  The really good news - no ads. ""Chef- Season 1""  is a British comedy.  Overall it has the same theme as many of American cooking competitions.  The Chef in charge of incompetent underlings shouts and slams down dishes and pans.  If you like to laugh at striving cooks being humiliated it may appeal to you.  There are some quieter comedy moments, but overall it is just offensive to the senses. ""Borat"" skewers all manner of ""political correctness"" en route to a laugh-ridden look at ourselves - feminists, church-goers, frat boys, those predjudiced against Jews and/or blacks, and politicians provide Candid Camera opportunities for silliness that take advantage of our normal efforts to be polite and tolerant of others from a different background.  Definitely a ""Must See!"" Absolutely hilarious, from start to finish, with stellar performances by all. Mel Brooks and crew (Gene Wilder, Terri Garr, Cloris Leachman, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, and Madeline Kahn) cannot be matched. The film is a parody of the original novel Frankenstein, and uses props created for the original 1931 film. Wasn't very funny at all, and not that much reaction from the audience. Some of the material was sick - eg. making fun of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Alzheimer's. Then dragging around her supposedly deceased dog's fur, and claiming it committed suicide like her husband. Poor taste. It's just not possible to get sick and tired of Wanda Sykes - her material is great (usually non-G rated), well-delivered, and nothing but funny. She starts out with a few lines about her dog, and its all laughs from there til the end. This is a thinly disguised aping of 007, cast in China during the Cultural Revolution. Lots of snide remarks from Gregory Peck to the Chinese and his American superiors, a foolish premise about an agricultural breakthrough that China might not be willing to share, and it just goes on and on. The photography in ""Planet Earth"" is incredible - so clear, bright, and detailed. Their ability to follow animals from above and afar, as well as depict wondrous scenes is beyond belief. My only problem is an aversion to the constant bloody killing scenes. This starts out as a nice story about a single dad with incredible effort and talent who goes from nothing to owning his own brokerage firm in S.F. Will Smith and his young son's performance are excellent, but the plot has been tinkered with to the point that its not believable (too many sudden roadblocks), and becomes overly heart-tearing. I love Chris Rock - his HBO appearances are classic.  However, ""Everyone Likes Chris"" is more than a little watered down from the expectations set by Rock's other appearances.  On the other hand, I should also note that his stories about growing up in Brooklyn and dealing with bullies, negative influences, well-intentioned and decent parents, somewhat manipulative siblings, and the usual issues at school are wholesome, lack any serious racial bent, and are at least mildly amusing. I've always been fascinated by abandoned underground settings, the older, the better.  ""Cities of the Underworld"" is a dream come true, especially the material on Rome and Paris.  Not only does the series get access to these sites, but also knowledgeable guides and excellent lighting.  This really is ""Must See TV!"" ""Ice Road Truckers"" tells the story of drivers crossing treacherous lakes in the dead of winter - risking freezing to death or icy drowning, all the while fighting the extreme cold and its effect on equipment.  It also tells the story of a determined driver and abusive truck-owner (Hugh) who continually outsmarts himself by failing to provide well-maintained equipment for his drivers, blaming them instead for breakdowns, and losing lots of money as a result. I did not realize the special skills required to be a forensic pathologist, over and above that of standard hospital pathologist. Unfortunately, as the DVD pointed out, that has led to major problems investigating notable cases such as President Kennedy's assassination and the murders of Nicole Simpson and her Ron Goodman. The entire DVD was interesting and informative. The film tries to humorous via the use of satire centered around the Iraq War, Dick Cheney, and the role of contractors. However, the connections to reality are so weak and the plot so ridiculous that it ends up being repulsive and boring. This movies features grown men acting like 10-year-olds, and it isn't one bit appealing. At first they hate each other, then they like each other - either way the plot is detestable.  Bottom-Line: There's absolutely nothing appealing about two spoiled forty-year-old men living at home and acting childish. Further, it's an insult to adults today acting like adults and having to live at home because of the bad economy.

Unfortunately his access to medical care is limited in Arizona - hopefully will change soon. Still not certain how to best relate to him, and wish the program had provided more data on how parents can best help adult children with this problem. A homeless man and his duck that follows him around L.A. I honestly don't know what the point of this was, but I can definitely state that it was far too long. This film was probably highly controversial in its day, mocking the life of Jesus. However, since then we've had years of South Park, Blazing Saddles, and other films pushing the edge. The film is not sacrilegious, though nowhere near respectful. And of course, it is light-hearted throughout. This is a science fiction story about a disparate group of people who attempt to contact aliens. The group includes electrical lineman Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), single mother Jillian whose son disappeared while a UFO was in the area, and a French researcher who thinks we can use music to communicate with aliens. They all meet up at Devil's Tower, Wyoming. This performance is boring, even aggravating. It's just not funny, and is way to full of the ""F"" word. Carlin was much funnier previously, especially on TV and the Carson show. Rock starts out talking about the 2008 election (Bush, McCain, and Obama) and ends up on sex. In between its non-stop humor - race, sex, jobs, sex, the differences between men and women, sex, his African safari, etc. He's a fantastic talent. A homeless man and his duck that follows him around L.A. I honestly don't know what the point of this was, but I can definitely state that it was far too long. ""World Water Wars"" has a lot of good information and material - we don't have nearly the available water that one would think, given that most is salt water, polluted, or tied up in glaciers. Was disappointing to see how private enterprise uses water, essential to life, to extort from those who can least afford it. Should have also had material on the increasing feasibility of desalination as a partial solution. Tommy Lee Jones tracks a serial killer preying on young women; at the same time he's also thinking about a 40-year-old killing of a black escapee. Ultimately, the two are traced to the same source.  The movie was interesting at first, but suffers from a few inexplicable 'plotholes,' being overly complex, playing up Jones' non-racist background, and unrealistic levels (for today) of blacks fear of cooperating with police investigations. Somehow Hurricane Katrina gets dragged into the plot as well. Saw Russell Brand on a morning TV show - he was a sensation, so watched this DVD. It was nowhere near his TV performance - mostly full of himself, and hard to understand - given his English accent and the lack of subtitles. Ferrell does an excellent job imitating former President Bush, and doesn't pull any punches doing it. On the other hand, he doesn't beat various issues into the ground. A nice, entertaining summary of 8 not so entertaining years. Excellent clear, and sometimes slow-motion photography. Showed how they sometimes rotate their wings to provide lift on both the forward and return strokes, different styles and lengths of their beaks, their aggressive defense of favorite flower areas, and how they eat bugs to put protein in the diet. Also included interesting information on at-rest and in-flight heart rates, as well as how they conserve energy at night. Teenager Clarisse 'Precious' Jones is obese, illiterate, sexually abused by both parents - including HIV-positive and pregnant for the second time by her father, and living in inner-city poverty. Yet, she somehow rises a bit above the morass with her dreams and determination to do better. Also inspiring are those who work to help her - teachers, a social worker, and a nurse's aide. David Norris (Matt Damon) runs for U.S. Senate, loses, but meets a fascinating ballet dancer. But a group of mysterious men using supernatural powers work to keep them apart. It's just too silly and non-sensical to be taken seriously, or viewed. I enjoyed the Phil Silvers Show when it aired and it's still funny today when viewed years later on these DVDs. However, thinking back on my own experience in the Army, I'm thinking it would have been even funnier if some of the episodes included tricks played by the lower ranks to get out of work, go AWOL, etc. Reality - I never met an Army sergeant like Bilko - too artificial to be believed. ""The Girl Who Kicked the Horne",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
's Nest was somewhat disappointing in that the minutiae of the case gets boring.  The two original leads have very little interaction.  That is what spiked the chemistry in the previous two movies.  Just too much revenge in this story -  and much much talk.  The story can't help dragging because of the complications from her father's murder and intricate details of the infiltration of spies at Sweden's highest level of government. Excellent acting by a broad cast of stars, combined with a light-hearted plot where the bad guy (Alan Alda - a Wall Street swindler who has stolen the retirement funds belonging to employees at his penhouse) gets what he richly deserves in the end. Yes, it's a bit simplistic, but still enjoyable. 'Unknown's' plot involves a series of unlikely deviations from an implausible (overly complex) assassination plot aimed at giving seed companies patent control over a professor's newly developed version of genetically-modified corn. Yet, even within this unlikely/implausible setting, viewers immediately also sense the eventual separation of Neeson from his 'wife,' and joining forces with the female cab driver that saved his life in the beginning scenes. Overall, the film is tolerable, but sometimes irritating because of its implausibility and complexity. The movie is built around three guys having ridiculously horrible bosses - actually horrible to the point of being beyond reality. It's lowbrow comedy at best, one of the worst films of 2011 at worst. Save your time and money - watch or do something else. 'Casino Jack' is a fairly good summary of Abramoff's activities, with one main exception - it didn't make clear what was done that got him into trouble - secretly lobbying against their own clients to force them to pay for lobbying services, illegal gift-giving and campaign donations. I still don't really understand how space/time interact and curve, dark energy, that the world is only two-dimensional, etc. On the other hand, at least I know am somewhat knowledgeable about the latest research doings in the world of physics. And they did a good job of stating things clearly - it's just that I still can't get past my life experience of living in a much simpler, three-dimensional world that seems filled with matter. During the summer of 1956 Colin Clark was just getting into the film business as a 3rd-assistant on the set of 'The Prince and the Showgirl' starring Marilyn Monroe and Sir Laurence Olivier. His diary account of his involvement in that film's making in which we became her close confidant while she was trying to escape work pressures and the company of her Hollywood hangers-on. This is supposedly 24-hours in the 'life' of Lehman Brothers. It fails to explain the investments that got Lehman into trouble, the firm's reaction to the news that it was in trouble is nonsensical, the original scenes are unbelievable, etc., etc. Great plot (including the tension between the 'fast-tracked new inspector vs. his seasoned underlings), excellent acting,and not too long. However, at the very end the pieces seemed to just come out of nowhere, with little connection to the prior activity. Implausible and overly violent; Bruce Willis looks gaunt (cancer?). 'Plot' involves drug-running, revenge for a botched job, a double-cross, and a few people caught in the middle. I'm surprised that such a low-grade movie would involve a high-value actor. French romantic comedy-drama modeled along the lines of a black-and-white silent film set in 1927 - 32 Hollywood. An older silent-film star meets a rising young actress just prior to the introduction of 'talkies.' She transitions and becomes a star, he doesn't, and becomes a broke has-been. Eventually they become a dancing pair - turns out he has a French accent that wouldn't work well in U.S. films. This DVD was interesting and credible, though I sometimes got lost in all the twists and turns. Young  constable Endeavour Morse investigates a case in a nearby town involving a missing girl. Turns out that Morse also has a love of opera, and that turns out to be a key component in the plot. Another component - his infatuation with an unattainable woman. Then there's high-level skullduggery, both at the local police department and one of the Crown's ministers. Colin Farrell plays a struggling writer, unable to progress on his 'Seven Psychopaths.' Woody Harrelson is a psychopathic gangster whose dog was just stolen by Farrell's best friends who use reward money to help pay for cancer treatment of another. We also meet other psychotic killers - eg. one who chops his victims up with a meat cleaver and allows his pet rabbit to drink their blood. Its boring and incredibly gross. It really wasn't that funny, would never and couldn't legally happen in real life, and certainly wasn't a PG family show either. So, truth be told, the time spent watching it was wasted. Aubrey Plaza is a disillusioned college graduate living at home and working as an unpaid magazine intern. She volunteers to investigate a classified ad proposing to go back in time, and becomes one of three sent to do so.  I love Aubrey Plaza in 'Parks and Recreation. However, the 'plot' in this film (love interests for all three) is too thin and the film isn't very  interesting. A 2012 American romantic comedy-drama in which the male lead, Bradley Cooper, has just been released from a psychiatric hospital and moved back in with his parents. Determined to win back his estranged wife, he meets recently-widowed sex addict Jennifer Lawrence, who also has some significant psychological problems. The two work together to achieve both Cooper's and Lawrence's (doing reasonably well in a dance competition) goals. En route, they resolve their psychological problems and end up getting married. Started out good, but almost immediately degenerated into completely unrealistic scenarios involving the stumbling hero trying to make the collar on the wily identity thief - instead of simply bringing in police once he'd located her. From that point onward the plot is ridiculous and boring. Audrey Hepburn plays the role of Holly Golightly - an eccentric society girl who lives off rich men. A new neighbor moves in (George Peppard) - a purported writer (who hasn't written anything in years) living off a wealthy, older married woman (Patricia Neal). Eventually they both shed their supporters and join forces. It's a long movie, but worth the time. This movie is boring and makes Denzel Washington look bad - a flagrant drug, alcohol, and sex abuser, as well as a serial liar. If I was Allstate Insurance I'd stop using him as a spokeperson. Neanderthals preceded humans by about 140,000 years. Then, over 60,000 years ago the first humans entered Europe, still in the Ice Age. So what happened to the Neanderthals? This DVD provides evidence that Neanderthals were more intelligent than previously thought, may have had language capability, and 'disappeared' by virtue of being assimilated into the much larger number of humans via interbreeding. This documentary shows how 120 Earth-observing satellites currently in orbit have revolutionized our understanding of Earth and its weather, etc. systems. Very detailed climate models have been refined, the key role of Antarctica, phosphate from Africa moving to the Amazon, etc. The story centers around a burned-out CIA black ops agent assigned to protect a code operator at a secret broadcasting location. He's tired of being ordered to kill people that are innocent bystanders. Then he's ordered to do so again in its next assignment - boring from start to finish. 'Admission' presents a nice story about a supposedly career-driven assistant admissions director at Princeton who meets a quirky, but brilliant candidate at an unconventional new high-school. She also meets a new love at the school. The only plot drawback was the strange logic that led to her believing she was the mother of that candidate and then over-stepping her bounds to sneak him into Princeton. Ben Stiller directed and starred in this film, a movie of James Thurber's story of a day-dreamer who escaped his ordinary life by disappearing into a world of fantasies filled with heroism, romance and action. Unfortunately, it is incredibly boring, has almost no resemblance to Thurber's original story, and makes little real-life sense. This 2013 WWII German war drama is about a young girl living with her adoptive Germany family during the Nazi era. Taught to read by her kind-hearted foster father, she begins borrowing books from a collection maintained by the wife of the local mayor who is hard-core Nazi. Narration is provided by a voice representing Death.  Excellent acting and compelling plot. Very slow-moving story about a mother trying, after 50 years, to learn about the son she gave away for adoption. Assisting her in this is journalist Martin Sixsmith - who recently lost his government job. They do learn that the children were mostly sold to Americans for 1,000 pounds, each.  Way too slow, incredibly boring The vast majority of this video consisted of vapid praise for the fictional Sherlock Holmes. Reality - his 'career' consisted of fortuitous discoveries and unscientific inferences, all achieved without an essential structured approach. It was interesting to get a bit of a glimpse inside Google, as well as verification of some of their hiring practices that I'd read about elsewhere. However, the movie was far too long, predictable, and boring. 'Secrets of the Tower of London' presented viewers with the origin of this London landmark, along with its history up to today. I especially appreciated the opportunity to learn about the lives of those who now 'guard' and take care of it, along with views of areas not open to the general public. The show is mostly boring, centered around Julia Louis-Dreyfus finding herself caught between a divorced new boyfriend and his ex. The film tries to add excitement via a background narration of what is happening, but that's simply irritating. I watched this in its entirety, but three days later am basically unable to remember much about it - except that it was silly, and revolved around father-daughter conflict and supposed sexism in the voiceover industry. This is definitely something one doesn't want to watch. The movie was generally interesting, but also too long, and highly improbable. It had 'entrapment' written all over it in 24 pt. headline type. Supposedly it provided coverage of a scandal in New Jersey - some people in Arizona think it covers a political scandal involving the legislature in the late 1970s. However, there is no resemblance to that scenario whatsoever. My guess is that the film was about 15% true, and the rest was a wild fabrication. Was there a plot to this film - if so, I couldn't follow it. AI is a potentially far more interesting topic than depicted in this film, with much more serious problems. (In, fact, I don't really understand what the 'problem' was in the film that created a negative reaction to a computer taking on someone's persona.  Bottom-Line: How do you spell 'boring,' terrible,' and 'pointless?' T R A N S C E N D E N C E Starts out as a fun story - guy loses girl because he lacks courage, and eventually wins a much better girl by underhandedly defeating her criminal gunslinger husband. Does drag along after awhile, and the gags sometimes become overdone. Overall, however, better than watching most TV shows. Woody Allen's dermatologist confides in him that she'd like to try a three-some, so Woody talks his employee into becoming a gigolo. The employee is 50+, and no George Clooney. Somehow the movie ends - but not before boring viewers to death. Eventually his 'gigolo' retires after finding true love. The only thing good about this movie is Liam Neeson, and even isn't able to fix it. There are just to many inconsistencies and unlikely actions - including rapid identification of the perps in a cold case, along with a confusing plot and sloppy photography, to be believable. 'Learning to Drive' is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a sharp-tongued author whose husband just left her, and her driving teacher, a gentle Indian Sikh with an impending arranged marriage. The plot is about as obvious and thin as it could possibly be - I referred to Google just to make certain. Absent any mystery, comedy, or any other possible source of interest, I spared myself the torture of watching this and turned it off. Cathedrals, with their immense size and intricate detail, are amazing - especially when one considers they were constructed about 800 years ago, w/o tools, little/no paper, and requiring decades to complete - thanks to funding problems, seasonal delays, slow-curing mortar, and simply the enormity of the task. This DVD helped bring that process to life. Goes back to the earliest days with Ed McMahon as Carson's sidekick, and provides a series of short snips out of numerous shows. Mishaps with animals brought onto the show, 'oddball' ordinary citizens," famous names - it's all prime-time material. Labeling vigilantes' use of a windmill as a hanging platform as """"technology"""" is a real stretch. Similarly", ear cropping and branding to clearly ID robbers, use of a bullwhip to punish others, and a mountain howitzer to blow down a wanted man's cabin. Sorry - there really isn't any technology involved here - just raw justice," and sometimes abuse of justice. """"The Rockefellers""""  is well researched documentary of a family with power going beyond money alone.  It is over three hours long", and could have been done in less than two hours to get the main points and still hold interest.  Overall it shows the shady beginnings and the family's ultimate mission of public service. A 1934 Oscar-winning film starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. (They also won Oscars in this film.) In the film, she's recently married a pilot (unique in those days) but her father wants to have it annulled and 'traps' her on his yacht. She, however, jumps overboard and escapes, meets Clark on a bus to NYC, and despite their initial dislike of each other, end up getting married. We've all seen numerous short clips of the meteor that recently exploded over Russia. It was interesting to learn scientists' best estimates of its size and speed, as well as the results of analyses of its composition. But that should only have taken 20 minutes - TOPS! Program begins with detailed and lucid coverage of the use of prime numbers for encoding data sent across the Internet. It then went on to quantum computing, paranoid cryptography and other complex methods currently being developed and on the frontiers of science. The 'bad news' is that most of the latter material was beyond my comprehension," though it least familiarized me with the terminology and general ideas.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AFLQGO7CJVK50," Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda, and more star in what is considered to be the best biker movie ever made. People still talk about this when talking about biker culture. Classic Sons of Anarchy(FX television series) for classic movie fans! One of my favorite dramas ever made. Do not let the young cast of stars fool you, this is premium acting at it's finest. Teenage angst and anger meet with outstanding acting. Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and many, many more stars appear in this masterpiece. If you like your drama 80's style with some of the best performances I have ever seen in a drama, THIS IS IT! Highest possible recommendation! Stars galore in this tribute to when the women were wild, the wardrobe was ghastly, but the parties never ended. Serious drug abuse in this movie but that is the comedy aspect of it. Young people partying anywhere from in the forest to on the football field! This is a cult classic and is quoted to this day in some sketches(Dave Chapelle) and monologues. Stoner comedy is how to best describe it. Rambo in outer space is how to best describe this film. Newer versions of genetically altered soldiers are replacing the older ones. This film is action packed with an incredibly large scope. Large land vehicles like giant tanks are used in warfare. The homeless try to survive in this wasteland. What happens next turns out to be all out war between the old and the new. A cult classic from the 80's that is shockingly scary for that time period when horror movies were so blasted cheesy. A female Satanist conjures up a seriously big, nearly unstoppable demon named Pumpkinhead and it goes on a killing spree! A ""revenge demon"" in that it gets vengeance for someone who feels that they have been wronged. VERY violent movie with shocks galore! Although not as good as part 2, this originated the Warlock series of movies. Special effects and color are not nearly as good as parts 2&3 but it is worth buying to complete the collection. Part 2(Armageddon) is OUTSTANDING and a must-have for occult/horror/fantasy fans. Duel is a classic movie about a car driver terrorized by a semi rig in the Arizona desert. KITT vs. Goliath on Knight Rider is similar. The Car is another similar movie. A car being chased by a semi rig that looks ""evil"" is what this movie is about. Watching this may make you think twice before angering a semi driver! It is made by someone named Steven Spielberg, you know, E. freakin' T.! If you like the modern vampire/werewolf ""stuff"", you should like this movie. However, there is one major difference; these lycanthropes are were-panthers. People that turn into black panthers when in the heat of passion. If you like a good werewolf movie, you will probably like this but remember, they are werecats, not wolves. Warriors is the original Judgment Night. It is part gangster, part thriller type of movie. Intense, violent, ""edge of your seat"" is an understatement. Human survival in the concrete jungle and nobody depicts it better. One of my favorite movies, along with Judgment Night starring Emilio Estevez and Cuba Gooding Jr., ever made regardless of genre/category. If it wasn't for Flashdance, there probably would've never been a Dirty Dancing movie. This was out in theaters WAY before Patrick Swayze became famous for his role. Jennifer Beals is ssssmokin' HOT in this movie both on and off the stage. If you like your dancing hot and sexy, this is one of the original movies to show you just that. If you like The Excorcist, you will love this movie. It is very similar but also just as graphic and even more graphic in one bad way. PREPARE TO BE SHOCKED. People, events like in this movie DO happen, although very rarely, and have now been proven by men of science to be the unholy truth. This just might be a survival manual, just like The Excorcist, as well as a movie. You have been warned. One of the best zombie apocalypse movies ever made. People in a military bunker underground survive while on the surface, zombies run the show. Gruesome action in the likes of The Walking Dead. It's not all horror though; some of it is action or adventure which is why I would call it ""survival horror"" just like The Walking Dead but with a more U.S. military twist. Action, blood, gore, and horror all combined into one seriously good classic! Smokey& The Bandit for modern women. Where's Burt Reynolds on this movie? He belongs on it! Excellent script, storyline with a shocking ending that you will never see coming and will pull your heartstrings. Although aimed more at a female audience, if you like Convoy or Smokey & The Bandit- like movies, this is a must-have! Geena Davis is HOT in this as well with a steamy sex scene. Get it! Snipes and Harrelson star with a ssssssmoookiiin' hot Rosie Perez in this basketball/gangsta'/comedy movie about real life in the ghetto. Steamy sex scenes between Woody and Rosie. Basketball scenes that show skill on the actors parts. Hustle for the paper in basketball or get smoked. Unless your Rosie threatens to leave you if you do. Drama, comedy, and real life combine for a good combination. Oh, did I forget to mention that Rosie Perez is HOT in this movie? In my estimation, the funniest clean comedian ever and this is his best tape ever! One of the most quoted comedy albums ever made! There is only one rough spot but that is at the very end and it lasts only about 30 seconds. Nothing obscene but it might offend some Christians. He talks comedically about parents cussing out their kids. Seriously though, Bill Cosby is the best family friendly comedian I have ever heard! Ice-T and a ton of other stars are in this Rambo-like movie. A homeless man is recruited to hunt with a group of C.I.A. agents but finds out he is the hunted! Little do the poor saps know that this homeless man, played by Ice-T, is also a former elite special forces Marine! One man versus a group of rogue agents in the woods. If you like Rambo, you will like Surviving the Game. The original superhero movie of modern times. Spider- Man had one in the 70's but was a joke, period. Superman I is still one of the better superhero movies ever made although with Iron Man released, is no longer the best. Some would say Batman was better as well. Worth buying if you ask me. Richard Pryor paved the way for modern comedians like Eddie Griffin, Eddie Murphy, Chris Tucker, and Katt Williams. This is the original King of Comedy that was not afraid to tick off the censors! If you like modern comedians like Kevin Hart or Eddie Griffin, Richard Pryor is one of the originals. If you like your comedy clean this is NOT for you. Once again, Richard Pryor paved the way for modern, raunchy humor. 'Nuff. Jason, the ultimate psycho, is allegedly dead after being killed by the FBI. Technically true but yet not true. WHAT comes back to Earth is even more dangerous! Now Jason can possess people the same way demons do! In this shockingly violent horror flick we learn the true secret of why Jason is such a psycho and now a demoniac as well. One of the best horror movie endings of all time with a big surprise guest! This is White Men Can't Jump with a SERIOUS gangsta' twist. 2Pac and others star on this with a soundtrack that is still known to this day. ""Regulators"" by Warren G is one of my favorite rap songs EVER. Basketball for paper and tournaments with thug life is what this is about. If you liked White Men Can't Jump but wanted more violence, here you go. Rocky is loved by sports fans and drama fans everywhere. Boxing movies aspire to be Rocky regardless of who makes it. They need to make movies like these much more often. Highly recommended! If you like War of the Worlds(any version), this is basically a remake of that very movie but much better. This movie has excellent effects, graphics, etc. with an all-star cast to make a high-grossing box office monster that is in the record books. Highly recommended! My favorite Elvis movie ever made. Funny with cuties galore! A movie my family has watched together for decades now! I would rate it PG. Safe for kids 7& up. Adults like it because, well ,do I have to say it?! It's Elvis! The girls are hot! What more do you want?! Despite the obvious druggie humor in some episodes, this is still family entertainment for households who do not mind viewing classic comedy. The Monkees were a very popular pop/rock band as well. Tame by todays standards but still funny. What Smokey&the Bandit was/is to cars this is to semi rigs. Truckers fighting cops and forming long lines of big rigs called ""convoys"" is what this movie is about. Trucker culture PERSONIFIED. Highly recommended. The movie is most similar to Ark II, but with more adult themes(no porn or anything like that but still more aimed at an older audience). Good action with an ""Airwolf"" and an ""A-Team"" cast which is sure to excite. If you like post-apocalyptic science fiction, this is for you. The second in the legendary Star Wars series.  The Dark Side gains in strength and Yoda can feel it. He notices strange feelings in Anakin Skywalker. But hey, I cannot give away TOO much. If you saw it and liked it, this movie is well worth buying and will be worth money for decades. Some of the best sci-fi ever made. 'Nuff said. Pick a Houston hit, it is on this collection. Videos, not just audios. Too many hits to list here. Pick one and I guarantee you you will find it on this DVD. Well worth the price! Steve Austin had metal in him way before Arnold did(Terminator). Super speed, super strength, super leaping ability. One of the best 1970's television series. If you like superheroes but live action, this is very high quality for a 70's program. Must have! Classic comedy that stands the test of time. In the tradition of The Three Stooges and Laurel&Hardy, this is another ""slapstick"" style piece of comedy history that will never die but with children as the stars. Although clearly outdated, if you like the 3 Stooges(check them out on AMC in the early morning hours), you will like Our Gang/Little Rascals. Nuff' said! Blade fights super-vampires in this one. This one is especially bloody and gruesome. Like the others, martial arts meets the occult in an all-out war. Ron Perlman(Hellboy,Sons of Anarchy,etc.) stars in this one as  as a bad guy. Easily as good as the other Blade movies. Highly recommended! The best in the Lord of the Rings series. I watched the animated version back in the day and the live version is just as good, even better. If you like ancient warfare mixed with mythical creatures and magic duels, this is one of the best movies ever made. Highly recommended! The best of the Star Trek movies. More action than the others other than part 2. As in The Wrath of Khan, this part is all about WAR. Romulans develop a supership capable of fighting a dozen Federation ships at the same time. You get the idea. This is a must have for sci-fi fans, even ones who think Star Trek is boring. This changes all of that, A LOT. My favorite of the Terminator movies. The female terminator is HOT in this movie and I don't mean her microchips. Easily the best effects of all 4 movies. Worth more than you are probably paying for it. Blisteringly funny is best how to describe this DVD. Richard Pryor calls Griffin ""the funniest man alive"". Griffin brings it in this hilarious and raunchy gem! The laughs do not stop as Eddie talks about his old 'hood. Most comedians get their inspiration from real life events and this is no exception. Remember Bill Cosby's ""Himself"" album? Imagine that but MUCH more harsh language and I mean HARSH. Taxi is another movie for the 2fast2Furious crowd. A bumbling cop teams with a taxi driver who has sport-tuned her taxi into a BMW-killing machine! If you like Fast&Furious, Smokey and the Bandit, or any car chase movie, this is one to certainly add to your collection! Comedy times ten is how to describe this masterpiece! One of my favorite comedies of all time! I rank this right up there with MASH, Taxi, Night Court, Cosby Show, Welcome Back Kotter, How I Met Your Mother, and Anger Management. Laugh out loud HILARIOUS! Tokyo Drift, although very good, lacks the overall feel of the other Fast&Furious movies. Part 4 is the best with parts one, then two, being second and third. Tokyo Drift is an excellent movie but just not as good as the others. I still would buy it though. Clearly, I already did. Although this is clearly a Godzilla rip-off, do not let that fool you or scare you away from this movie. IT IS VERY GOOD. Excellent special effects, excellent creature effects, excellent camera work both professional and also in the tradition of The Blair Witch style. Highly recommended! This is proof that not all things from Russia are dull or boring or poor quality. If you like Underworld or Blade, YOU ARE REALLY GONNA' LOVE THIS! I don't want to spoil ANYTHING so all I am saying is GET THIS MOVIE. It makes American vampire/werewolf movies look bad in comparison! UNBELIEVABLY GOOD MOVIE. The best werewolf movie ever made. None of the sequels compare or even come close. This is THE item for werewolf movie fans everywhere. I would pay double what I did if necessary to buy it. Award winning transformation special effects that are still competitive in 2017. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! THE shortest lived Doctor ever but still one of the best in special effects and storyline. This Doctor only lasted for this movie but you will not be disappointed. Action packed and slightly more violent than other Doctors you may be accustomed to seeing. He actually gets into a minor streetfight! New Years Eve is deadly when ""we are not alone!"" A nightmare come true for horror fans! A family inherits a very eccentric hopusev made of glass and gears. Special effects galore with multiple ghosts of all descriptions(most very bad). The house turns out to be an occult battery designed for a horrific purpose. Multiple attacks and some murders take place in the occult thriller! Some places you should not enter even when the welcome mat is placed out for you. If you like Anaconda, you will possibly like this movie. Although the cast is not quite as star-studded, Dean Cain is certainly no slouch in the acting department. Special effects are good but not Star Wars good. This movie I feel is underrated and deserves a look-see by far more people. Soto is gorgeous in all her movies and does not fail to please in that aspect in this one as well. Very predictable movies but people who are a fan of these types of movies(Underworld, Bloodrayne, etc.) will like these movies. Action packed with lots of sexy vampiress scenes to please the inner fanboy in all of us! 'Nuff said! THIS IS THE FUNNIEST COMEDIAN I HAVE EVER SEEN! His sketches on ""Samuel Jackson Beer"" and many others are already legendary! SHAME ON YOU if you have never seen this comedian in action! Combine Eddie Griffin with Richard Pryor and you pretty much have it. Borderline obscene with fresh material that will leave you half-baked from laughter! Seriously, I have never seen material this funny. If you like Kevin Hart or Eddie Griffin, you will love this! Duncan faces new opponents and maintains old friends in this outstanding series. Duncan outlasts Connor(Christopher Lambert) who is killed(wait until you see who kills him; YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE IT!!!) to stay alive.  If you like the movies you will love the series! Highest possible recommendation! Freaky more than scary but still worth the watching. People are killing themselves for apparently no reason. Strange behavior on people's parts everywhere. This reminds me a little of a 70's movie called The Crazies. No gore or occult frights but definitely a scary movie. Connor's brother is in his final season on this one. Duncan faces new opponents and maintains old friends in this outstanding series. Duncan outlasts Connor(Christopher Lambert) who is killed(wait until you see who kills him; YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE IT!!!) to stay alive. If you like the movies you will love the series! Highest possible recommendation! A remake of the first Howling movie. Pretty good, too. The female werewolf was HOT and we got to see that in one certain scene. Although not as good as the first, this is probably the second best of the 7-part series. Part 6&7 are WORTHLESS. Part 6 does show vampire vs. werewolf way before Underworld was released, however. Stand-up comedy has never been this controversial. One of the funniest men in history! This features his insightful, unique, hilarious, and sometimes raunchy views on social, political, and celebrity issues. It is my own personal opinion that with the possible exceptions of Eddie Griffin or Kat Williams, Chris Rock is the funniest comedian of the past thirty years. If you like the comedy of Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Griffin, or Chris Tucker, you will love this! Special effects matching Underworld or Twilight easily. Hugh Jackman(Wolverine on X-Men) and Kate Beckinsale(Death Dealer on Underworld) star in this excellent vampire/werewolf, even vampire vs. werewolf movie. Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein's Monster are on this too. Easily a match for other movies in this genre. Highly recommended! A terminator from/on the X-Files?! What is the F.B.I. thinking?! All jokes aside, this movie is easily better than the first one by far. Excellent graphics and effects are what REALLY sells this movie. Linda Hamilton is B-UFFED in it as well. Sci-fi at it's finest! One of the most popular sci-fi movies ever made. This and Predator made Arnold the movie star he was and probably got him into politics as well. Multiple sequels guarantee this will be bought for years to come. Vampire movies are hot these days and this is no exception. It even has pro-wrestling star Triple HHH as a bad guy on it. Martial arts meets Dracula in this final battle between Blade and vampires. Ryan Reynolds is funny as usual but is also buffed and tough in this movie. Jennifer Biel is hot and Karate crazy in this movie. The best of the Blade movie series. Highly recommended! If you like Aliens with Sigourney Weaver, you might like this. Creatures that just love to attack humans are cropping up a lot and it is up to a few bad boys to take them to heck and back. VERY similar storyline to Aliens or Predators. Excellent effects, sets, and backgrounds. Don't underestimate this movie! Tom Cruise stars as a lone security agent on a post-apocalyptic Earth.  A spaceship crashes and he rescues one lone woman from it. He soon learns that his superiors are possibly lying to him about humanity in general. Morgan Freeman also stars in this visual spectacle with some of the best special effects ever made. Seriously, I have not seen this good since Star Wars. Steve Austin had metal in him way before Arnold did(Terminator). Super speed, super strength, super leaping ability. One of the best 1970's television series. If you like superheroes but live action, this is very high quality for a 70's program. Must have! THE BEST SUPERHERO CARTOON EVER MADE. Pick a DC star and chances are they are included. Action and scripts that far surpass anything DC has ever done in the past. A little more riske' and edgy than the Superfriends you remember. This and Unlimited make anything animated from Marvel look like waste in comparison and I like Marvel! If you are or have ever been a comic book fan, this is a MUST! My favorite of the Terminator movies. The female terminator is HOT in this movie and I don't mean her microchips. Easily the best effects of all 4 movies. Worth more than you are probably paying for it. This and Airwolf are the two best movies/TV shows featuring super-vehicles ever. Knight Rider, Blue Thunder; NOT EVEN CLOSE! If you like Airwolf, Firefox originated the concept. Airwolf is a helicopter but Firefox is a jet. If you like either one, you will like the other. Filmation proved with this animated cartoon that they are not limited to live action(Space Academy,Jason,the outstanding Ark II) when it comes to Saturday morning EXCELLENCE. Possibly my favorite animated cartoon series ever. Blackstar was He-Man without the ridiculous characters(Ram Man,Man-eFaces,etc.) on Masters of the Universe. Blackstar was action personified without stupid dialogue and stupid vehicles or characters( I hate He-Man;can you tell!?). An early teen would enjoy this these days despite it being from the 80's. If you don't catch the title, shame on you and I'm not telling! This is DC's claim to fame for decades now! THE BEST SUPERHERO CARTOON EVER. EEEVVVERRRRR! Too many DC stars to name! The Avengers and X-Men ain't got nothin'! The Omen is a Bible-based horror movie about the rise of Satan in human form in the end of days. 1-3 are pretty accurate according to ancient beliefs but part 4 is pretty much made up with little backup(Antichrist does ""increase his number""). Like the Excorcist, it shows Bible beliefs about Satan and his plans for world domination whether possession(Excorcist), or physical form(Omen series). Test your faith and courage. One of the very few cartoons worth viewing in the 80's(Thundar,Blackstar,Thundercats,etc.). Eight is Enough stars do most of the voices in this animated series. Made by a well-known company that you will easily recognize. Good animation without stupid vehicles or He-Man like ridiculousness. Highly recommended. THE BEST SUPERHERO CARTOON EVER MADE. If you have ever bought a single comic or watched a cartoon, shame on you if you don't buy this! Pick a DC star and chances are they make an appearance. Nothing comes close. One of ""the eight films to die for"" series that feature films considered too scary for theaters. Recently widowed Karen Tunny and her 2 girls move into the hills she inherited from her family. However, she does not know that the building is located near an abandoned mine site where a tragedy involving multiple kids' deaths took place about 100 years ago. DreadCentral.com says this is ""a fun undead romp"". If you like the movie Daybreakers, you will like this. Very similar storyline in that vampires are a part of society in a never before seen way. However, you guessed it, they soon start fighting humans all over again. Excellent movie with good effects, graphics, and plenty of action. You will not be disappointed! Stone Cold Steve Austin stars in this action movie where he plays the role of Jack Conrad, a prisoner in a crooked jail who is bought like a slave by a crooked TV producer to participate, against his will, in an illegal and deadly game show taking place on a remote island where nine prisoners are forced to fight to the death while being televised/streamed live online. Action galore! This movie is rated R for violence and language. Enjoy! Godzilla meets Buddhist mysticism in this movie. If you like Godzilla movies, this is a shockingly good movie(Godzilla does not appear in it) and is most similar to the giant Japanese monster movies. Very good effects, graphics and animation with excellent acting make this a surprisingly good action/monster movie. Seth McFarlane is proven again to be the comic genius that he is when he combined Star Wars with Family Guy in an animated spoof of the famous sci-fi movies. Laugh out loud funny with quite good animation(no CGI) is how to describe this DVD. One example:Stewie plays Darth Vader. You get the idea. Outright hilarious! Richard Moll(Bull on Night Court, guest star on Highlander:the series) stars in this slight variation of the classic tale. This takes place in a southern town, not in the upper east coast area. It is the same thing but in this case, the townspeople know a LOT more than they let on. Race With The Devil combined with the classic Headless Horseman  with a southern U.S.A. twist. The Justice League will never die! From the Superfriends to Smallville, from Lois&Clark to Justice League Unlimited, this is the gold standard cartoon by which even some live action shows are measured. The best superhero team of all time! Highest possible recommendation! Surprisingly well made despite never even being heard of by me or my sci-fi friends. There is no actual werewolf or wolfman in it but it is more like a combination of Dark Angel with Jessica Alba and any werewolf movie. Genetic experimentation gone wrong(or very right?). It is better than I expected and is worth watching. Recommended! Shortlived but with excellent quality is how to describe this TV series. A female cop is endowed with the Witchblade, an occult object with enormous power. All sorts of strange attacks and occult happenings occur  as the TV series moves on. Very strange show but with lots of action and scary stuff. Very good TV series! If you like ""Push"" or the ""X-Men"" you will like this. Super-powered people who are being hunted down like witches because apparently they are all evil. A young man that can teleport just like Nightcrawler from the X-Men(maybe a lot further distance though) must fight for his life against a fanatical hunter bent on killing all people with special powers. VERY exciting and action packed! Superheros versus bad guys. 'Nuff said. Excelsior! Godzilla meets Buddhist mysticism in this movie. If you like Godzilla movies, this is a shockingly good movie(Godzilla does not appear in it) and is most similar to the giant Japanese monster movies. Very good effects, graphics and animation with excellent acting make this a surprisingly good action/monster movie. Seth McFarlane is proven again to be the comic genius that he is when he combined Star Wars with Family Guy in an animated spoof of the famous sci-fi movies. Laugh out loud funny with quite good animation(no CGI) is how to describe this DVD. One example:Stewie plays Darth Vader. You get the idea. Outright hilarious!

From the Superfriends to Smallville, from Lois&Clark to Justice League Unlimited, this is the gold standard cartoon by which even some live action shows are measured. The best superhero team of all time! Highest possible recommendation! Surprisingly well made despite never even being heard of by me or my sci-fi friends. There is no actual werewolf or wolfman in it but it is more like a combination of Dark Angel with Jessica Alba and any werewolf movie. Genetic experimentation gone wrong(or very right?). It is better than I expected and is worth watching. Recommended! Shortlived but with excellent quality is how to describe this TV series. A female cop is endowed with the Witchblade, an occult object with enormous power. All sorts of strange attacks and occult happenings occur  as the TV series moves on. Very strange show but with lots of action and scary stuff. Very good TV series! If you like ""Push"" or the ""X-Men"" you will like this. Super-powered people who are being hunted down like witches because apparently they are all evil. A young man that can teleport just like Nightcrawler from the X-Men(maybe a lot further distance though) must fight for his life against a fanatical hunter bent on killing all people with special powers. VERY exciting and action packed! Superheros versus bad guys. 'Nuff said. Excelsior! The second part to the movie that started it all. The Lost Boys originated the vampire/werewolf craze still seen today(Underworld,Twilight,etc.) and the second part carries it on. Corey Feldman stars and also comes with a brief appearance by Corey Haim in this part. CULT CLASSIC. Highly recommended! Ice Cube stars in some of the funniest movies I have ever seen, the Friday series. I mean these movies will genuinely make you laugh out loud and HARD. Chris Tucker and Tiny Lister are guest stars with many more. Some of the funniest comedy ever. I MEAN IT. A blast from the past is an understatement! This collection has the Pinky Tuscadero episodes as well, the ones I really wanted! This show is still funny after all these years. The color is a little outdated but that is about the only negative. A must have for Happy days fans! This is clearly a precursor to The Sarah Conner Chronicles where people are Terminators and do not know it or are Terminators, know it, but still have emotions and old thoughts along with actual hearts and lungs, brains as well. Summer Glau does not star in this movie, however. T4 is as good or better than any of the other T movies and is action packed. Buy it if you have to mow lawns for pay! Some of Chuck Norris' more recent movies are included in this collection. It is much more like Walker,Texas Ranger but with a little Alias and Le Femme Nikita mixed in. Martial arts with modern weapons and spy warfare with covert anti-terrorism to boot. James Bond with a blackbelt teams with the CIA would be a good description although there is no far-fetched gadgets or bed scenes. Excelsior! Camelot's finest wizard and one of the mightiest warlocks in history in his youth is what the name of the show clearly states that this show is about. It sticks with the classic tale about Camelot, Arthur, Modred, Morgana, and the Round Table. Excellent effects and action packed storylines. One of the best fantasy TV series ever made. If you like the sword and sorcery style movies, you will like this. One of the funniest shows of all time. Dan Fielding is what made this show. Constant passes at an unresponsive colleague with strong sexual content is the main seller of this extremely funny comedy. Nothing obscene but not for kids. I will never get tired of watching this series. One of the funniest EVER. The best of the Fast&Furious movies. Vin Diesel meets Crockett&Tubbs describes this perfectly. This sequel is more like Bad Boys than a racing movie. Upper level crime meets street rods. Nuff' said. I watched the original from about 30 years ago and liked it but this new remake of it adds one more thing: LOTS of sex appeal! Shue never lets us down in that category. Do not think this is for intellectual people; IT'S NOT. Put your thinking cap away and just enjoy the carnage and all the hot girls! Genetic engineers are out to create the perfect being but they soon find out that they are not perfect themselves so how can they? Curiosity can kill you and in this case, it nearly does. This is a science fiction/horror movie that deals with the touchy subject of genetic ""tinkering"". Our best experiments sometimes go very, very wrong. Ask Dr. Frankenstein about it. A very different concept that really, really works. Imagine what would happen if War of the Worlds took place in the U.S.A., but in the Old West. Six shooters versus spaceships usually won't work but in this case, we do get a little help from a wristband that is most similar to a Space Ghost type weapon(remember him?). I saw a similar movie on SciFi Channel that was pretty good but not as good as this. Highly recommended! Nonstop thrills in a fast paced thriller. A runaway train full of toxic substances is out of control in Pennsylvania. A veteran engineer and a young conductor are hired to stop the train and avert a toxic chemical disaster! Denzel Washungton and Chris Pine star in this thriller that will satisfy the adrenaline junkie in all of us! This is a true story that delivers unstoppable suspense and excitement! If you like Smokey and the Bandit, you will love Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry. It is one and the same thing but better. Race with the Devil is about campers that accidentally stumble onto a Satanic ritual involving a murder. The movie keeps you guessing as to who is a Satanist in the plot and who is not. It eventually leads to a big car chase with a SHOCK ENDING. Just when you think you are safe.... If you like Blade, you will like this. A vampire/human hybrid but in this case, a female, gets into all sorts of trouble with Nazis. The resulting bloodfeud is violence to the core! If you like the martial arts or vampire style movies, you should like this. It is not as good as the first one with Lokken as the star but is still good for true fantasy fans. One of my favorite cartoons as a child. I always would play Zok the Dragon when at play with other kids in my 'hood. Although not as good as newer cartoons like Thundercats or Blackstar, or even more modern like Young Justice and Justice League Unlimited, this was the shiznet back in the day. Blast from the past! Not as violent as most westerns but with a little comedy thrown in as well. People living in the 1800's in the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S.A. and their everyday live",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 are shown in this good TV series. Wholesome family entertainment. Maybe a little boring for kids but you know they are not watching anything above their rating. Classic family entertainment! Bigfoot has a baby with an alligator(not actually what happens; just a physical description of the monster) and out pops Lockjaw, a seriously bad mutant with a taste for human flesh. This movie is very gory and scary and some parts of it are surprisingly good. Sid Haig(The Devil's Rejects) is easily recognizable. This is not high budget but they did do a good job with what they were given. This is more of the classic style werewolf movie when people are in the forest at night and get attacked repeatedly by a monster resembling a large wolf. However, the main plot twist is," WHO IS IT? Combine a classic """"whodunit"""" with classic werewolf movie and you get the idea. If James Bond was American", his name would be Jack Reacher. This is a spy thriller that is clearly out to match the appeal of Britain's popular MI agent who was/is based on an actual spy from England. If you like action in the Nikita, Le Femme Nikita, or Alias genre," you will love this Movie! Classic horror that does not rely on modern special effects and CGI to scare you. Although laughable by modern standards the sets and backgrounds are not really that bad and downright creepy. These are the classic vampire and Frankenstein mopvies that paved the way for Twilight and Underworld. For a """"blast from the past""""", this will certainly do the job. The Reach, an alien race now on Earth, led by The Ambassador and guarded by Blue Beetle, continues to brainwash the world while siding with a secret society called The Light. Robin, Impulse, and Blue Beetle investigate Lexcorp on ties with The Reach. What they find are double crosses, double agents, and double trouble! This is the series finale that will change the way you think about DC Comics forever! Day of the Animals but hundreds of years later when humans have left Earth. When two people return," they find a paradise but with one catch: the animals are now all gigantic and have """"adapted to kill humans"""". Mix Tarzan", Day of the Animals, and a little bit of King Kong and you pretty much have it but with OUTSTANDING GRAPHICS AND EFFECTS. Pulp Fiction in the U.S. south is how to describe this movie. This includes 3 stories all connected by articles from a southern pawn shop. A man looking for his wife, 2 KKK drug dealers, and an Elvis wannabe' along with many more wacky characters are featured in this combo of action and comedy. Many easily recognized stars are in this movie and it is sure to please fans of this genre. THIS is the Superman that fans have been waiting for! When he fought Doomsday, Supes had to get downright MEDIEVAL on that thing and that is probably where they got the idea for his new attitude in this one. Superman vs. Zod, just like in Superman 2, but one MAJOR difference: KENT GETS KRAAAAZY ON THAT ZOD! In Supes 2, Superman wins but shows mercy. In Man of Steel, Zod is not, well, shall I say, quite so lucky. This ain't your daddy's Superfriends, fan boy! This is the newer, much tougher version of the legendary super team that has true comic book fans buzzing around the world! This is rated PG-13 for a BIG reason. Other than Batman Assault on Arkham and The Flashpoint Paradox, this is easily the most violent cartoon DC has ever produced. DO NOT let kids under 13 watch this! The best in the Lord of the Rings series. I watched the animated version back in the day and the live version is just as good, even better. If you like ancient warfare mixed with mythical creatures and magic duels, this is one of the best movies ever made. Highly recommended! This is clearly a precursor to The Sarah Conner Chronicles where people are Terminators and do not know it or are Terminators, know it, but still have emotions and old thoughts along with actual hearts and lungs, brains as well. Summer Glau does not star in this movie, however. T4 is as good or better than any of the other T movies and is action packed. Buy it if you have to mow lawns for pay! The best in the Lord of the Rings series. I watched the animated version back in the day and the live version is just as good, even better. If you like ancient warfare mixed with mythical creatures and magic duels," this is one of the best movies ever made. Highly recommended! If you like """"Push"""" or the """"X-Men"""" you will like this. Super-powered people who are being hunted down like witches because apparently they are all evil. A young man that can teleport just like Nightcrawler from the X-Men(maybe a lot further distance though) must fight for his life against a fanatical hunter bent on killing all people with special powers. VERY exciting and action packed! Superheros versus bad guys. 'Nuff said. Excelsior! Look at my review for Watership Down and ditto it. Kids cartoons the way they SHOULD be", not the premature sexuality and extreme violence of todays animation. I like Japanese animation but I am forty years of age. My kids are not. White Seal is a children's cartoon," the way they should be. """"Nuff said. The greatest pro wrestling match ever fought based on skill was/is Flair vs. Steamboat. 45 minutes of technical magic with limited fighting. Hogan vs. Andre or the Warrior sold more tickets due to hype", but true pro wrestling fans agree: Flair vs. Steamboat is the best match EVER. Steiners vs. Doom is also included and that's for starters! Easily one of the best events in wrestling ever! A must have for pro wrestling fans! THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE. I like horror movies and loved parts 1,2,3,4,and 5(part 6 was bad too but had vampire vs. werewolf action WAY before Underworld was released), but this Razzi is why the Razzi awards were invented. This is so bad I wanted to return it! NOT WORTH A PENNY and whoever produced this movie in Hollywood should be FIRED! An Army man is shot dead on a military base. The Pentagon sends in an agent. The agent soon discovers that multiple U.S. soldiers are involved in the drug business. The agent is now up against his own colleagues and it is his word against theirs. This is definitely a new approach that touches on a touchy subject. What if our own troops are the enemy? Although this is definite guilty pleasure material, what do you expect? An asteroid hits Earth causing an ice age. Humans are all but gone. Those who are alive are ruled by borderline Nazis. One woman fights out of poverty and takes on the elite. This movie is most similar to Barbwire starring Pamela Anderson which was not a bad movie( I would not call it Academy Award material either). Lots of action, sexy women, and guilty pleasures galore! The Von Erichs are LEGENDS in the sport with victories over Hogan, Flair, and Rude and many, many more. Kerry's match with Lawler is still talked about today(BLOOODY!). The Freebirds make multiple appearances on this collection as well.  Don't mess with Texas! Just because it's classic don't let that fool you; this is the funniest stuff ever produced and some of it is shockingly crude. It's nothing too obscene like modern comedy.  If you like your laughs more wholesome but not TOO wholesome, this fits your description of good comedy. Jenna Jameson and Ginger Lynn star in this scary movie that resembles The Hills Have Eyes but it is set in the U.K. in a forest. A horribly deformed man who is also cannibalistic hunts people who dare venture into the forest at night. Richard Grieco(21 Jumpstreet:TV Series, Booker) stars in this for about the first ten minutes. VERY bloody. A spiritual power is killing an entire town and is about to go global until the town builds a dam causing a flood to form a river over the cursed town. However, it takes more than that to get rid of ghosts. After 40 years of the town being underwater, strange events take place in the nearest town to the dam. Something was left unchecked underwater and is now making it's way to the surface. Something pure evil. A group of scientists wake up not knowing where they are but determine that they are underground somewhere. They also all have amnesia! All the exits are locked with no apparent way out. They soon discover that they are not alone. Mutated creatures start hunting them down for food in what can only be described as a horror fest! You have heard of werewolves right? What if there were such a thing as were-hyenas? You get the idea. If you like werewolf movies or horror movies in general, this is surprisingly good for a relatively unknown movie. This is one of SciFi's originals that even the toughest skeptics can honestly say that they enjoyed it. Wizards, witches, and warlocks galore engaging in magic duels and power laser fights! The warriors in this movie play second hand to the masters of magic. If you like the Dungeons & Dragons style entertainment," this is one of the best made for TV movies I have ever seen!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A2G5KL6WVDZFD6," A lovely film that I have seen twice.  The acting is superb and the scenery is mystical.  This movie made me want to learn to flyfish and I can see how easily it was to write a story around this beautiful art form and relate it to a family struggling to find peace. Clever with wonderful characters and when Matthew Broderick was at his best.  Humor mixed with drama - well done. A corny ending tops it off.  Like Princess Bride, this movie will always be fun to watch. Innocence is still alive and well. Lily Tomlin and Stevie are at their best in this silly, but fun movie.  I enjoyed it even ten years later.  Anyone who loves Steve when he twists up his face and body will enjoy this one. Put these two knuckleheads together and you have a comic book movie that turns out to be funny in just the right places.  Just think SNL and you'll enjoy this silly movie. I watch this wonderful movie every two years and am still deeply moved by the plot, the characters and the struggles within this family.  Expertly directed, skillfully acted and beautifully written.  One of my top ten's!  Cheers to Timothy Hutton, who made it all so believable. There hasn't been a better team since Martin and Lewis!  And the character actors surrounding them!  I adore this movie and have it in my collection for years to come.  Even my young adult children love it.  In all the humor of this movie, there is a moral theme that makes you melt. There's a Neal Page in everyone's life - think twice before moving them aside. I can't tell you how many times my children and I watched this when it first came out.  A wonderful fantasy with lessons to learn throughout.  The music is fun and the characters delightful. If you like quirky, which I do, you will like this movie.  Not much to explain, but a lot of effort was put into the characters.  Love the scenery and background gaudiness! Goofy the way we liked it back in the day.  Cute plot, cute actors, cute scenes. Even Lilly was cute - and that's almost amazing as she has never been cute beyond her little girl, Edith Ann, character in the giant rocking chair. Cleverly done with class and style, like a well written romance novel the chemistry is right on for these two leading roles. Perfect Peirce Brosnan has met his match with gorgeous Rene Russo and she doesn't miss a beat. Love the hat scene and the coolness of this fun movie. Kudos to Dennis Leary for creating a very likable character without the usual smirk.  Oooh la la! this is entertainment! You know those old Doris Day cuties?  Well this is like one of those...just precious.  The song at the end is too cute so I put it on a CD and listen to it when I feel like kissing a boy again.  Chick flick deluxe!  Enjoy ladies! Just enough cheezy to be good.  Likeable characters, and maybe the Vulcan will grow on me someday, but I swear, I think she might break out a pole and start pole dancing any minute! This is one of those sleeper movies that when you find it, you feel like you found the prize in the bottom of the Cracker Jack box.  Lots of quirky characters make this simple movie live and the messages are human and leave you thinking.  John is as usual his adorable self. What a neat plot, cool characters and a newcomer actress that took awhile to get used to until she melts your heart in a convincing crying jag scene that moves the movie forward. The interviewed characters are great!  Love the twist. The movie was below par and I couldn't grasp what everyone was saying, but I never pass up anything with Maggie Smith in it.  The plot is good, the actors are all faces you like to see in other productions, but the main character young boy didn't have what it takes to meld with the likes of Maggie Smith. Cute blast from the past.  Entertaining movie.  The clothes are so much fun to look at. Kathy Bates has only a bit part and not memorable, so don't get too excited about seeing the old gal in this one. Someone truly loved the original Star Trek characters to seek out these young actors who portray the gang beautifully.  Trekkies must be proud!  Lots of special effects, but most importantly, the dialog, the humor and the love the crew has for one another.  I will watch this one yearly. Really enjoyed the conflict between father and son about which direction to go in life. James Gandolfini was superb. His character portrayed the true spirit of a worried father watching his son chase a dream like millions of other kids did in the 60's and 70's - to no avail.  As a baby boomer, I can truly apologize now to my parents for being sucked into the era of ""do whatever pleases you"" at any expense. These actors worked there arse off in this movie!  Some scenes will really tear your heart out.  Naomi Watts and the son were a terrific team.  The special effects were amazing, too without going overboard.  Wow! One last try for good ole Redford!  Not a thrill movie at all, but the respect for this fine actor/director made me stay with it.  How much power does our press have?  Lots! Beautifully written, witty, charming, and thoroughly delightful.  Emma shines and Hanks, well, he never ever lets us down and so it goes. The three writers are fun to watch, too.  You will recognize the well known likable faces and their endearing expressions. I just now noticed the umbrella in the shadow.  My, those writers are clever, and that's exactly what this movie is...clever.  Enjoy movie lovers! This movie lacked a great deal, yet the special effects were fun to watch.  For that, it's worth seeing.  I think Clooney should've swapped places with Bullock; at least we could've seen more expression.  If anything, I could tell by the last look on his face that he wanted out of this movie. I particularly liked this movie because it was balanced - showing the weaknesses on both sides of the races instead of continuing to rate our beautiful black Americans as completely downtrodden.  The difficulties we have overcome since this bizarre time is a tribute to the American spirit.  Let's move forward as MLK would have it.  It's getting better and will continue with movies like this that show progress. Pleasurable to watch - the music is awesome.  Starts out a little clumsy, but moves forward and eventually the characters will captivate you.  A good movie to watch when you're in the mood for nostalgia.  Wish I could give it more stars, but alas, three ain't bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ACTEAPEPGDV8G," This is a wonderful film that very thoughtfully explores the life of a young genius who hides his light due to childhood abuse.  The story develops gracefully and is never overly dramatic.  Matt Damon and Robin Williams are especially good, but all the other actors come through exactly when needed.  I plan on seeing this again. Like I said, simply outrageous in all the best ways.  The thick accents did make it difficult to follow the dialogue at times, and I am pretty good at understanding accents.  Mark's withdrawal scenes in his bedroom were incredible.  Not just a heroin-is-bad story, but a true slice of life flick. Great movie, and I'm glad I didn't read the plot synopsis on this page, or it would have spoiled the entire movie for me.  Amazon.com, please delete it!  It's a major spoiler and totally inappropriate. This film was incredible!  The editing, sound and direction was powerful and explosive.  Ellen Burstyn gives the performance of her career as an aging Jewish mother and Jared Leto is her son; both fall into addictions that tear their lives apart.  This film is not for the squeamish, but those who watch it will come away from it with great respect for director Aronofsky's massive talent.  One of the best works of cinema out there, no kidding! This film was incredible!  The editing, sound and direction was powerful and explosive.  Ellen Burstyn gives the performance of her career as an aging Jewish mother and Jared Leto is her son; both fall into addictions that tear their lives apart.  This film is not for the squeamish, but those who watch it will come away from it with great respect for director Aronofsky's massive talent.  One of the best works of cinema out there, no kidding! This may be the best Cohn brothers' movie yet.  Stellar performances by all, and a plot that contains no loose ends adds up to a great nouveau film-noir flick that shows what could happen when an unsuspecting man starts to travel down the wrong road.  The ending is almost transcendant.  This is the kind of movie Albert Camus might have made if her were a film writer and director. I fail to understand how viewers can go on and on about the philosophical/psychological/sociological aspects of this film.  It's tacky, badly acted and scripted, and in general a third-rate movie.  Perhaps it indeed has a message, but it's lost in the presentation.  Not nearly as shocking or controversial as it is made out to be, Battle Royale is a must-miss movie.  Watch a film by Kurosawa or Ozu instead if you really want to see good Japanese filmmaking. One thing is for certain - when you watch something done by David Lynch, you'd better pay attention!  This movie inverts the protagonists-try-to-unravel-the-mystery cliche to present a story wherein the mystery/fantasy slowly dissolves into the real story, and the central characters are not revealed to us until the movie's final half-hour.  Still, this remains an enigmatic experience that disturbs and provokes, as Lynch's films always do.  Also, great performances all around. This sequel is quite uneven, alternating scenes of high energy and powerful emotion with scenes containing trite dialogue and silly stuff (the ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"" scene was SO bad!).  Still, it's worth watching, and the special effects associated with the Doctor Octopus character are super. Please don't waste your valuable time on this one.  The first hour is just a set up for the preposterous plot and lots of gore that follows.  It may cause some shivers and rapid heartbeats, but in the end, you'll feel cheated.  Try something else instead. I suppose the director of this film thought that if he put in some magical special effects, it would make this movie something special.  Unfortunately, the main story is filled with characters who are two-dimensional stereotypes (the evil man, the saintly mother, the housekeeper with a secret).  Although little Ofelia's fantasies are quite amazing and wonderful, they don't make up for a film that is brutal and dull at its core.  This was a great disappointment to watch. In the same vein as Crash and Pulp Fiction, this film deals with seperate stories whose characters accidently intersect (literally) at one point in the plot.  Very deftly edited and well-acted, Amores Perros is both beautiful and horribly real.  The dogs that populate the story also act as a binding thread in the narrative.  See it. This movie is so well done on so many levels, and that's why it works.  I'll let you read the other reviews to get more detail.  It suffices to say that this is a ""must see"" film.  However, I'm not sure why it became a cult film.  Yes, it has great depth, but I don't think I would want to watch it over and over.  Just check it out. I am watching the Sopranos at a feverish pace, and I love every season, but I had to give special mention to the episode in Season Three entitled ""Employee of the Month.""  Lorraine Brocco gives a performance that is nothing less than breathtaking, as Dr. Melfi is the victim of a violent crime.  You'll never forget the final few minutes of this one; it's the most powerful scene in the series so far.  Simply brilliant and devastating! Why this sitcom has become such a phenomenon is totally beyond me.  It is in no way funny and the writing is juvenile.  The characters are so one-dimensional it's ...  I just don't get it.  Maybe this is the intellectual low that the TV-viewing public has sunk to.  Read a book instead! Kill Bill is a riot of color, music, action, plot and character.  Tarantino takes you on an amazing ride that beats just about any other action movie ever made.  And with stars like these, how could he go wrong.  The animated sequence is just genius, and oh! Uma Thurman!  Her performance and presence is overwhelmingly wonderful.  Whoever doesn't like this doesn't have red blood streaming through their veins! American Splendor does a masterful job of blending the real with the ""reel,"" as we see Harvey Pekar and his real life family and friends on one hand, and the actors who portray them on the other.  Wonderful editing, acting and special effects make this a great film which is both fun to watch and an interesting portrait of an unconvential, fascinating man.  The movie flows so easily you'd almost think it made itself.  Recommended with great delight. I'm all for giving aspiring filmmakers and actors a break, but this film is such a clunker it's painful to watch.  The acting is unbearably clumsy and stupid, the script is just plain bad, and the cinematography is horrible.  It looks like a high school project; I have no idea how it made it to DVD at all.  A must to avoid. This is a great DVD, the practitioners are great, their movements are easy to follow, and the background scenery is beautiful.  Best of all, Qigong works!!  This gets my highest recommendation. Bad Education is a mesmerizing thriller about identity, revenge and blackmail.  Almodovar gives us a deep, many-layered story with facts that turn in on themselves and then turn out again.  My only reservation was with the ""what happened to the characters next"" part which comes before the movie's credits; although a kind of cosmic justice wraps everything up, it's a bit silly, but perhaps it was meant to be.  See it anyway, the performances are quite passionate. This is a wonderful disc that looks at Klaus Nomi from all angles.  His vocal and visual style both were unparalleled, and the footage of his first performance is nothing short of astonishing.  It's no wonder that an announcer frequently had to remind the audience that what they were hearing was not a recording - Klaus Nomi was the real thing.  Highly recommended for devotees of the avant garde. The acting was great, but I had a hard time hearing what some of the actors were saying (they seemed to mumble) and the plot was so convoluted I ended up with some questions I couldn't answer.  I really wanted to like this, but in the end I just kind of shrugged and moved on.  A pity, as it could have been a great film. Bland characters, murky filming and gratuitous gore make for a horror movie mess in The Descent.  I did not care one bit for the women or their fates.  If there's a sequel, count me out. The Visitor slowly builds in intensity of feeling without ever becoming overly dramatic.  All of the actors are fantastic in this story of immigrants in America and how we treat good people the same as undesirable ones, just because our immigration system is fatally flawed.  Highly recommended for the brilliant acting, which pulls an unexceptional plot into the realm of great art. This series is absolutely amazing, with the best photography I have ever seen of the landscape, the flora and the fauna of our incredible planet.  Watch it on Blu-Ray if you can, the images are crystal clear and the subject matter is absorbing.  Planet Earth will definitely give you a new appreciaton of the beautiful world in which we live.  A must for family viewing. First of all, why make a film that is an ""imaginary portrait"" of Diane Arbus?  It consists of a made-up story about Arbus and a neighbor with a medical condition that makes him hairy all over.  Kidman, of course, is wonderful, Robert Downey, Jr. is very disappointing, and ultimately the viewer is disappointed too.  I suppose Arbus' real life story wasn't interesting enough. Deadwood is my favorite TV show of all time, and I am very excited to hear that Amazon is going to be selling it in a Blu-Ray edition.  I can't wait.  The writing and acting on this show is simply amazing.  If you don't like the profanity on the show, well that's up to you, but underneath the crude exterior of Deadwood (it IS about the Old West) lies incomparable drama. This is a truly great indie film, probably one of the best to come out of the UK.  The acting is marvelous, especially the young man who plays Shaun.  It's a gritty, tough look both at how an ostracized child tries to fit in and how racism and patriotism collide in a Thatcher-era England.  Not to be missed, and the soundtrack is just great as well. An incredibly disappointing final season, with McNulty acting totally against character and a preposterous courtroom scene in episode 7, this really tarnishes the sterling reputation of this show.  They should have stopped at Season 4 rather than serve up this silly stuff. I really enjoyed Series One of Life on Mars, but the second is even better, with better stories and editing, and even better performances by a great cast.  I just saw the final episode yesterday and now realize I will really miss these characters and the 1973 Manchester setting where they lived and worked.  Once again, British TV proves superior - well done!

I just saw the final episode yesterday and now realize I will really miss these characters and the 1973 Manchester setting where they lived and worked.  Once again, British TV proves superior - well done! Hunger is a film with such power and beauty it's really difficult to convey the experience of watching it as to how impressive it really is.  The performance from Michael Fassbender as Bobby Sands is daring and scary, as he literally had to diet until his body became that of a man on a hunger strike.  The added feature with director Steve McQueen brings incredible insight to the art and humanity behind the film.  Without question, a must-see film. I was horrified to see the subtitles in this film displayed in such a small size, as white letters on an orange-red strip over the actual picture, rather than in a higher contrast format under the picture.  For me, the movie was literally unwatchable due to this.  Why was this done?  My eyes are not that strong, but this is ridiculous! Apparently the most exciting parts of this movie were contained in the theatrical trailer.  Although the acting is great, the story is slow-moving and not very eventful.  Worth a look if you are really interested in the subject, but otherwise you can pass it up without worry. This is one case where the Criterion version of a DVD really makes a big difference in the quality of the film.  I liked Wings of Desire the first time I saw it, but this new version is clean and beautiful.  Seeing it this way a second time made more of an impression on me. WOD is a subtle and tender movie about being human, and it is fascinating to learn about how the film was put together. This show is a real disappointment, as you can see from all the overwhelmingly bad reviews.  Don't waste your time and money on this one.  Terrible plot, bad acting, just say no to this turkey. While Seasons 1 to 3 were excellent, Season 4 really jumped the shark, with ridiculous plot lines that really ruined the momentum of this great show.  Season 5, the final one, is a bit better, but I could avoid seeing 4 again.  Only for die hards. I saw this movie with my Mom and sister-in-law.  They loved it.  I didn't hate it, but it was quite forgettable, other than for the always-commanding presence of Vanessa Redgrave.  I hate to sound like a Neanderthal, but if you're a female, you'll probably like it. I've seen the Swedish version of Dragon Tattoo, but the American version is much better.  Daniel Craig is as good as usual, and Rooney Mara portrays Lisbeth Salandar exactly the way I pictured her when reading the novel.  The movie has the requisite moodiness and the final scene is perfect.  My only objection is the sometimes-annoying soundtrack by Trent Reznor, although the opening credits and music are phenomenal. Never mind that this movie takes mythology and twists it around until it is unrecognizable, the CGI effects and the noisy soundtrack seem tailor-made for adolescent boys who just want to see things blow up.  When the characters hit each other it sounds like a car hitting a wall.  Childish, stupid and embarassing. And the acting? Don't ask. MIB 3 is very entertaining, and the addition of Josh Brolin as the younger version of K is inspired.  The plot is surprisingly tight and the action is constant and lots of fun to watch.  I haven't seen MIB 2, but this may be the best of the three.  I'm only sorry I couldn't see it in 3D.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are great! I have no idea why people like this movie.  The pacing is fine, but there's absolutely no substance whatsoever to the story.  It's dialogue, action, and very little actual content when in comes to the lives of the Beat Generation writers.  The characters come off as off-the-cuff commentators, and the result is a total bore.  Please skip this one. Don't miss this one.  It's got a drop of Twin Peaks in it, a performance by the amazing Elizabeth Moss, and the incredible grandeur of New Zealand.  A fantastic ensemble of actors and great story rounds it out.  I couldn't figure out whodunit, and the ending came as a big surprise.  Very entertaining and involving, but so dense you could write an essay on it.  Top of the Lake is top notch. James Franco has done well by William Faulkner and taken a major twentieth-century novel and turned it into a poetic masterpiece.  I was a bit leery about the split-screen concept but it works very well.  Rather than being a distraction, the technique adds a layer of understanding to the story's perspective.  The acting is superb, especially the actor who plays Anse (his performance is a revelation).  It's quite an achievement to pull something like this off so well. I really got into the mood and the charcters of Llewyn Davis, and the music was really wonderful.  This is a very understated film from the Coen Brothers, but one I consider another hit.  The cat really makes the film, by the way, and when you see John Goodman in a Coen Bros. film, you know you're in for a wild ride.  Nicely done and acted. What a letdown this final season is turning out to be!  I really can't find any character to like anymore, they have either become very unsympathetic or donwright unlikeable.  The others are underutilized.  I am only staying with Mad Men because it has been so great up until now, but judging by these episodes, they should have ended the show last season.  Let's hope Part Two shows an improvement. I suppose the director of this film thought that if he put in some magical special effects, it would make this movie something special.  Unfortunately, the main story is filled with characters who are two-dimensional stereotypes (the evil man, the saintly mother, the housekeeper with a secret).  Although little Ofelia's fantasies are quite amazing and wonderful, they don't make up for a film that is brutal and dull at its core.  This was a great disappointment to watch.

A39O4OE7GY92I7," Of all the positive things I could say about this gorgeous, wonderful, thoroughly entertaining film, perhaps that should be pointed out most of all ! When you hear ""4 hour movie,"" your eyes glaze over...unless you love films...and this is truly one of those films. Great work Kevin, and thank you. The new transfer is crystal clear, the colors are bright, I can even see during the night scenes now ! The extras are all entertaining, and informative, just so worth the few extra bucks Criterion demands for taking our finest films and preserving them for my Grandson. If ONLY they would give "" Easy Rider "" the Criterion treatment now... I was there that night. September 12th, 1975, MTSU's Murphy Center. Tickets were priced low, and it went on for hours. Granted, with today's HD TVs, and players, the video  hasn't aged well, but the audio is still great !!! Having also attended the World Premiere, with Charlie, Toy, and the rest of the boys, I really waited a long time for this to come out on home video. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I found this on Amazon UK for 57% off, AND they're shipping it via UPS and I'll have it in 2 days !?!?!? That's approx. $ 109.00 in American dollars. Granted, it's region 2, but if you have a region-free player like I do...nobody will watch your money better than YOU !!! The new transfer is crystal clear, the colors are bright, I can even see during the night scenes now ! The extras are all entertaining, and informative, just so worth the few extra bucks Criterion demands for taking our finest films and preserving them for my Grandson. If ONLY they would give "" Easy Rider "" the Criterion treatment now... Not only did I get the first 4 seasons for HALF PRICE, but as I said above, I am THOROUGHLY entertained, and happy with my purchase. I had forgotten $ 7,000 annual salaries, and 26 minute episodes (yes, the show used to rule, NOT the commercials ),not to mention the bonus of mini-skirts. I recommend this Classic show very highly. HI GUYS ! The new transfer is crystal clear, the colors are bright, I can even see during the night scenes now !

HI GUYS ! Being a lifelong fan of Georgie boy (50 years),and already possessing all the other HBO specials ( All My Stuff ),and enjoying this last one before we even knew it'd be the last...sigh...and checking daily for a pre-order page...well, I understand "" reviewing before releasing."" We'll never see the likes of Georgie boy again... Literally. Have to keep wiping my eyes, I'm laughing so hard ! NOTHING this funny anymore, we're all too damn sensitive and politically-correct now !!! As far as the packaging: GET OVER IT. I have other DVDs with the same more than one disc on a spindle, and there is no problem. Be thankful you can still get these treasures AT ALL !!! That, and my local news. I gave up 18 months ago, too many commercials, not enough quality. So for THIS to be the only exception should tell you something. Now add to that that all 4 previous season DVDs have gotten 5 star reviews for both video, and the 5.1 audio, and you can't lose !!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2AKDKY2LNMQVK," Definitely a woman's movie. Sally Fields, Dollie Parton, Shirley MacLaine and Olympia Dukakis are real close friends.  They portray southern woman. The story is their life story,  Julia Roberts plays Sally Fields daughter and Daryl Hannah is a hair dresser.  There is so much to this movie. Funny, sad and a good movie for the girls to bring out the tissues. Great story and great actresses. This is a family movie.  How the family sticks together thru thick and thin.  The father Tom Skerritt is a preacher. Brad Pitt is out of control.  Gambling, bootlegging, etc.  The movie is really about the good and bad of things that go on through the families life.  Great movie. If you want suspense, you got it.  A woman has a husband you want to kill, a daughter who needs to love her mother as least a little bit.  A cop (Christopher Plummer) who is so mean you want to do away with him like the husband. The ending is one heck of a shocker.  . Kathy Bates is an awesome actress and she really shines in this one. (Michelle Pfeiffer) is a Hawk by Day, a real person by Night.  (Rutger Hauer) is a person by DAY and a wolf by Night. A very young Matthew Broderick  has a major part in all of this.  Story of how to lovers had a curse put on them by a very evil Bishop, Eventually they become human at the same time.  Very good fantacy. Peter O'Toole plays King Henry II and Katharine Hepburn his queen Eleanor. They have three sons that struggle to win their father's favor, as well as his crown. O'Toole and Hepburn engage in a battle of royal wits that pits elder son against his brothers. Then there is cunning King Philip of France (Timothy Dalton) who takes advantage of the inernal fracturing in his bid to destroy their kingdom. Great movie, lot of action. If you want to see a great movie this is it.  Kevin Costner is great, he is a soldier that is assigned to a broken down outpost. When he was assigned to this post it was an active place.  Meets friendly Indians.  He befriends them, winds up living with them and almost transforms himself into an Indian. Scenery is awesome.  Just one great movie. Bing Crosby plays Father O'Malley, a young priest new to an established but finanically ridden parish. When his way of doing things clash with the priest that has run the parish for a long time. . Barry Fitzgerald plays Father Fitzgibbon. The two finaly meet in the middle and save the parish. Some songs by Crosby.  Very good movie.  Great family movie. This is a fast moving  film.  I am from PA and know what the Amish believe in. This stands true to form in this movie. Harrison Ford has no idea who the good and bad guys are at police headquarters.  He's a good cop and some of the higher ups in the department are trying to kill him along with the young Amish boy who witnessed the murder of someone. The ending is a surprise.  Great movie. If you want action, this is the one, his daughter is kidkapped, he goes after them, he steals this womans car, he explains what has happened to his daughter.  She helps him, what really helps is she knows how to fly small planes. That plays into how he gets from where he is to where his daughter is.  A lot of action.  A typical for Schwarzenegger movie. If you want action, it is all here.  Great actors.  The special effects are great considering this is an older movie when they didn't have computers like now..  I have seen the remake of this movie with Kurt Russell. Give me the original.  Some movies just do well when they are remade. The robbery they pull off is far fetched,  it might have been able to do this back in the day.  4 guys that where in the army together scheme to rob a lot the casinos in Las Vegas.  How they prepare, plan and execute this theft is awesome. Frank Sinatra/Sammy Davis Jr/Dean Martin and Peter Lawford are great together. Baby sitter takes kids into the city because her friend needs a ride home. First thing is, she IS NOT suppose to take the kids into the city.  It goes from there to an adventure of mistakes and getting into and out of situations.  Cute movie.  Has some foul words. It takes place in Hong Kong. William Holden is a struggling American artist who's down on his luck. Nancy Kwan is a beautiful Chinese prostitute who captures his heart. It's a soul searching look at East-meets-West love story. Its a wonderfully warm story about the strength of true love.  The scenry is spectacular. Elizabeth Tayor is from the east, Rock Hudson is from Texas.  He so full of himself about Texas,  Taylor really gets to him in more ways than one.  The bases of this story is the life of 3 generations.  Their trials and tribulations.  Also James Dean plays a major roll in this movie. Very good for this time period.  Clean movie, no nudity. It is an old movie and was good for the time it was made. In this movie Gregory Peck park made him a very mean man.  I just don't picture him in this roll.  I guess I'm use to his later movies. This is one science fiction that is way out of the box.  A machine talks and act human.  The woman is forced to have it's baby.  I won't say any more, this is one movie you should buy if you want a good sci fiction. The whole movie is dumber than a rock yet it turns out to be really funny.  Here's a KID that gives the bad guys a really bad time and I mean bad time.  It's an oldie but goodie and it is a funny movie. I am a Sam Elliott fan from way back.  This story is just a simple love story done in the western era.  What is nice is that he is looking for the woman attaching little poems on tumbleweed.  In real life Katherine Ross is his wife. It is a story of Diplomats, soldiers and other representatives of a dozen nations fending off the siege at the international compound in Peking during the 1900 Boxer Rebellion.  They all unite for survival despite the boxers and overwhelming odds. There was help coming but it was delayed. It is a very violent movie.  Movie not for children. It's a goofy funny movie, M. Monroe is totally blind w/out her glasses, bumps into every thing. L. Bacall is the class act in this movie. Has a good story line, about 3 women looking to marry millionaire's.  Great Clasic. This movie is as they say a ""woman's movie""  The woman is a Eurasian and he is a war corespondent. There is interracial prejudices as she is Eurasian. They meet in Hong Kong , fall in love,then he is transferred to Korea where war has broken out. This happens late in the movie.  This is truly a love story. Well done for the time 1955.  Very clean movie, no nudity or foul language. Schwarzenegger/ Jami Lee Curtis/Tom Arnold are a hoot.  Arnold/Schwarzenegger are secret agents, Curtis thinks he is a salesman.  It gets rolling when they have to go on a mission,  Curtis is being coned by this guy (Bill Paxton) Schwarzenegger finds out and then the fun begin.  Great action movie and I mean action. This film is awesome.  It has more twist and turns you would ever want in an older movie.  The main story is about sables. These animals are only bred and raised in Russia according to this film.  A lot of action and William Hurt is the main person in this movie who is smart enough to realize what is going on.  The sables are what this film is about.  A very good movie. Casper is a ghost and becomes friends with a living person. It's what happens to Casper interacting with other humans, then throw in some other ghosts. It is a funny movie, it does have a few sad moments and the other ghosts are not very nice. Later in the movie they become a little nicer. Omar Sharif ,Julie Christie, Rod Steiger and Geraldine Chaplin who plays Sharif wife. The jest of the story is about a doctor/poet who is married falls for a political activists wife and experiences hardships during the Bolshevik Revolution. Things happen to him and his family all through this movie. It is very hard to explain all what happens.  A must buy movie. Movie is really about a city slicker who at the start of this movie thinks Glen Ford is a hard man with no feelings. He gets a reality check later in the movie and becomes worse that Glen Ford could ever be.  Good western. It was funny, lot of twist and turns, good plot. Who ever wrote the script for Kevin Kline should be ashamed of himself.  It made this very good actor look like a total idiot and look like a fool. Elizabeth Tayor is from the east, Rock Hudson is from Texas.  He so full of himself about Texas,  Taylor really gets to him in more ways than one.  The bases of this story is the life of 3 generations.  Their trials and tribulations.  Also James Dean plays a major roll in this movie. Very good for this time period.  Clean movie, no nudity. On the sad side.  John Travolta and Kyra Sedgwick are great together.  Travolta goes from a very normal person to someone that can learn a foreign language in 10 minutes. He can't sleep and reads 10 books a day.  There is very sad reason this is happening to him.  Highly recommend this for the family. This is a classic Disney movie.  About a little girl (Haley Mills) who comes to a town that has feuds and is intimidated by her aunt.  By the time she leaves she has turned the community into a transformed place. Her will to see the good side of the worst and she brings out the good in this community .  This DVD was purchased for my local library. This is a great Sci-Fi.  Lo, Jupiter's intermost moon hosts mining colony Con-Am 27. A high-tech hellhole. Connery plays veteran marshal who probes some unexplained deaths of the miners.  He's trying to find the truth and no one is helping him. The men are taking some thing and he want to know they are taking that and why they are die from it.is  How he finds this out is what the movie is all about. It is a war movie with a twist, the woman is a nun.  It is about how they survive together and get free from the Japanese. If you like Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr then you know this is a great movie. It is a funny movie, we have sci-fi, love, and weird things happening, like changing Martin Short into looking like someone else. It's a good clean movie, some violence.  This is defently a clean funny sci-fi.  Not on the dark side like some of the current movies that give you nightmares.. This movie has a lot of suspense and action.  Clint Eastwood is an older master jewel thief. Throw in Gene Hackman as the bad guy with the most power in our nation. Eastwood witnesses something while robbing the house of one the key players  The movie really gets rolling after that. If you like suspense, here it is. Also there is a daughter that they also want to kill along with Eastwood. It was funny, lot of twist and turns, good plot. Who ever wrote the script for Kevin Kline should be ashamed of himself.  It made this very good actor look like a total idiot and look like a fool. It is about one robot's 200 year journey to become an ordinary man. He is purchased as a mere ""household appliance.  It's doesn't take long for the Martin family to realize Andrew  (Williams)  is NO RUN-OF-THE-MILL ROBOT.  With the help of a sciencetist played by Oliver Platt, he starts the journey.  He has a lot of adventures in his journey to become human.  Great movie. Robin Williams will be missed . We lost a great comedian. It is just a cute movie.  Wall-E is a robot doing what he was built for, the curious and lovable Wall-E discovers a new purpose in life when he meets a sleek search robot named Eve. This a really funny movie with a funny cast of characters on a fantastic  journey across the universe. Great for kids. Two families coming together and what happens.  Doris Day has never played a bad person that I know of.  She gives Brian Keith's daughter some good advice which helps her understand that Day isn't trying to replace her mom which had passed away.  It's just a good old fashion movie.  Sorry, no cuss words, violence or anything blowing up like there is today in movies.  Great for the younger kids. Great actors, Field, Harris, Clover, Malkovich, Crouse are the main people other than the children. Fields husband is a cop, he is killed, she is trying not to loose her farm.  Crouse is Fields sister.  It's a movie that has tornadoes, cheating, loving, charity and many other emotions rolled up into one movie.  Some scenes are not for the children. It takes place in the depression, so times are really hard.  Great movie If you are into science fiction, this is the movie.  I think in the not to far future this is a possibility.  A robot takes on human ways of thinking,and acting which was not suppose to happen.  Will Smith, knows this robot can think and act on his own, but no one will believe him. Buy the movie and find out how it all falls into place. Movie is all about finding the treasure .  Cage has to find the clues that lead to the ""National Treasure"". In the process of looking for these clues, he gets into more situations, some are funny, then there is a man after the same thing, he is following Cage so he can steal it from Cage.  Movie is about how they eventually get to the treasure, lot of action and almost death situations.  Great action movie. This is a true story.  About the Man in Black.  Johnny Cash is played by Joaquin Phoenix, June Carter is played by Reese Witherspoon. It's about one man's unwavering devotion to his sound, his message and the greatest love of his life. Both the actors did their own singing.  No lip sinking.  (Checked to make sure before I made the statement that they did sing themselves).  Awesome movie.  If you liked Johnny Cash, you will like this movie. I would recommend this movie.  It's a hoot.  3 friends that get into situations that are funny.. "" I would not recommend this movie for some one under 16.""  There is a couple situation that are very sexual. This movie is a wonderful love story and it tells how two lonely people come together on a stormy night. All I can say, it's one good love story and James Garner and Julie Andrews are a good match.  If I say to much it will give the story away. Misleading.  If you read the back of the cover it mentions that the movie is about the civil war, this is not true.  These stars were young and the acting was awful. Thank goodness they got a whole lot better as they got older. You laugh, cry,  get mad all in one movie.  Now there is also(it's pay back time)  When you see the movie you will know why this fits right into the scheme of things.  The bases of this movie is a husband you want to beat with a stick, a woman that gets even with him and then there's a guy that falls for her and helps her thru the mess which is her life.  Not for children. It is a movie you need to watch if you like people that have different abilities than the normal people around us. Like ESP, seeing the dead etc.  It has a lot of twists and turns in it , the ending is a surprise. This a follow up of The Da Vinci Code.  In this movie Hanks pursues ancient clues on a hunt through Rome to find the four Cardinals kidnapped by the deadly secret society. Hanks races through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs and the most secretative vault on Earth. This is one action filled movie.  You won't get bored watching this movie. George Clooney is awesome.  He is a man that can't believe what his wife did behind his back, then his family wants him to sell some property that has been in the family for hundreds of years. Here's the kicker, it is filmed in Hawaii as the family live on the island. The scenery is awesome.  Can't say anymore about the movie, don't want to give the good stuff away. Movie not for young children. If you want to laugh until you cry this is the movie. It kind of reminds me of Heaven can wait, but this one is absolutely out of the box funny. I like this movie and would highly recommend it. This is an older movie (1970)  but it has a great story line.  Very humanized. A man decides to kill himself while flying to Europe.  Great special effects considering how old this movie is.  If you like action, this movie has it and much more. Movie is all about finding the treasure .  Cage has to find the clues that lead to the ""National Treasure"". In the process of looking for these clues, he gets into more situations, some are funny, then there is a man after the same thing, he is following Cage so he can steal it from Cage.

A2R3JI8YFCAK90," This movie has everything in it. You'll laugh and you will cry. Its about these women that do nothing but talk about each other, They seem to meet at the beauty shop all the time. Julia Roberts plays a girl that has some type of illness. You will end up laughing at some of the tings that these woman do. I loved Patsy Cline's music from went I a young girl. So when the movie came out I loved it. Jessica does a wonderful job playing Patsy Cline. Even tho she pretended to sing Patsy Cline's songs. She still did a wonderful job. This is Patsy life and her marriage to Charlie and boy was it rocky,  Its just to bad that she died at an early age. She was a wonderful singer. This was one of Patrick Swayze's better movies. I saw it years ago and have always liked it. He is a truck driver and is transporting illegal items. He didn't know what he was transporting until things started happening. His family was being held against their will to make sure that Patrick was delivering the goods. It was a good movie to watch and you didn't get bored with it. Saw this movie years ago and because it was a true story I brought it.  This movie had some funny moments in it, but it really was about how well he did in martial arts.  It happens to be a good story about his life. It starts out with his life in his younger years.  Then its shows how he starts a school and teaches martial arts. It tells how fast he became famous. Its an interesting story. El Dorado is a movie I saw sometime ago. It had a lot of major stars in it. Its another good old time movie that I would tell anyone to watch. I loved this movie. Patrick did a great job in this. He played a bouncer at a bar. There was one man that ran to town that the bar that he went to work for was in. He takes this run down bar that had everything happening in it from drugs to stealing and turns it into a well run bar. But not without problems from the one man. I got this to replace the one that I had on tape. This movie is the ususal  Elvis movie. Boy meets girl and they fall in love, but what I feel that was different is that I think that Elvis doing the shimmy was better then Anne Margaret's dancing. So to me it was good. I love this movie, but I ordered the wrong one. So it will be going to the half price book store here and I will be ordering the one that will play in my Blu-ray. I love Tom Cruise in this. He is a real hunk in this movie. Be still my heart. He plays this role great and the real Jerry Maguire isn''t  as handsome as Tom. He is an agent for these football players. He gets fired and starts his own company with only one player. He gets this one player to do his best and makes it big. This writer goes on an adventure that is unforgettable. Her sister is in trouble she has to find her. Everything happens to her on this trip. She hires this man to help her and ends up falling in love. This movie is funny. This definitely is an adventure. I don't know of any babysitter that would leave with taking the kids to pick up a friend. She had one event after another happen in this movie. This is a good movie for kids to watch. This is one of Gregory great movies. He does a lot of tap dancing in it. It has a lot of stars in it. The tap dancing is wonderful and a lot of old tap dancers do their thing showing that they still can do their thing. This is funny and good and romantic. I loved seeing this movie years ago and I love seeing it now. I love a lot of Tom Hanks movies. This movie is so funny. I love to laugh and this one did it, He is getting married to this girl, he goes to dinner at her folks house and states these out ragist things. This is just one event after another that make you laugh all through the movie. This is another movies that I saw years ago that I felt was a good romance. Eric Roberts was so handsome back then. What a hunk he was. I was happy to see that in the end the girl realized that she was in  laugh with Eric. I got this because I have the newer version of it. I thought that I would compare both of the to see the differences. They are pretty much the same, but there are a couple of differences. They both are very good movies and very enjoyable. I was glad to see that Ricki Lake was in the newer vision. I thought that was pretty cool. This movie is very good. I saw it on tv years ago. Its about a man that decide to murder someone. because he wants to know what it feels like. He picks this girl that has this boyfriend. The boyfriend can do nothing, but think of what happened to her. He does everything that he can to find her, but its his present girlfriend that stops him from becoming the second victim. A great movie. This is about this young man that is a ballroom dancer.  His dance partner decides to dance with someone else. He then decides to teach a young girl the dances, but she and her family ended up teaching him some dance moves. His parents and judges gave him a lot of pressure over the new dance steps and who he wanted to dance with. It was a good movie. This movie I saw back in the 80's. I loved the romance in it. I found that I was wishing for her to stay with him instead of her going back to her people. That is probably the only disappointment that I had. Paul is a middle aged man that gets in trouble with the law all the time. He gets ticket after ticket all the time and doesn't pay them. He just throws them into his glove compartment. He trys to get closer to his son. He does some really funny things in this movie. I loved it. This was a disappointment to me. I thought that the mother was going to be in love with indian, but she wasn't. The indian was in love with her. She ran away and left her kids there. It wasn't a good romance at all. This is a very funny movie. Chevy is engaged to Farrah and she has a son. Her son comes up with the idea that they should join this club and get to know each other. They whole idea of this is to make Chevy break up with his mom. It ends up that they get closer and her son gets to like him. I was disappointed with this movie. I would of liked to of seen more romance in this. There was cheating and boys planning to kill a person and it turns out a girl kills a guy. I just didn't like it. I love this race movie. Its funny and has a lot of top stars in it. Its an old movie, but still good. My son from on the online that they do still have races like this. The last one he found the drivers showed that they kepted getting ticker after ticket. Whoopi is such a great actress. This movie I felt was so funny. She did so good with turning herself into a man. I try to get movies that make me laugh. I hate movies that I loose interest in. I haven't seen a bad movie of Whoopi's yet. I saw this movie years ago. I loved it then and love it still. Shaquille is so funny in this movie. I would tell any family to get this movie. Shaq plays a genie in this movie. He ends up with this boy that gars into trouble. Shaquille helps him with a number of events. I have a collection of Elvis movies. All of his movies they have him falling for the girls in them. Girls just loved Elvis. They wanted to see him no matter what. Love this movie. You will laugh through the whole  movie. Its about Richard being a nutty professor, claiming to have found a tribe of Indians, when he really didn't. He makes up all these different things that are so funny. He dresses up as the chief and he just does one thing after another. I love movies that make me laugh. This is one of them. This is one that Charlie and brother are funny in. They are garbage men and they break all the rules. I love true stories and this is one. It tell about what they went through. It showed how they had their songs rated. it showed how some drank and got on drugs. The songs that got sung on this movie, you'll find yourself sing. These are about  the Nelson Family from the time the boys were really young to when they were in high school. They are all wonderful stories that I loved when I was a young girl. My family and I watched them weekly. Along with the Donna Reed Show, Father Knows Best and others. I love true stories, award winning stories, romantic and stories that make me laugh. This story is a true story and it made me laugh. I fell in laugh with it when I first saw and I still  love to watch it. This is a good movie. These three convicts are so funny. George Clooney talks them into everything and George is doing everything that he can to get back to his wife. He fines out that his wife is planning on marrying another man. Even other this is an import I was luck enough that it came in English. This story is about another coach. The story takes place in Tenn. in the sixties. What the coach did to get these players to get along was great. These kids learned to like each other, they had to. This is a movie about Ray Charles life. I loved t. he music. I've always been a big fan of Ray Charles. It shows his young brother dying and when he went blind. All the trouble he went though to make it in the music business. The movie is wonderful, but they CD that I got was used and kepted stopping. It will be given to the half price book story here. This movie is great. Its about this detective Al Pacino. He has this thing that with any murders investigating he can stop thinking about them. So he can't put these things aside to rest or get some sleep. He does end up find that person that is doing these murders in the end. This like a ""Who done it"" movie and its very good. I love movies that make me laugh. This is one of them. This is one that Charlie and brother are funny in. They are garbage men and they break all the rules. This movie I saw back in the 80's. I loved that he fell in love with this girl that had high morals. He protected her. A very important man wanted her out of the way. He was to kill her, but he innocent she was protect her from other hit men. It was a good story and it kepted you interested. This is about a grandfather that tells a story in parts to everyone. He has his grandson take him this union that the Indians have yearly. The grandson was always getting into trouble, but driving his grandfather made him a better person. The stories that the grandfather told were very interesting. They were about what a worrier went through. This is a movie about Ray Charles life. I loved t. he music. I've always been a big fan of Ray Charles. It shows his young brother dying and when he went blind. All the trouble he went though to make it in the music business. The movie is wonderful, but they CD that I got was used and kepted stopping. It will be given to the half price book story here. This is a boy that takes up boxing. He is mad over everything. He wants to always get in fights with everyone. I thought that it was going to be better then it was. I wasn't really happy with this. I love how Will Smith is so calm with his child in this movie.  This is a true story and one for the collection. It shows all that he went through in trying to sell the piece of machinery. He went from hospital to hospital with no luck, his wife leaves him. He is left to take care of his son and he does a wonderful job of it. I saw this movie along time ago. This is a wonderful musical. The dancing, the music, and singing makes this one of the best movies ever made and watch. This is one to keep for your collection. My son buys every movie that he see. This was one of them. He is trying to get all blu-rays.  This is one of Will Smith movies that was good, but not one of my favorites. I saw this movie along time ago. This is a wonderful musical.

I got a little bored with. This movie was about adults turning into their kids. The kids then went to work in place of their parents. The only thing I found funny was Pauly Shore standing on a ladder, pouring cereal over his head and falling off the ladder coming down. I didn't realize that I had this one already. The best one that I like out of these three movies was the American Ninja. I'm a big fan of Michael Dudikoff. I love in this movie. I got this  for the movie ""Another Stakeout."" I watched the other movies Money for Nothing and Disorganized Crime and didn't find them good at all. Another Stakeout was as funny as the first movie and Rosie was great in it. I was laughing from beginning to end in it. I ordered this, because this is the movie on the life of George Gershwin. It has to do with what he went through growing up. I would and will buy anything that is of George. I love his music and will always buy it if its really George himself playing it. I got this movie because I was look for one movie that James Spader  did.  This movie ""Tuff Turf"" was okay, but I would of like to seen more action form James. It made me think of the movie ""Rebel Without a Cause"", where this kids are always beating him up. He doesn't stand up for himself until the end. As for the other movie it was a waste of time. I found it boring and didn't keep interested. I loved ""The Associate"". The associate is a movie that still happens today. This is a man's world and women have to go through a lot to get ahead. I just love all that she did to make it. This is funny and its one of Whoopi's best. I saw this movie a couple of years ago and loved it. The music is wonderful in it. There is so many songs that are so well done. This movie show what these artist when through. They cheated, got arrested, took drugs, got drunk and got beaten up. It showed the hard ships that these performers when through. This is a good movie for everyone to see. What a great movie this. I really enjoyed it. This movie showed Jesus as being more passionate, friendly and smiled more then most of the other  movies. This was about his life, it was more believable. Its a movie that I would let my family show. I show this movie years ago. James Spader plays a bad boy ex-con type. He does a wonderful job of it. He has also black hair which he looks really hot. His wife cheats and so does he. He has a plan to black mail this one man that killed a call girl. But it back fires and  this man that murdered he girl comes after him and trys to kill him.

The movie is from the time of when I was growing up. This was how it was in he 50's.  They dressed that way and your bad boys were known as hoods. They also rode Harleys and drove fast cars. The only thing that I have to say is John Doe didn't play a very good bad boy. He really should of looked into It more. This is one of Michael's better movies. Its about the president gets hi-jacked in his plane. The plane has a bomb on it and the hi-jackers are wanting money. So Michael and some other military men are flown up the plane to disarm the bomb and kill the hi-jackers. He kills the hi-jackers, then he realizes that he has to fly the plane and land it. Its a good movie. It kepted me interested in it. This movie I saw back in the late 70's or early 80's. I just loved it. Its about a young couple. They are so cute in  this movie that I just laughed from beginning to end. I'm so happy that I found. This will be one for my collection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2UYESWHWMY6V3," Hard to believe that Roger Moore was potentially pegged to play the Jackal in this movie. Edward Fox took this role and made it his own. Great movie and I mean great!!!!!!!! Time has not decreased it's effectiveness either. Wow Its the little moments that prove this is one is a comedy masterpiece. And where is your other hand? Why between the pillow........Thats not a PILLOW!!!!!!!!! Great!!  Yeah this one is a keeper. Hard to believe 22 years have passed as well as John Candy. Wish the same team would have a made a sequel. Hope/Crosby......Lewis/Martin.........Martin/Candy. Oh well only a wish now.  Still a holiday classic. The first time i saw this junk I thought I was watching a dubbed foreign film. Its not so awful its funny category its just awful and had stand ins for criss and frehley since they were so high and drunk most of the time. A true piece of kiss crap. This one screams we did it for the money but with Simmons and Stanley you knew that. Rock Bottom awful. Wow what a great Ben-Hur (minus the Christian theme) faux type film. Crowe makes this film a real triumph and the action-fighting scenes are great but is it me or were the Gladiator fights filmed too fast as in they were over before they began. Loved the Hans film score and the computer look of Rome was great. Now, its time to unleash Hell or simply Gladiator 2- The Sequel.. Yes I liked this one more than the original!!!!!!!!! The updated special effects, music and acting were freshened to make this Omen quite enjoyable. I always felt the original was less a Horror movie and much more a drama with some creepy moments. This one felt more like a good horror movie thru and thru. Lets hope they do the Omen sequels too. Why repeat what others have said already. The movie affectd me emotionally for 5 days. Even when I go to the local Blockbuster and see the film on the shelf I feel a deep reverence for such a fine film. This is a masterpiece. For all their hype-the Martin S., Spielbergs, Kubricks and Hustons-this one tops them all. Wow!!!!!!!! Such a wonderful film about birds and the various migrations of the different kinds. What I love about this movie is that I able te see how God is so apparent in his design on nature and life. The story is simple yet if you watch it with your heart one can see the beautiful grand design the creator has in nature herself. Awesome movie for all ages.

This one screams we did it for the money but with Simmons and Stanley you knew that. Rock Bottom awful. Great 80's action flick. Think of Patrick Swayze in this role and you get the idea. Remar was probably third or fourth choice but he was good in the lead. This is a great grade B movie all the way. Just love the feel and look of the movie. Love it!!!!!!! Wow, what a terrific off beat Dario Argento type satanic horror film. Has neat Heavy metal soundtrack and real interesting plot premise about the end of days and Satan coming round the bend. With a nifty climax this movie is one of those you love to tell your friends about. Recommended. If you like The Omen you will like this. Saw this movie again for a second time in the last 2 years and I must say it plays like a good old fashioned classic. The acting is of course terrific and the music and photography top notch. The storyline itself is so deeply touching and that ending is so moving. No need to add the verbage the others have already added in other reviews .........Just see it. Wow I loved this movie. But what does that mean to you? Well, If you enjoy mystery/suspense/horror type cinema with over the top endings you will love this one. The sets, colors , acting, music all were fantastic. If you like down to earth by the numbers movies forget it. A great movie. Saw this movie again for a second time in the last 2 years and I must say it plays like a good old fashioned classic.

What a cheap and pale rip-off of the great French thriller THEM. This will impress simple minds and those who don't understand the nuances of how to make a good and effective horror-thriller movie. Boring as was the acting medicore. Try THEM on for size. Went to see Departures tonight. Wow only 8 patrons watching this great, no super great film. The Japanese have much greater reverence for the newly and dearly departed than in the USA. Just a spectacular film of the heart on all levels. This one has a profoundly moving ending and am going to buy this on on DVD immediately. Dont miss it but be prepared to shed the tears if you have a heart that is. Just a quick review-Very touching movie of those lives affected by the viel of death or near death experience. Great acting, story and music. The ending is wonderful for those who like a sentimental close. I loved Cecil de France especially. The music is terrific throughout and listen to the end credits score as well. No need to repeat what others have said. Just will comment that I myself loved the movie for the jaw dropping cinematography ,great acting, very realistic violence and interesting story. This one was awesome. And it was in english no subtitles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ARHBKPDOREUTX," This is a good movie for women.  It stirs every emotion.  The friendships between these women are inspiring.  I've watched it a few times over the years and have enjoyed it every time. This is a must see Christmas movie.  There are too many jaded people in this world.  This movie reminds us of how it should be.  If you leave your cynicism at the door, you will love this movie.  Make it a family night! Loved this movie.  Bought it for my 18 year old, who was too young to see it as a new release.  He loved it!  Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery are two fantastic actors whose appeal never ages! I've purchased many of the BBC series, and have been able to watch most of them with my kids.  This one is definitely not for children.  The ""Vicar"" is obsessed with her own breasts and the opposite sex.  It's pretty typical of American sit-coms and not what I'm looking for in a BBC series. My husband and I loved the first season of Ballykissangel.  The first episode was hysterical!  It's quite a crew of characters and imaginative plots.  We loved them so much we ordered seasons 2 and 3. I love Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis.  This movie was great fun and typical Tim Allen.  I liked the neighborhood dynamics.  There were differences but they all pulled together to help each other.  I grew up in a neighborhood like that. I love Midsomer Murders, Miss Marple, Rosemary & Thyme... so I ordered this one. It's very slow moving.  My husband and I have tried to watch a few times, fell asleep every time. I love Helen Hayes and I love Miss Marple Mysteries, but this set was so disappointing.  It reminds me of the typical 80s B rated movies.  Maybe it's because I'm glad the 80s are over, but this series just seemed boring to me. In the beginning this series was enjoyable.  They should have ended it with season three.  The Fifth Season is the worst.  Anthony Michael Hall (or should I say Johnny Smith, not sure which one I'm watching) BELIEVES he's something special. It's become so cliche taking stabs at politicians, religion... ENOUGH!!! I bought this for my 13 year-old son's birthday.  It's one of the few programs on TV he is allowed to watch.  He is anxiously awaiting the new season, hoping it will be as good as past seasons.  This collection is definitely worth buying. I thoroughly enjoy this series.  It's light-hearted, and the scenery...  beautiful! I like the friendship between the two women.  It's appropriate for any age, which is so rare these days.  I'm sick of the ""real life dramas""; television is suppose to be entertaining and that's what this is. This is a great family movie.  I watched the first one with my boys; they loved it so much I had to order the next two.  My husband joined us and we had a fun movie night as a family.  These two make a great team on screen.  If you need a good laugh, get these movies. We enjoyed the first couple of seasons, but they stopped being so entertaining and more... Let's just say the main character became more opinionated and less likable.  The old cast was pretty much replaced with new folks that you don't have time to get comfortable with. We did NOT enjoy this season! I thoroughly enjoy this series.  It's light-hearted, and the scenery...  beautiful! I like the friendship between the two women.

We did NOT enjoy this season! This was another fun, scary and inspiring movie about friends sticking together to fight evil.  The main characters are getting older and their challenges are greater, but they rise to them. I have been a fan of these mysteries since the first episode of the first season.  They're still as good as they were at the beginning.  You can't help but love this partnership. We love this show.  The friendship between the two women is the best part; you want to invite them, literally, into your home and hang out with them.  The plots are interesting and it moves at a good pace. My entire family sits down to watch these together. I liked this version of Robin Hood.  It didn't have the humor that the one with Kevin Costner did, but it had the dignity and strength that Russell Crowe brings to the characters he play.  And that voice... We love this show.  The friendship between the two women is the best part; you want to invite them, literally, into your home and hang out with them.  The plots are interesting and it moves at a good pace. My entire family sits down to watch these together. I love English mysteries; they have more depth than most American mysteries.  I enjoyed watching the relationship between the two main characters develop, especially when Lewis is impatient and grouchy.  James, his subordinate, has a quiet and thoughtful demeanor.  It's a good match. I have enjoyed all series of this show until this one.  Every single episode revolved around religious fanatics.  As fanatical as the characters in these episodes were about different religions, the writers were as fanatical in their contempt for people of faith... any faith.  It's become cliche!. I loved Midsomer Murders and looked forward to every season, but this is the last I will purchase. I really enjoyed this actor and the way he portrayed a young Morse.  I'd been watching the Morse series with John Thaw and was so sad that it ended.  I was thrilled to find this.  Shaun Evans makes a great young Morse.  I wish they'd make more with him in them. My entire family is hooked on this show.  These folks (the characters the actors portray) with all their idiosyncracies make a great team.  The writers do a great job coming up with new plots for each episode and the insight into each of the characters on a personal level adds to the great stories. I love Midsomer Murders, Miss Marple, Rosemary & Thyme... so I ordered this one. It's very slow moving.  My husband and I have tried to watch a few times, fell asleep every time. This is such a great show.  Initially we thought too old fashioned and a bit sedate, but by the end of the first episode we were hooked.  This is a very entertaining series.  You will love the characters and wish there was another season.  We highly recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2MNMZMM6BGLTA," This was a pretty good and pretty funny blaxploitation film. Issac Hayes was really good and there is a lot of cussin' and wild funny violence. Lots of cool lookin' pimps and ho's too. Nothing like a good Friday The 13th movie. What could be better than mixing stupid teens lots of sex and nudity and gory murder by a serial killer all rolled into one. This movie was kind of funny to watch and the boobs and nudity were excellent but it was still the same tired old Friday the 13th saga. Enjoy it. Have fun with it but... don't stay at that summer camp... EVER! This movie is very very good. It has a very interesting premise. Redford is a CIA analyst who reads. He reads everything in print looking for codes or messages. He unwittingly uncovers and becomes a part of a conspiracy that he has to try to decipher while trying to stay alive. GREAT FLICK! Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, and Max von Sydow are great! This movie does something that very few 'Teen' or 'Brat Pack' movies do today... it still holds up. This is a sweet touching movie that hits all the right buttons in the heart department but still remains funny to this day. Cusak proves in one of his early roles why he is still popular and a sought after actor today, the guy is GOOD. I just watched Aquirre the Wrath of God. I had heard a lot about it. I found Klaus Kinski to be mesmorizing. He was spectacular. The story itself was a very honest and uncompromising saga and period piece. I thought that Werner Herzogs directing was visually stunning and that the final scene on the raft was compelling. This movie is not for everyone but I would have to say dittos to those who have deemed it a classic. This movie is entertaining as hell. It is a good 70's action movie. The cast is great and Bronson is at his best in his scenes with Paul Koslo and Al Lettieri. I love when he smashes big Al in the mouth in the diner! Classic! I really enjoyed this movie from Perry Como's 'Christmas Dream' at the beginning to the end. The only problem I had with it was the implausible part where Jon Voight gets a grey wig and moustache and is suppose to be much older and infiltrating The Odessa. But if you suspend disbelief during this part I think you will like the movie. Very intriguing. This movie is just plain excellent. From top to bottom. The acting, direction, soundtrack, costumes and cinematography are just tops. The story is very interesting and the characters are rich and explored wonderfully. It is well balanced and done so well that I can only say check it out. This movie was one of the most brutal Bronson movies ever. The torture scene alone was disturbing as hell. Bronson is a professional who is hired to stop a torturer for hire. It is again a brutal movie and it is only Bronson that can stop it. A good Bronson movie but not for everybody. Just watched this for the first time since the late 70's. I must say the movie still holds up. It is a low budget flick but it is done really well and for what it is it is pretty damn good and entertaining still. And I must say it beats out the slick hollywood remake by a mile. I wanted to like this movie. It stars two of my favorites Naomi Watts and Clive Owen. It has an interesting concept and it just... misses. The acting is good but it seems to get sidetracked and just doesn't hold you nor does it pay off in the end. It is just missing something and I think that the story just goes awry. Also it has some ridiculous action sequence that is totally unbelievable and not needed at all. This is a pretty good movie for the time and the budget. This is Russell Crowe before he was 'RUSSELL CROWE'. He gives a great performance as a dedicated skinhead/white supremacist. If you liked movies like American History X this is a good companion piece. It is pretty violent so not for everybody. I liked this movie thru out the entire time... up until the end. I won't give it away or add any spoilers but Harvey Keitel was perfect in the part of the 'deprogrammer' and Kate Winslet was very good as the 'brainwashed' cultist. I also liked the Neil Diamond music and how it was used in the movie.  Its not a bad flick and it has a good message but boy they blew it in the end. When I heard that Ed Norton, Deniro and Brando were going to make a movie together I was very happy. But I must say that when it came out... Well the performances are very good but the story was predictable and only ok. Its worth watching but not a classic by any means. Small minded people will not like this instant classic. Shot backwards in time this movie will really befuddle and confuse those of us who cannot grasp anything past Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sixteen Candles. Guy Pierce is a shooting star in this business. The story is new, interesting and compelling. Its like putting together a puzzle. GREAT FLICK! GREAT CONCEPT! This movie is so dumb... ""HOW DUMB IS IT?"" This movie is so dumb that even though it has a bunch of hot chicks dancing around in sexy clothes provocatively it is anything but sexy and provocative. Dumb, Dumb, DUMB.  Did I mention that it stunk too. This show was really good at first. The early episodes including the pilot were top notch. Then it kind of got off into the goofy 70's Bigfoot genre and came off the rails. But its got a great cast and Lee Majors was the man! This was far and above better than the Adam Sandler piece of crap. It is definitely a remake of the Burt Reynolds movie. Fun to see Vinnie Jones not play the ugly mean scarey guy. I thought Stathams character was a little too over the top and that is the only thing I didn't like. It was an ok movie. Not great. Not as good as the original but still worth a watch. I liked this movie and everytime I watch it I catch something that makes me laugh. Bill Murray was great as Steve Zissou the burnt out Jaques Cousteau like adventurer. I didn't care for Owen Wilson and his crappy southern accent. If you liked Rushmore and Royal Tennenbaums you will like this movie. Bill Murray is dead pan, dray and hilarious. I thought this was a pretty good western but I must say after all the hype and the reviews I had heard and read I think it was a bit overrated. Crowe and Bale give a good performance. I think that Peter Fonda is and always will be a very overrated actor. Good fun and again a pretty good modern western but not a GREAT movie. This movie stunk. It was full of time travel and all the twist and turns that come with the possibilities. But of course we have seen it all before a million times (can you say 12 Monkey's?). The movie has a great cast and it is a shame to see Denzel, Jesus Caviezel and Val 'I am washed up and not even trying anymore' Kilmer wasted in this stinky doo doo. I am not a big Will Smith fan but I must say I thought this movie was pretty good. I enjoyed the action and the concept (and yes I saw it already in Omega Man with Charlton Heston). The movie was well done and the CGI was pretty good. I liked the build up to the zombies and also the flashbacks weren't too annoying. Also loved the man dog friendship and how it was portrayed. This movie is action packed and entertaining. I must say though that I never saw the cartoon or followed it. I think it would be a good flick to take your teen kids and under too but I found it to be more of a kid movie. That is not bad it is not bad or an insult. It just wasn't for me. I love this movie. First it is a time capsule that really takes me back to when I was a kid in the late 60's. Secondly, I sold insurance door to door for a year and worked other sales jobs and this movie is dead on. The character study is fantastic and I just enjoyed every minute of it. It holds up to any fictional movie. Great stuff. This movie wasn't like anything I had ever seen. I liked that it was different and challenging. A movie like this just shows you that there are new and fresh ideas out there if Hollywood would just stop making sequel after sequel and rehashing of old TV shows. This is an excellent character study. Lots of dialogue and lots of great... GREAT acting. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves great acting. I have watched it over and over. The best part of this movie is Kate Hudson in a bikini and the other little chick in a bikini. The rest is pure garbage. This is the kind of garbage that McConaughey and Hudson will churn out over and over and over even though neither can act. This movie is sToOpId. Affleck and Lopez are overexposed and untalented and it shows in this tribute to their 'true love'. BLECK! God love Hollywood for producing this junk and exposing the shear lack of acting ability of both of these... celebrities (calling them actors is an insult to anybody who ever played a tree in their kindergarten play). This is an excellent companion piece for the movie The Good Sheperd and also for The Company with Alfred Molina and Michael Keaton. It it dead on about the Angleton mole hunt and the CIA and how it crippled this countries intelligence agencies.  Great stuff! I thought this was an interesting presentation of a pretty interesting concept. But the movie is fatally flawed. It is just plain boring and not compelling at all. Nicole Kidman is a very good actress but the movie has a weird vibe to it that just doesn't really ring true. I felt like I was watching somebodys vision of what and how people act but the persons view just seems like bunk and unreal. Never even knew this movie existed. I watched it with three buddies who knew nothing of Man-Thing. They all thought it was pretty good. I didn't think it was a bad movie. I bought it for $1.26 and I thought it was not bad. Not GREAT! but not bad. This movie was ok. Just ok. It had some yucks in it but it wasn't a great comedy. Worth a watch but I don't think it is a repeater like 40 Year Old Virgin or Wedding Crashers. The Ferrigno stuff was mildly funny and Jamie Presly is hot as usual. Favreau was kind of wasted and didn't really do much of anything. Sarah Marshal was better. This is an excellent documentary about the women who were the pioneers of lady professional wrestling. It is an interesting story and tells about their struggles against sexism and against each other in a cruel and dirty business. Great interviews with the ladies as they are today in their mid 60's, 70's and above mixed with wonderful clips of them as young ladies in their prime.  You don't have to be a wrestling fan to like this great documentary. This show was really good at first. The early episodes including the pilot were top notch. Then it kind of got off into the goofy 70's Bigfoot genre and came off the rails. But its got a great cast and Lee Majors was the man! This has become my favorite show. My one joy in life lately is watching Spencer Nolan Rice be humiliated time and again. I generally find each one of these shows to have at least one or two 'OH MY GOD' moments and or laugh out loud moments that I have to tell somebody about or show them.  It is crude, mean spirited and hilarious. This movie was funny to me even though I wasn't sure it was suppose to be. Anyway, any movie that makes a pimp into a sympathetic character has got to be kind of funny... only in Hollywood. Watching this scumbag trying to make it in the hip hop world was pretty funny for some reason. But all in all I had no sympathy for him. But in this day and age ""Pimpin' ain't easy."" This was better than a lot of the big budget action movies that are put out today in the theaters. I think Dolph is like Charles Bronson. He makes good solid action stuff overseas and though he is older he is just getting better. I thought this was a very good and very well done movie. The acting was very good and the docudrama style was very good. Also it was very informative and shed a lot of light on that day. That all being said, I don't really ever want to watch it again. Too soon, too many memories and too much sadness. But I am glad it was done and done so well. It is a story that needed told. This is not a horrible movie. Where it misses is where Roadhouse hit. The origional was so stupid and so goofey that it was actually hilarious in its 'badness'. This movie is just an ok straight to DVD movie.  It is worth a watch if you might be a fan of the origional but it is hardly in its (the origionals) class. It is just not stupid enough. This movie just missed. The car chases, the concept and the casting were all very good. The only thing that got in the way was that babbling Daffy Duck of a director channeling his endless babble into the movie. It was just too much and too long and just babble babble babble. When they finally got down to the nitty gritty it was good.  Daffy... er... Quentin?... SHUT THE HELL UP!  ps Kurt Russell was great as Stuntman Mike!!! Just finished watching this season. I must have missed several episodes cause there was a lot that I hadn't seen that made me about pee my pants. Love this season. Just great! If you are a fan you will love it. If you aren't you will love it. Jim, Pam, Roy... just great stuff. And of course the whole damn cast is just great. I love it. I enjoyed this show very much. The DVD is excellent and the suspense of the show is unbelievable mostly because it is REAL. It is very informative and it pulls no punches. You don't have to know anything about mountain climbing (me included) to find this to be an unbelievably interesting, entertaining, thrilling and compelling show. If I could I would rate this movie less than one. I thought that this was just a really bad movie. I can see why it didn't do well at the theater and I can't even imagine why anybody would even want to see it, yet alone make it into a film. I heard that it was a best seller. I never read the book but I saw the movie and found it to be... STUPID. Nobody does white trash like Rob Zombie does white trash. The guy just has an eye for it. He knows how to pick the perfect cast and how to make their 'trashiness' funny. This was a pretty entertaining movie on its own but comparing it to the origional? I gotta go with John Carpenters version. It was just chilling. This movie was more a Rob Zombie 'Devils Rejects' kind of white trash exploitation movie. This movie was full of some very funny and very crude chuckles. It was just full of hot young naked women. I mean about every two seconds there was a young good looking naked chick.  So if you like crude humor and you like naked women... this is for you.  MASSIVE MASSIVE amounts of nudity. I enjoyed this movie though it was gut wrenching and had some really brutal moments that stick with you. Bale is excellent and so is suprisingly Steve Zahn (in this type of movie). Werner Herzog is a God and he does a GREAT job... again! Richard Gere has had two really good movie this past year. One was The Hoax, which I recommend and the other, this movie, The Hunting Party. The subject is really interesting and the acting was very good too. I enjoyed every bit of this movie. It also has many funny moments in it though it is a very intense and serious subject.  I recommend it to everybody. I thought this movie was just hilarious. I didn't find it to be this awe inspiring thought provoking flick. I just liked it and found the dialogue and characters to be really hilarious. Ellen Page is great. This movie was funny. When I saw it was by The Farelly brothers I knew what to expect. They are notorious for their outrageous and crude humor. This movie had all that and made me laugh outloud quite a few times. For what kind of movie it is... it was a good one. I am not reviewing the actual DVD. I have heard bad things about packaging and other things. I am reviewing the movie and it was GREAT and the best movie of the year. No Country For Old Men was good and I really liked it but after seeing There Will Be Blood there is no comparison. Daniel Day Lewis is the finest actor of our time. I really enjoyed this mini series. I thought it was really good and I liked the suprises and the little things they thru in from the movie. I would recommend it to fans and sci fi fans alike. I thought this movie started out really well. The whitty banter between Caine and Jude Law was very entertaining and very funny. But the movie just kind of lost me after a while. It kind of became tired and monotonous.  Worth a watch but not a great movie. I had no expectations from this movie but I must say it was a pretty enjoyable little movie. It wasn't fantastic and it was ultra hilarious but it was good. I would recommend it. Carolla is a funny guy and his sense of humor is all over this movie. Pretty good feel good sports movie on top of the laughs. I really enjoyed this movie. I liked the story and the atmosphere of 1950's culture. Leo and Kate were excellent as were the rest of the cast. The crazy guy from 'Bug' (with Ashley Judd) steals the entire show playing the crazy son of Kathy Bates. He is hilarious! Good movie. This movie is very well acted but I must say it was very disturbing more so because it is based on a true story. It is shocking in its portrayal of how cruel human beings can be to another human being.  This movie is not for everybody and I will say that it left a lasting and very disturbing impression on me.

I thought this was an excellent film. Great dialogue and great performances. I lived thru the times that are the subject of this movie and have seen the interviews when they first came out. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and thought it was an excellent concept and that it was superior film making. This was a pretty good, funny, black comedy. Good acting all the way around which is suprising since one of the actors is Colin Farrell who usually plays everything exactly the same way and makes some pretty crappy movies. I liked it. They hit a homerun on this one. The casting is fantastic. The story is great and they give it enough room to be its own movie with its own reality for a new story and for future new stories. I loved it. Chris Pine was Kirk! Two thumbs up! I thought this movie was pretty good. It is old school humor but it has a few yucks in there. Clooney is always good but this movie misses as compared to some of his better comedy roles. I still enjoyed it and think that it will get over with most. It just wasn't great. I thought this was a very good movie. I like the way it was shot. Sometimes it almost had a documentary type feel to it. All the actors were excellent and it was a very interesting story that I knew very little about. I liked this movie. Based on a true story it has good acting, a good story, action and also some very moving moments. Liev and Daniel Craig are both excellent. Not a great movie but it is pretty darn good. Lots of violence so not for kids but I think both men and women would like it. After seeing the trailer and seeing that Nicholas Cage was the star I thought ""here we go again"". I think he is a very overrated actor who has really put out some garbage lately. That said, this movie was not that bad and kept my interest. Cage was not bad in it. This movie was pretty good but not as good as I thought it would be. It had some funny lines and take offs on Viet Nam genre and a heck of a cast. Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise stole the show totally. Ben Stiller was ok but just ok like he is in most of his movies.  The movie was pretty good but not the over the top laugh fest I thought it would be. This movie was bad in a good way. It was pretty fun. The best parts were Bruce being the Bruce Campbell character. Not for everybody but if  you are a fan of Bruce and his crappy movies you will like this. Worth every penny of the $14.95 I spent. The animation was very good. The stories were very good and it was everything that I want in a Marvel super hero animated movie(s).  Get it. You won't regret it. Worth every penny of the $14.95 I spent. The animation was very good. The stories were very good and it was everything that I want in a Marvel super hero animated movie(s).  Get it. You won't regret it. This movie was just not that good. It just didn't come together and it just didn't work. It had some really crude stuff and some of it even gave me a chuckle here and there but this movie was a miss. This is about the worst movie I have ever seen. It was completely idiotic and not in the least bit scary. They tried to make up for how horrible it was by throwing in a ton of over the top gore and all this did was cement that it was a childish, immature piece of dung. This movie was really good. The only bad part is the piece of wood known as Ben Affleck. Still I enjoyed all of it and all of its twists. Russell Crowe picks good projects. I like watching Jessica Biel naked. But Jessica it's Go Go not... cry cry. Forrest Whitaker irritated the excrement out of me. Jessica Biel is not a good actress but the story with her and Ray Liotta was semi interesting. But still this movie blows... except for Jessica Biel stripping and being naked, something that most hollywood actress's who play strippers can't seem to figure out (strippers take their clothes off). This movie has its moments. It is very dark and kind of disturbing. In that it is different than a lot of these screwball comedies. That said, it is just ok. Worth a peek but nothing I would rewatch. Clifton Collins Jr stands out in the movie. It is a nice little film but nothing great. Alan Arkin is a favorite of mine and his role is a bit blah. The two girls are good but again just nothing outstanding. It is kind of depressing too. This movie was just a piece of poop. And the block head steroidal Frankenstien looking piece of wood that is the leading man makes the pile of poop 10 times more stinky. This ain't the 80's and this mongoloid makes Arnold, Sly and even Dolph Lundgren look like DeNiro. Fat Val gets a payday and stoops to working with bucktoothed non acting Fitty Cent. Sharon Stone still looks good but doesn't have much to do. This movie is really crappy. The story of corruption in New Orleans and the post Katrina atmosphere would be a good backdrop for a story but this is garbage. This movie was good but it was cofusing with all the jumps back in time and all the twists and turns. In the end it paid off. I like Clive and Julia Roberts together, a little 'Closer' reunion. Pretty good flick also some funny moments too. Garbage. This is just garbage. You know Hollywood has given up when they name a title the same as the original and just drop the 'The'. The first one was a piece of crap and this one is its equal if not worse. Dumb dumb dumb. Put a nail in the coffin of this dead stupid corpse PLEASE. This movie was kind of like 'Dazed and Confused' light. It was ok. Kristen Stewart is the stand out and Ryan Reynolds is like dog poop in that he is in everything and I believe I have seen him play this kind of part before. Still a nice little movie with some yucks. Some of the late 80's themes made me chuckle quite a bit. This movie really didn't scare me but it was funny and a fun flick to watch. It took me a while to realize this is the chick from Matchstick Men. All it all I had a good time watching it. I liked this movie a lot. All the characters were excellent and the movie was just full of suspense and thrills. I recommend it and watched it with about 6 or 7 friends, guys and gals, and they all liked it. Timothy Olyphant stood. This was pretty funny but it was just the same old formula chick flick I have seen a million times. I knew as soon as I started watching it that it was written by a woman. It wasn't bad just the same old by the numbers chick flick with some crude humor for the guys and Sex and the City ladies. Desiree Cousteau shines as the bubble headed Peaches of the title. This movie is pretty funny for an adult movie. Cousteau stands out in her role above all others in the movie. She is ditzy and an amesiac who gets into some precarious positions and finds herself looking for her identity and for her family. I loved this DVD package. It was great. I love seeing the interviews mixed in with the old footage and stories of my beloved DALLAS COWBOYS. It was GREAT to see Dandy Don and his buddy Pete Gent and hearing them talk about The Cowboys as well as all the other greats.  If you are a COWBOY fan and don't have this... shame on you.  HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!!!! They hit a homerun on this one. The casting is fantastic. The story is great and they give it enough room to be its own movie with its own reality for a new story and for future new stories. I loved it. Chris Pine was Kirk! Two thumbs up! This was a good movie and there was some real chemisty between Milla and her awkward nerdy leading man who has a good heart but keeps putting his foot in his mouth. Baldwin and Denise Richards are an after thought and could have been played by anybody. Milla is the star and is perfect in this kind of role. This movie should have been released in the theaters in the states. She is a sweety.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AD81H63G30R01," A classic amazing film with both unforgettiable comedy and drama. Dolly Parton, Sally Field and Julia Roberts really pull off the classic act. The film is both very funny but also very touching as you see how strong women really are. Its a classic and a must have for all women. The first one was awesome. Feautring legendary pokemon Mew and Mewtwo. Many pokemon appear in this as Mewtwo clones many. Including Ash's Pikachu, Charizard, Bulbasaur and Squritle. Misty's Pysduck and Brock's Vulpix too. Other pokemon appear such as Team Rocket's Meowth, Venasaur, Blastoes, Vaporeon, Gyaradose, Ninetails, Rabidash, Wigglytuff, Rhyhorn, Pidgiot, Dewgong, Syther, Nidoqueen, and so on. Plus the bonus pokemon short is totally awesome. The film is no different from the book. The Plague dogs has beautiful graphics and eerie feelings. The songs are so sad it sends a chill down your spine. If a person watched it and didn't shed one tear, they are heartless. This was a great movie! It evn has a Luckdragon who flys and is white! He's nice as an angel! I think he's my favorite! Anyhow the music is AWESOME! And I love the actors!    Watch as it becomes your own story! VERY intense movie. Even non-Anime fans will enjoy it. A true classic in its time, Akira is extremely intense, violent and has a very complex story behind it. A MUST HAVE for any Anime collection. NOT for kids! And not for people who are too bible sensitive. This movie is funny, awesome and unforgettable. Tim Allen plays as a man who hates Christmas, but ends up accidently killing Santa Clause, thus forcing him to become the new Santa Clause.  Between the comical head elf Bernard and the magical adaption of the North Pole, it is a family classic. A cute and amazing film with great music and animation. Focusing on a tiny cute kitten Oliver and a pack of hilarious stray dogs. Dodger, the wire fox terrier is my personal fav. Full of love and humor plus action. This classic will live on. This is such a FUNNY movie!!!! I LOVE the part when Rocky beats up Slappy and says ""Never go against the family"". That was just TOO funny! I LOVED the part when Slappy is chasing the kids to the livingroom and when the one kid opens the recliner chair and when it opens it hits Slappy and he goes flying!!! This movie is SOOOOO funny!    Do buy it! Classic flick. More funny than scary. One of the best horror films I've seen in a long while! A bit disgusting, gory and strange, but it has such a witty plot you got to watch it! Bought it for Halloween, both my mother and uncle enjoyed it very much. I don't understand why there is so much hate for this movie! What is WRONG with people!? It's a GREAT movie and I love the plot and idea of it being about Ariel's daughter. We don't see movies like that anymore. Don't listen to the haters, your kids will LOVE this movie. My top favorite pokemon movie that stars my top favorite Pokemon of them all! Entei is so awesome in this film. This film has an amazing plot and is so worth the money. This could be one of my favorite animal movies!  In fact it is!!!! It's such a GREAT movie! I love how they made it! The music is GRAND!!!!!    Do buy it!!!! This movie is so COOL! About this Border Terrier named Hubble and 4 earth dogs named Shep a Bernese Mountain dog, Nelly, Willson a Boxer, and a poodle. And the dogs talk! And theres also a black or gray (Can't tell which) Great Dane.    It's SOOOO Cute and funny!    DO buy it! It is a good film, featuring legendary pokemon Jirachi, a pokemon who can teleport and grant wishes, Absol, a pokemon who will only appear to warn of great tragedy. Plus a Groudon. But it could have been slightly better. It is not one of my top favs, but I like it. The main thing I love is the song at the credits ""Make a Wish"" which is very beautiful. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE and LOVVVVEEEE this movie!!!!!!!  It's SOOOOOOOOOOOOO cute!!!!! It's about a dog named Winn-Dixie and his new owner. I even read the book! I have this because of winn-dixie movie on DVD! I LOVE it!    Do buy it!    It's worth your money! I have always loved the Air Bud series, but the fifth one was a bit off. But when this came out, I LOVED it! Airbuddies is so much better. The puppies talk and have a cute personailty! Highly worth it! Being a huge fan of Wallace and Gromit, and also Chicken run, I really expected better of this. I consider this the worst film those creators ever did. It's shameful, has a boring plot, its easy to full asleep too and they try to make it entertaining with catchy songs but in the end they fail.  It feels like the film is holding back its true charm somehow. But it's also NOT for people who are terrified of dolls. This film has a good balanced amount of gore, jumpscares and suspense. It has an eerie gray theme and also is truly terrifying. Also has a twist ending. It deserves a sequel or even a prequel going deeper into Mary Shaw's life. Roseanne is without a doubt my most favorite Sitcom. It's funny, LONG and also had scenes that can be dramatic and serious, balancing it perfectly. We see Roseanne and Dan go through some crazy parenting to three kids. Nice Becky, rebel Darlene and funny DJ.  It's a must have, plus it shows many Christmas, Thanksgiving and Halloween specials.

We see Roseanne and Dan go through some crazy parenting to three kids. Nice Becky, rebel Darlene and funny DJ.  It's a must have, plus it shows many Christmas, Thanksgiving and Halloween specials. My top favorite pixer film, Bolt is the best! About a cute but confused movie star dog who thinks everything he films is real. The sweet relationship between Bolt and Penny is so cute too!!! Highly worth the money! This is amazing! I had got this for Christmas and the picture and sound is perfect! If you are a huge anime fan like me, then I highly recomand it. Kanon has an amazing super natuarl plot that takes you back in time to a promise. Another beautiful anime from Key! Really INTENSE adaption! This time Harry, Ron and Hermione are not going back to Hogwarts. They search for the remaining Horcruxes, pieces of Voldemort's soul and set out to destroy him. The part one of the ultimate climax is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.  It is very intense, dark, suspenseful and we see some old faces like Umbridge, Dobby, Kreacher, Fleur, Griphook, etc. We also meet new faces like Bill Weasley and Scabior. I have always been a huge fan of the Buddies movie. More than the original Air Bud series. This one though is so far my top fav. It really explains the true meaning of Christmas. Plus the cuteness between Puppy Paws and the buddies is great humor. The cute stray puppy Tiny in the pound also sings a short beautiful song ""A Christmas Miracle"" and it brings tears to your eyes. Highly worth the price! I am a Twilight fan but I think this was hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing through it. Some of the craziest stuff happens, Charlie with the blow up doll was so funny and just little i guess additional Easter eggs. Like the people going to see ""Breaking dawn part 1"" in the theater. It's really funny...I don't know if every Twilight fan will enjoy it like I did, but the haters will have a field day with it. I am a huge fan of pokemon and love the movies from 1 to 9. The tenth one wasn't too great and the 11th was OK, but this one was awful. It dragged out and had a boring plot. This movie is extremely heart warming and good! Plus the fact it's a true story makes it even better! When a Dolphin's tail gets injured by a crab trap and has to be removed, the people seek help from a doctor (Morgan Freeman) to make her a brace tail so she can swim properly. There's drama, humor and it's truly an amazing movie! After Tim Burton's disappointing version, I was not expecting this to be any good. But this is AMAZING. The CG is INCREDIBLE, the acting is Oscar worthy and the drama and story keeps you hooked.  Totally worth buying, and it completely makes up for Tim Burton's version. Ice Age adds another epic adventure involving the so easily loved characters. Ice Age never disappointed me and may never will. The characters are so intensely loveable, and the plots are always amazing.  Each Ice age seems to get better and better, and I am crossing my fingers for a fifth This movie was simply the most heartwarming film I've seen in a long time. The plot was very well written and it was just beautiful. When I first heard of the movie's plot, I was on edge to watch it because I thought that in the end Duke would end up dying, since it seemed to have that type of tone.  But rest assured, Duke LIVES! And it is just a wonderful movie for any animal lover. Anyone who can watch this documentary and still go to Seaworld is EVIL and HEARTLESS! This documentary couldn't be more exposing, true and powerful. I watched this myself on its premiere on CNN last Christmas. PLEASE BUY THIS! Everyone and even everyone's children need to be educated of how Seaworld REALLY works! This is a no Bull**** anime! It's got action, drama, suspense, everything! The plot is amazing, the characters are awesome and it really keeps you on the edge of your seat, wanting to see what happens next!  This is sheer brilliance! Cannot wait for Season 2 to be released! Really enjoyed this one! I was worried it would suck since after a series does so many sequels, they lose their touch, but it surprised me. This is every enjoyable, fun and very cute. And it's nothing like Beethoven's 4th, I don't understand why a reviewer said this. Great for kids or animal lovers of all ages This was one of the most GREATEST Goosebump movies I ever saw!!!!!! It was very funny too. All the acting was GREAT!   This one was almost as good as ""The Haunted Mask""!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1O60Q7LBN4MQ," I couldn't get myself too far into the book but this was great. I think Jared Diamond's theory makes a lot of sense. About geography being why some people became ahead of the rest of the world in technology. I wasn't bored at all. It's a lively presentation and has great scenery from all over the world. This will be something I'll be thinking about for awhile. It's very intriguing. A movie version of Ray Bradbury novel of a restristed society that banned books ""for our own good"". People are given drugs to make them feel good all the time (like Prozac and other drugs now).  It's an excellent movie and considering where we seem to be heading, a timely movie to watch.  BTW, I found it interesting that a TV called a ""Wallscreen"" looks identical to today's HDTVs! High school mismatched couple drift away after high school in 1967. She's a nice Jewish girl who went to collage. He's an Italian boy who goes to Florida to lip-synch to Sinatra (his ""hero"") songs in a club. But they still think of each other often.  It was okay. I like the 60s and Springsteen music. The plot and acting was just fair but not a bad film to waste time watching. I thought this was very well made. Little special effects was needed due to a great plot, script and acting. The music was good for setting the mood for this chilling tale. Laura San Giacomo deserved accolades for her performance as Nadine Cross, the one Randell Flagg chose for his lover. It was silly and goofy as expected. I actually laughed a few times. I got this movie because I read that it was funny and it was. Not rolling on the floor tears coming down my face funny but funny enough. I'll never will be a big fan of either Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell but they did okay this time. I wish I started watching this when it came out. I watched the whole series over the weekend and was mesmerized. The cast, the writing and character development is great. This is one of the best series on TV in the last 10 years. I'll have to wait awhile to catch up on it but I'm looking forward to it. Phoenix seemed to have Johnny Cash's mannerisms down perfect. And his singing is wonderful! Witherspoon proved she can do more than play a ditzy blonde. And she too can sing very well.  I couldn't believe that the film is 135 minutes because I was so immersed in the movie time seemed to disappear. You don't have to be a country music or Cash fan to enjoy this movie. This is for anyone who loves good movies. It was interesting to watch how these people survived in such appalling conditions. I think they lied to themselves to deal with it (as the end of the film tends to prove my belief) but I admired their fortitude. Nobody should have to live in such a bleak environment. It was interesting to watch how these people survived in such appalling conditions. I think they lied to themselves to deal with it (as the end of the film tends to prove my belief) but I admired their fortitude. Nobody should have to live in such a bleak environment. It sounded interesting. A women seeks revenge on an abusive boyfriend. But I only liked the last 20 or 30 minutes when she was giving him and her mean father their just dues. Why? Because the plot was weak and the acting wasn't very good. Thankfully, it wasn't too long. This was a good movie. It's a simple story about a old man who collects butterflies. There is a reason why that you find out at the end of the movie. He meets a little girl who evolves from a thorn in his side to someone he lets enter his life.  It's a simple sweet story with beautiful scenery. It reminds me of my beloved Colorado mountains. This movie was at times hard to watch. A pregnant woman being a mule. How horrifying! I have neighbors who complain about the immigrants coming here, but can you blame them for wanting a better life in America? It's so hard in this stupid world. We just don't appreciate how much better we have it. Besides, all of us in the United States are descendants of immigrants, unless you are one of the few Native Americans left. This film was a total bore. Not because it was in black and white to look like it was made in the '30s. It was boring because of the lackluster script and acting. Just because something is ""unique"", and that it is, doesn't make it great. It makes a uniquely boring movie.  Stay away. If I meet anyone that prattles on what a wonderful movie this is I will know I'm in the presence of a pretentious snob. With all the well known great actors in this film, I expected better. It seemed like an overlong, overblown Twilight Zone episode. I guessed the ending when the Ivy's father shown what was in the shed he taken her to. All ""style"" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The ""Entertainer"" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over. I thought by the cover that this foreign film was a comedy. It was a sick movie and was disappointed. Unless over the top violence is your thing, I highly suggest staying away from this film. It was a good story with lots of action. I found myself wondering if such brutality exists and realized it probably does somewhere. Maybe here in the USA. Humans are are capable of great acts good and evil. Jet Li was very good in this. I've never heard of him before but I hope he does other movies. Morgan Freeman was his usual fantastic self. Because of her job, a woman is being forced to make a call to set up an assassination against her will on a plane. The best part of this movie is when they land. Then it becomes very tense! To me, it seemed more like a very well done made-for-TV movie than a theatrical release. I do recommend this but you may want to wait until it comes on TV. I found him mildly funny. I wouldn't pay to see him but okay for a little over an hour on DVD.  I found his ""gal in the audience"" commentary in sotto voce annoying. But his fans seem to like it.  Not much to say about the performance. Maybe I'm just hard to please in my old age. I enjoyed it but I wish they wouldn't make movies so long. Two hours is long enough. And I have to admit I liked the kids better when they were younger. I really liked the first Harry Potter. Of course the special effects is great. Don't have a lot to say one this one, except it was fun and J.K. Rowling writing talents is truly amazing. What an imagination! I don't cry watching movies often but seeing these hostage passingers saying goodbye to the loved ones on their cellphones was heartbreaking. This movie brought back all the emotions I felt on that day. We must make sure something like this never happens again! Pretty predictable and dull. I found it hard to feel for Huard because he had a bad attitude. If you can't take orders, you do not belong in the armed forces. I liked his roommate ""Arkansas"" Nance better because he had heart. Still, none of the characters or the plot grabbed my attention. Strong acting from Samuel L. Jackson and Julianne Moore plus good writing keeps this movie interesting. Otherwise it's just another rip-off from the news. No surprises in this film but thanks to Jackson and Moore you could feel for Moore's character Brenda Martin.  I can only recommend this because these two fine performers make this fresh and somewhat believable. This is a very powerful documentary. It still gives me chills to watch the first tower go down and to see people jumping out of the building. This is non-political film. No finger pointing that it was Clinton's fault or Bush's fault. It was both. The FAA Security could also have prevented this tragedy.  No one wanted to be responsible or be accountable.  Highly worth seeing. A little 1984 (George Orwell) and the real politics of today (terrorism, possible germ warfare) with imagination what the future could hold. I was enthralled and I can't help but think if I was British I would appreciate this movie more.  We must be vigilant and not allow the government to get away with anything. No matter what political affiliation you have, we must keep checks in place so nothing near this can happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2PL5TVNOIQE1W," I actually got tow of these DVDs and the 1st one had a defect on the Dragonheart side. I didn't realize at the time I purchased it that I was getting 2 films on one DVD. I called and got a replacement DVD the night I got the one with the flaw on it. All was taken care of by Amazon quickly and professionally. Love getting my films from Amazon. I would say the same thing about this movie that I said about Emma. I usually get films because of the cast. I didn't dislike it -- it was just okay. Tom Hardy was only 25 when he did this film and every second he was on screen he was magnificent. It should have started a great career as an actor, but all good things come in time. I found this film very well performed by the actors  Given what happened to her mother in that era, I can understand how she treated the two Roberts in her life. I am not as well read on her life as the other reviewers I do know when I like a film, and I really liked this one. This is a really good TV movie and the whole cast did a brilliant job. Of course I love watching anything Tom Hardy is in, but even if he hadn't been in Colditz I would have loved it. Jane Austen had a look of self confidence to have written for a living when at that time the only job most women had was becoming a wife. Well acted all the way through. It's a pretty good film, but I bought it because Tom Hardy was in it and it just didn't have enough of him in it. He should have been the lead character. It's a pretty good film, but I bought it because Tom Hardy was in it and it just didn't have enough of him in it. He should have been the lead character. Guy Richie did an excellent job of directing this film. I hadn't seen any of his work before this film. The cast was superb and the direction of their characters was witty and great fun to watch. It is well edited, well shot, the actors in each role are superb and I think the whole thing is done better than any other Wuthering Heights than any other I have seen & I've seen around 5 of them. Never fails to make me cry. Channing's father is one of those character actors that steals the films of some pretty top notch actors. Amanda is like an angel and looks a lot like one in this film, as well as her good deads. Chris Evans and Bryce Dallas Howard are both very good in this movie, but I must say Bryce out acts Chris in nearly every sceen. He is easy on the eyes but isn't the actor Tom Hardy or Ryan Goslin are--he has a way to go. This is actually Karen Woods writing this not my husband Bobby L. I just recently discovered Tom Hardy and only seen a few of his films. His acting ability is on the level of a Russell Crowe, no matter what character Russell is playing he inhabits that role and I find Tom Hardy is making me feel the same about him. I love the director of this film and I loved the story line better in this film. Sir Anthony Hopkins can really turn it on, the tears too. I really enjoyed this film. What a cast, what can I say about the case, every actor in this film is a legion and when you gather those kinds of talent you could only come out with a really good movie. It started a little slow, but once it picked up pace it was brilliant. The story line isn't well written and there are a lot of things in the movie that don't make sense to me because of the way it was edited, but Mr. Hardy looks really good in this film as does Reese so it suits my purposes. The Huntsman--Thor is well acted, I didn't realize what  a good actor Chis is. Charlize is good and the camera likes Kristen a lot in this film. Kristen is much prettier than in the Twilight Saga films, but still lacks a little until she gets to the range of Charlize. Great team of actors to bring this movie to life. I can't stand watching Sean Penn and he proved me right in this film. The good guys on the other hand were great to watch. I stayed up last night and watched this movie. It was cute yet full of action too. I love this series of movies. I wish they would make one more with the whole family in it. This was a great follow-up to RED the original. I mistakenly bought 2 instead of just 1, but since it's the holiday season I will save the extra one as a gift. Nice mistake. Such a touching film about a band of brothers willing to do what few would have done in their places. Glory to their families and our High Power for such men. Sir Anthony Hopkins had a larger part in the first addition of Thor, or just maybe better written or better directed. I'm not sure who did the screenplay or the directing of this one. Don't get me wrong it was entertaining but just didn't quite meet my expectations after seeing the 1st addition. This film hits full on from the beginning all the way to the end. It was delivered promptly and Amazon customer service is always top notch. I saw this film at the theater and was blown away by the quality of acting presented. I look forward to my next movie ""Locke"" which should arrive just after my birthday. A beautiful story, not what I expected at all, but I do love the story. The screenplay was well written and actors like Colin Farrell & Russell Crowe really know how to bring it to life. I got a kick out of how many actors that were in Russell's Robin Hood movie were in this movie as well. They all started in Mystery Alaska.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AZ6BPBC13KWBR," Note my use of ""actress"" as oppose to ""actor"" for a group of supremely talented ladies.  They are ladies and sisters and mothers and aunts, etc. and deserve to be recognized for excellence in their gender which is at very least equal to the opposite gender.  Political correctness in retitling jobs/careers is so inane and to me detracts from this wonderful motion picture as well as from women in general! This was a great movie  when I first saw it years ago and it is even better these many years later.  I seldom watch a film twice.  This one I would watch a third time Jodie Foster was superb as was the entire supporting cast.  The photograpy was ahead of it's time and is as current as today. This was a bit of a surprise!  I expected Science Fiction but got Science Comedy - enjoyed the movie it did get a little silly at times.  It was definitely worth a single viewing. Not what I was expecting this feature turned out to be very entertaining.  It epitomizes sophisticated comedy at it's best.  While the story line may be wholly unrealistic, it does not make any difference.  Simply suspend your disbelief and have a good time.  Douglas and Benning were both excellent. A very good movie on a theme echoed around the world in maby different cultures.  This is a different and interesting take well-acted by Johnny Depp and others.  It features a far less than predictable plot but does leave one guessing some at the end.  The flick was well worth the time spent! My wife and I downloaded this for my grand daughter who then had to go home before being able ti view it.  We decided to view the movie and are glad that we did.  A fun movie that could have had better designed ""creatures,"" was still worth watching. This 3rd remake of the W. Somerset Maughn classic was true to it's genre.  While some might say it is slow moving, the speed of presentation is appropriate to the story.  The director well presented this classic story with superb performances by Ed Norton aand Naomi Watts were perfect in their performances.  Beautiful scenery contrasted against the suffering caused by a deathly,cholera epidemic in China only increased the intensity of the film - a worthy movie!! This 3rd remake of the W.

This light-hearted Christmas story was very good. My wife and I have different, subjective, views of the graphics:  She loved them; I sort of liked them.  Objectively though, this is good family fun and worth the time to view it. When all is said and done, this film is intense, sad and gratifying.  As usual, Denzel Washington is excellent.  Here he is supported by an excellent group of supporting actors and actresses.  In a way, this could be described as a moral story and the ending is appropriate to the story. The performance,the photography, and the sets were splendid.  The only problem, and I do not think this could be avoided, is that the grandiosity of Cirque Du Soleit simply cannot be reproduced effectively on a 2-D, 47"" TV.  To fully realize all of the effects either a live performance or maybe a theater-sized screen in 3D would work. A worthwhile tale of man's unfair brutality towards his fellow man and how some survived.  The only drawback to me is that I have never liked sub-titled movies for reasons that I will not bore you with here. This is mis-classified as a comedy-Drama!  There is nothing funny about it.  It is straight arrow!  The acting is competent.  Adam Sandler does as good a job as can be done with a somewhat lackluster script.  If you just like Adam Sandler and you want to see him doing something very different, watch this.  It is worth some of your time but I would not feel that way if I had paid for it/ My wife and I downloaded this for my grand daughter who then had to go home before being able ti view it.

A1KWJULSTTTBEN," This a classic perfect love story.  There are days that the old movies just can not be beat.  Acting is great and the costumes are fantastic.  Great family movie or chic flick. This is a great family movie to watch any time.  The acting is great and the characters fit the part.  They did a wonderful job with the set and everything.  A movie that warms the heart, I got a DVD player for all regions just so I could play this dvd.  This has some of the most comical story lines ever.  If you love ""Last of the Summer Wine""  series this is a must.  Quiet drink at an old pub- and the canoe ballad two of the most comical stories ever.  The writer and the actors are a perfect fit.  One of the best ever. If you love Brit Comedy -this is great,  wondered how the story line would go without Compo.  Still very funny and they still get into silly trouble.  I love the antic they get into.  love it! If you love Brit Comedy -this is great,  wondered how the story line would go without Compo.  Still very funny and they still get into silly trouble.  I love the antic they get into.  love it! I have this in my own collection and bought this as a gift.  It is the most funny situations in a small English village.  The characters are perfect for the parts and you can pop this in and laugh and laugh.  Such a feel good story. Young love now they meet again and love is still there.  Mixing of two so different families and the stories of bringing together.  A great story can't wait for the second season to come later. Loved the second series and hoping for a third season.  The actors fit the parts and the story is so funny yet serious.  If you loved season one this is a must.  It is even better the story just gets deeper than ever.  A must watch. If you are a Shaun the sheep lover this is the beginning info of the story.  A must watch I watch with my grandson and laugh as much as him.  A great family movie very cute story.  We have watched it several times. One of my favorite British comedy's with the best slams ever.  A gay couple and their neighbors filled with the best one liners.  One to pop in the DVD player when you need to relax and just laugh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2CK1THWGLSA4Q," These robots are like vampires.  They are hunted like us, and they fight to the last.  The only way for peace is to join with the living -- the living and dead together.  This movie shows us the way.  See it, and believe. We are brothers with the undead giant.  This is a false tale that breeds misconceptions about our alliances with other tortured creatures.  The bad film quality only makes the living laugh at us.  I am prevented from giving it a 1 only because our Lord's name is in the title.  Vampires, we must stop these cinematic assaults on our kind!! Two great species bleeding and killing for us, in a ritual game of death.  This, too, is the existence of our undead brothers on all planets.  So, please, filmmaker, give us the honor of knowing the alien and the predator as bretheren, not as evil ones.  We must learn to hate the night no more.  Only then will the bloodletting become painless, and part of the light. Loved the darkness of this version.  Beats the comic book crap of the others.  Bring on the bats, the fear, the secret society of killers.  Batman is one of us, he is a vampire. Raw and from the heart, even from that which is heartless.  This is the one film that makes you feel the starkness of the curse.  The pain of living undead.  Please watch this, so you will have pity upon our kind!  Before we kill you. Satan is our brother, he will come again.  This movie shows how close we are to deliverance.  It was an ample chronicle of what could be.  The dead are rising now, and soon all will be a river of blood and fire.  All vampires should study this film. This is the movie we all saw first, to know that were with the ancient one.  Legosi is our John the Baptist, and one day, there will be no need for fiction -- we will live without fear in the light.  Not in your lifetime, but in mine. These robots are like vampires.

AYTVY9HUAJLYK," This is a great movie about a man who looses his wife to an untimely accident as they work on their life goals together... and then he meets a new love.  Fantastic and totally unrealistic but loving movie! if you're ever down and out or in a bad mood,t his is a great movie to watch.  You can't help but laugh at some of the hijinks the town goes to all in the name of a lottery.  Hilarious, a great bit of craic! A good, heart warming story of an Irish family set during the ""troubles"" in Ireland.  Pierce Brosnan does a so-so irish accent, which is hilarious since he's irish.  Some of the other accents tend to come/go, but the story is fantastic tale of how irish family was changed by the persistence of one man. I watched a number of films on Slavery and this set is by far the best one, the deepest dive and the most far reaching.  It discusses not only how slavery became to be what is now known for, but how it developed from the earliest stages around the globe and grew into the nasty beast it became in america. What i love most about this movie is Terrence Howard.  All the characters come together from different backgrounds and work together to make the thug a success.  The variety of music is fantastic, and the realities of different lifestyles is bluntly displayed.  I get why critics panned this as racist in that the story is essentially a pimp murders someone who offends him only to get famous off his music while in jail. I love this series.  It's set in Hastings, London in pre-war and during WWII.  Foyle's calm demeanor is fantastic as are his sleuth abilities.  I can't believe the season only has 3 episodes! I loved Cranford, and I loved Return to Cranford.  this period piece is set in the 1700 hundreds in a remote village called Cranford.  All the characters have very good parts and roles in their social circle.  You can't wait to the next episode, which is of course why I binge-watched the series...and then bought it.  I love Judi Dench, but there are no weak characters in this series.  And, it's family friendly. I thought this movie would be sci-fi.  It is not at all what you expect.  The adventure is quite good, the suspense is not overdone.  I rented it twice and noticed things in the second showing I missed in the first.  It's a good thriller, but you leave wanting more because you never quite figure out why she has tattoo's and where her story is going.  Fantastic thriller! this is a great set of documentary films and gives great detail and shares some fantastic photos and stories as well as letter reading to bring you into the moment of american history.  Gritty. I loved the movie.  I can't say that I agree with 5 academy awards, but it is a great movie.  Then ten minute ""preview"" had me hooked.  To find out what such a boy endures and then discovers is wonderful.  I only wished the animatron had held some secret more than it did. This movie is about the war, and a horse... but the only pivotal moment is amid the war when it brings people together to help the horse.  Other than that, the movie is anti climactic because so little is spoken.  Pretty horse, great scenes... but not oscar worthy to me. I love this story, but the verbatim dialogue was a struggle to get through at times.  Most of the actors did a good job, but didn't seem to really own the lyrics or their character with exception to Queen and alfrie and Mrs. Huxtable. This is an OK movie, the back story is somewhat lazy and long, by the time you get to the end, you want the story to continue so you know what happens to the friends and the girl.  IT wrapped up much too quickly for me. love this series.  at first it was a bit gritty for me because I had a sanitized, modern view of childbirth.  The series shows the human side of life being born, of the medical profession and among various social groups.  It's a series I'll watch again and again. It's an interesting movie, it's racy and Jude law is nude often and quite vulgar... The perfect character.  Not a movies for young folks .... The ending is a mildly anticlimactic.  Jude has some nice hams though. it starts off a bit cheeky and you wonder who is big jerk is, but the underlying story doesn't arrive til about 30 min into the movie, and then the villain becomes a bit of a protagonist villain. It's a good story, I'm glad I kept watching.  I did love his little sidekick who you think is a hero until his Dad arrives. This is an OK sci movie, with the droids definitely created by males for males and a decidedly male perspective that seems more about male sex slave fantasy gone technologically awry.  A bit predictable and sexist for me. I had never heard of this before and it's a great story,especially with the Interviews of the real people  involved some twenty years later. At times it does smack more of a movie to promote the reality of God vs. the reality of events and seems a little staged bit is a great movie. I even googled the real story, powerful stuff. A great depiction of the housing crisis. Steve carrell plays such a great, cranky business man. all characters are gritty and show you how the wheel of finance finds a way to make money off any situation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3V8J2RSKXUQ0S," every time this movie was on television i would watch it and when i heard Queen Latifah was going to do a remake i was excited until i actually saw it.  Needless to say the original is way better, and shows more emotion; really the funniest actress in this movie is Shirley MacLaine. how can you go wrong with these three comedians. I loved this movie with the exception of its packaging i was expecting a case and got an envelope but other than that no disappointments in this great comedy of friends, family, love, . . . and revenge its one of the ultimate guy movies.  I bought it for my brother and he loved, his friends loved it, and know they have an idea for a Halloween costume and want to take up surfing, which is good for them.  But like I said a total bro movie. this movie was a gift greatly enjoyed by the little one who got it.  The movie made her laugh and sigh and made her light up, which was the best gift for me.  I first saw this movie as a little girl and loved it, i was glad i could give it to her. as i stated i read the book first and then watched the movie and i gotta say i liked the movie more only because the book gave me the happy endings i didn't realize i wanted. in the books the daughters realized their sadness and do nothing to change it while in the movies they learn from their moms and find thier happiness because they know thats what thier moms want from them as i stated i read the book first and then watched the movie and i gotta say i liked the movie more only because the book gave me the happy endings i didn't realize i wanted. in the books the daughters realized their sadness and do nothing to change it while in the movies they learn from their moms and find thier happiness because they know thats what thier moms want from them I have always been a fan of the color and music of Bollywood movies.  This was a classic story where the characters fell in love without first having sex.  It was like the old time movies where before it was physical it was emotional. I have always been a fan of the color and music of Bollywood movies.  This was a classic story where the characters fell in love without first having sex.  It was like the old time movies where before it was physical it was emotional. i love twilight the books and movies and as soon as a read the third book i ordered the movie and i usually do not like books turned to movies but i liked this one as all the other twilight movies i great ending to a decade of films, while the books will always be number one its nice that Hollywood did good by Harry, Thanks to Daniel, Emma, and Rupert who made the characters come alive for us all i liked the movie when it was animated bringing to life for the teenage audience was a good movie. It sounds cheesy but it shows you that love should be about who you are not what you look like. it was a good movie though i did not like the fact that it makes the Latino community sound like only when they are poor can they appreciate their heritage, It does not matter whether you have money or not, but that you are close and appreciate all your family. i am big fan of the franchise therefore i was happy when the producet arrived and even more happy that it arrived professionally packaged and well cared for i definately got my money's worth. the story was good and provided more insight into Cesar Chavez's life.  There is not much literature on this man or on the struggles of the migrant farm workers.  I like that this story not only presented what Chavez and his family wanted to accomplish for others but struggles within his family.  It shows that while Chavez, was the face of the migrant farm workers he had a great support team in his family and loved ones. there are no lies the videos describe an era when I was not alive an era that for all the racisms & hate it had was still more peaceful & hopeful than the world we live in now. this was a gift and the little girl who got the movie liked it, she has always liked Pocahontas so it was a no-brainer, however if the kid is more into the Pixar films do not get her this movie as it is old style Disney and she will not be impressed with the animation work but the songs are nice and easy to sing as the child who received this movie sang along with it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A114XQ5NYCAL59," This is one of those movies that will always make me cry at some point. I love a story that involves a few main characters and follows them for a span of time. And some of these characters are just amazing. The characters are funny, crusty, fanatical, and even a martyr type. This story hits a lot of highs and lows of ""real life"" situations. I watch it about once a year anymore. *S* This is a good couples movie. My husband and I have watched it together more than once and I have seen it with a couple of girl-friends before. Make some popcorn and be prepared to feel a lot of emotion throughout this one. It may take a little while to get into the language of this movie, but it is well worth it in the long run. The Irish accents make it a bit difficult to catch each phrase at first, but once you get the hang of the words it is an hilarious bit of fun. This movie is one of my all time favorites. Christopher Reeves plays a very loveable character while Jane Seymour plays the hard to understand heroine. It can still make me cry if I'm feeling whimpy to begin with. An enjoyable movie for bonding with your daughters or girlfriends. This is a wonderful movie. John Wayne plays a real macho man and Maureen O'Hara plays the quintessential spunky woman that will never let a man tell her what to do. Well worth watching as long as you remember how the world was when this movie was made and take it as it was performed. Don't try to put modern day views onto it or you will not enjoy it at all. We read all of the books and have seen all the movies. We are now giving the books to our grandchildren and making sure we have all the movies as well so they can watch them with us when they visit. Of course, we watch them ourselves now and again too when we are in the mood for some fantasy! These movies are well done, almost believeable and can be very entertaining. Love them all. *S* We read all of the books and have seen all the movies.

Of course, we watch them ourselves now and again too when we are in the mood for some fantasy! These movies are well done, almost believeable and can be very entertaining. Love them all. *S* This movie is very well cast to help you believe the characters would develop into the familiar faces from the original series. I enjoyed watching the original TV series, none of the spin-off shows ever captured my attention like the original. During this movie you learn the background of the characters and it still holds the excitement of exploring new and wonderful worlds never before seen by man. If you enjoy the other X-men movies, you will enjoy this one. It explains a lot about how Wolverine came to be the way he is and even brings some family to light. There are some wonderful graphics and special effects as well as some personal emotion with a couple of characters. Definitely violent in most parts, buy a well done movie. I recommend it to round out a collection of the X-men movies. *S* As with all the other Harry Potter books and movies, this one was very well done. Having read all the books, we wanted to watch all the movies too. These movies follow the books very well and the cinematography is wonderful. Some of the scenes do get violent, but it is part of the story and there is no unnecessary extras. Highly recommend the entire series. This was a good choice for our collection of movies. It is great for those days when I just don't feel like doing anything in particular but want to watch a movie with a good moral. *S* This MIB movie gives a background to the main characters. There is a villain being pursued by the good guys and a pretty nasty character he is. A bit of a different twist on this one, a lot more emotion shows up in this story as compared to earlier ones. There is some good acting in this one. *S* We already had the DVD of the Second Best but had not seen the first movie. We were not disappointed . We saw the second movie at the theatre but now we have also seen the first one on DVD. Both are enjoyable and it really didn't matter that we saw them out of order. The first movie explained a lot about the second one but it really did not affect our enjoyment of either movie. *S* All of the Hobbit movies have been good ones. This was a grand finale for the trilogy. We watch this trilogy, and Lord of the Rings trilogy, at least once a year now. *S* Although sequels are not always as good as the original, this one surprised us. The movie is fantastic and gives a lot of background information on one of the earlier Star Trek movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and have already watched it a couple of times. Highly recommend it to Star Trek fans. We have both Red and Red 2. We saw both films at the theatre and enjoy watching them at home now that we have the DVD's. If you like Bruce Willis, you will like this movie. Helen Mirren is fantastic as is Mary-Louise Parker and John Malkovich. *S* All of the Hobbit movies have been good ones.

A4M26LTRLCUAV," I enjoyed this DVD which  I couldn't find at my local Walmart or Target, While on vacation we thought of Amazon and two day delivery. We checked it out...Amazon had th film and it arrived two days later in the mail.  My grams daughters and I finally got to see the movie together. We really enjoyed it. Rating for my son who loves this classic TV series. He watches it over &'over again. The picture quality is very good, just as if watching from this on TV. If you like comedy & adventure my son age 13?would say get this series. I didn't give it five stars because I don't believe history backs up Oliver Stone's theory that Alexander was gay. The rest of the movie seemed to be historical correct. The acting was excellent. I'm glad that Amazon offers historical movies done by first rate actors whether I agree with all of the premise of the films or not You will be spell bound as you watch a small boy as he finds ways to survive & obey his father who told him Not to leave this WWII  torn area until he returns for him.  He is almost caught on several occasions... Very touching, nail-biting film. I was so glad to find it on Amazon at a cheaper price than at my bookstore.

I actually accidentally saw this film late one night on T.V.  I cried and cried and cried. After seeing it I had to find a copy for all of my children and grand children to see. We need truthful heart wrenching films like this to remind us of how wrong society can get if its citizen's  aren't  watchful.  I turned to Amazon in hopes of finding this movie...yes!, there it was. Get it..watch it... Don't miss this wake-up call. I actually accidentally saw this film late one night on T.V.  I cried and cried and cried.

Get it..watch it... Don't miss this wake-up call. I was so thrilled to find this classic redone by in such an excellent way.  The acting was terrific...I was spell-bound for the entire movie, even though I knew the story. Masterpiece Theatre out did themselves this time!! Thanks Amazon for offering this on Prime. I am recommending this classic to all my classic film buddies. I felt as if I had wasted an entire night after viewing this pointless, movie that glorifies rebellion, lawbreaking, , death along with every four-letter word you can think of in almost every line of speech. I really wish we could get back to well written stories that held your interest like the older movies did. Then,maybe, the film makers would leave out the filth to fill in such poorly written scripts. I saw this on encore several years back. I was so glad to find that I could purchase the movie from Amazon. Outstanding movie, actors just draw you in...great historical info too, interwoven within. I love this video...I have already shared it with friends who plan to purchase their own to enjoy later. #Suspenseful  #Shocking # Intense  #Riveting #Patriotic #Heartrending #Emotional #Informative ...  Very hard to imagine what these soldiers went through and know all along it really happened.  This really makes you proud of the sacrifices our soldiers & their families give to keep America free. Purchased for 13-year-old son who loves old TV series. I like because there is no bad language or inappropriate behavior between couples. These things are hard to find if not impossible in current TV or movies. The video,is of the best quality...looks just like when on TV",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1NVW4NUXPOSJB," This is a GREAT movie. The acting is fantastic. Nicholson is just amazing also with the other guys. You understand easily why the movie won 5 academy awards. It's funny to see Dany Devito with hair and Louise Fletcher, the nasty but so quiet nurse, is so gorgeous and unfortunately evil. You won't understand how much you will sympathize with all those nuts but It happens. Thanks Milos Forman ! I was expected a great movie because I usually like the Coen brothers but Miller's Crossing was just boring. Too much useless dialogues for not many action scenes. Not many outdoor scenes neither. Actors were okay but the story is simply not interesting enough. On the other hand, I liked the special features. This is the perfect example of the bad movie. Bad SFX, bad acting, boring story plot. If you watch 'til the end, you're a champion and you deserve a reward. Avoid it even if you can watch it for free. Ok the actors are good but I expected something else. In this movie, the German soldiers and officers are just too kind ! I don't think that finally the whole story is believable. Don't expect the usual War movie with this one,You will finish in a court room mostly ! It's full of moral,justice,pride,honour...seen in far better acts before To end,this movie could have lasted 1:30 instead of the 2 LOOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGGG hours : an eternity ! Good acting, good story but too many coincidences maybe. Enjoy a great Cate Blanchett, the great Italian landscapes. The plot is working well and even if sometimes slow and seems long, make this movie enjoyable enough. The acting and filming are very good. Lighting is great. The acting is alright. This movie is quite good. Not historic. It's before all a fiction but the plot is well balanced. The only thing I didn't like is the 2 hours because It's pretty slow moving. For sure don't get this movie because you expect a true story or because you want to be scared. It's more kind of ""investigation & suspense"" movie. I was expected a good movie and i found this movie just not good enough ! Too many coincidences make this movie not realistic at all ! The character's dialogues are just stupid and it's also full of cliches. A great deception ! A movie for Grand Daddy and Mummy for sure. I hated it. Richard Gere is passing his time on the phone and in his bedroom. The movie is full of noisy sound. You expect to see something surnatural and you see nothing. The scariest stuff you will see,is few red lights in the dark. By writting based on true events, I wonder if someone is thinking we are all a bunch of idiots or something. This is a GREAT movie. The acting is fantastic. Nicholson is just amazing also with the other guys. You understand easily why the movie won 5 academy awards. It's funny to see Dany Devito with hair and Louise Fletcher, the nasty but so quiet nurse, is so gorgeous and unfortunately evil. You won't understand how much you will sympathize with all those nuts but It happens. Thanks Milos Forman ! If you loved The Ring and you are looking for something similar,do not buy or hire this crap. Bad actors,crap story and plot,I didn't find any quality in this stuff even the FX are not great! So if you are looking for the fear, re-watch The Ring instead of this joke ! Well it's like big brother but with actors and (not good actors actually) The twist is really twisted making this ""movie"" looking like a joke. Nothing exciting and nothing terrific. Is it scarry ? I guess the trailer is actually scarrier than the movie itself. Is it worth your curiosity ? I've been curious about it and I haven't found yet why ! You will have more fun watching Big Brother. All the cliches are in it..even the black cat ! The story is nothing else than kind of Jeepers Creepers .. It's even laughable ! Nothing really new in this flick. It's boring and you know easy what it will happen next one more time. A pity ..The beginning, the 5 first minutes are cool. It's a great movie...There is not a boring seconde. Matt D and the other actors are very good, the FX are terrific and the story is 100% action but quite smart. Nothing negative. If you like suspense, it's the movie u need. Very bad acting,bad SFX, bad lighting, no plot, no story except the one they stole to From dusk'till dawn. One star for the retarded guy who made me laugh. This is CRAP ! To avoid or forget.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2ZE73RFY0GD3K," This film's finale is a staged rifle drill by dancing girls -- and they perform as well as almost any military unit you will ever see, with Betty Grable calling cadence.  It's worth watching the entire film just to see them march. When, toward the end, they fired the torpedo into the body of the massive octopus resting up against the base of the Golden Gate Bridge, the projectile appeared to plunge into a big wall of gray peanut butter.  (Creamy smooth, not chunky.) This exemplary horror movie, about the dead wife of a health-spa owner who makes things unbearable for him and his clients, was not rated -- but it should have been R for gore and nudity.  A FABULOUS film... lots of horror/gore and scares.  Don't miss it. I bought this for my wife because she loves the film.  She will watch it any time it's on TV, and she was absolutely thrilled to have her own copy.  Believe me, buying this DVD for your wife will yield a really high return on investment, requiring very little future exertion or effort. I liked what Paul and Annabelle (on TV's Dinner and a Movie) said about The Cutting Edge:  It's the ""Citizen Kane"" of ice skating movies. The Grifters provides an extremely interesting look at some genuinely sleazy parasite con-artists who pretty much ended up living the lives they deserved.  The story is well told and the characters quite credible (albeit squalid). Myra Langtry, however, certainly appeared to be a fun date. We all know that Anakin will grow up to be Luke's father -- and it's evident from this episode that Anakin's father had to be Eddie Haskell.  I've never seen such simpering, sniveling and self-justification in a character since a long time ago, on a TV network far, far away. P.S. It was neat to see Anakin get the Terminator's right arm, after his own was cut off in the sword fight. This film is rife with gratuitous violence, filthy language, bloody fights, despicable people, disgusting situations, deplorable lifestyles and stomach-turning vignettes. I thought it was perfectly fine but my wife hated it. This turkey about rival biker gangs (featuring Dennis Hopper during his Easy Rider phase) was noteworthy for performances by Hopper, Jock Mahoney and Casey Kasem, but afterward they probably wished they'd never gotten involved with it. Most pleasing about this delightful little film, in addition to hearing Hugh Grant sing, was the surprise ending vis-a-vis the lead male and female characters -- I simply did not see it coming, and I have watched a LOT of chick flicks! This is an Amityville-Horror haunted house knock off -- though it is great to see Michael Parks of Then Came Bronson fame, together with Jessica Harper and Vic Morrow.  One would think that with a cast of this power, a better movie would have resulted. This hooter is noteworthy only for its look at the early Melody Griffith, who was quite young and different when this attempt at a comedy was released in 1980.  And Frank Gorshin -- as usual -- gave his role a lot more than it gave to him. Be advised, this is a MAJOR chick flick.  If, when my wife rented it, I had not been recovering from a recent severe knee injury that required extensive prescription med dosage, I would have found the film too indescribably painful to endure. I have seen a lot of chick flicks, believe me, and I thought I had learned all the tricks -- but Flirting With Forty wrapped up in a way I simply never saw coming.  Watch this and enjoy it... but be aware you will be completely blind-sided by the ending. It involves the DNA evidence.  Police cleared Liotta's character via DNA evidence, while the murders were in progress -- his did not match that of the killer.  But when performing the comparison, the DNA examiners should have observed something else that was extremely important.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3I76UJHITIO1U," This is one of my ALL TIME favorite movies!  I love all the actors in the movie!  I can't wait to find Evening Star (at a decent price!) the follow up to this movie. I bought this for my 2 year old great nephew.  He is going to LOVE this movie and all the characters in it.  I can't wait to watch him watch it!!!! We just returned for our annual Mackinac trip, where they try to sell the movie for a much higher price.  So, it was fun to watch the movie and notice all the changes (and there are plenty!) from the island from the filming of the movie til now.

A37B3O457INKEA," BULL DURHAM is an excellent movie about minor league baseball in North carolina. It has enough authentic atmosphere to appeal to any baseball fan - particularly anyone who has ever followed a minor league team. The acting is first-rate and the script is loaded with humor. Kevein Costner,Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins are superb and director Ron Shelton deserves high praise for producing an admirable film similar to his later WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP. DICK TRACY RETURNS was the second Tracy serial produced by Republic Pictures. It had 15 chapters and the story was about Dick Tracy's adventures in trying to put a stop to a ruthless gangster named Pa Stark. The popular Ralph Byrd again had the role of Dick Tracy and the cast also included Lynn Roberts, Charles Middleton and Jerry Tucker. Jack Ingram appeared as Slasher. CHARLIE CHAN's SECRET is the first Chan film produced by 20th Century-Fox. Charlie is in San Francisco trying to find a missing heir who unfortunately is murdered after he reappears. The movie is hurt by the absence of Keye Luke leaving Warner Oland to solve the case without the usual blundering antics of his number one son. The Charlie Chan series was dropped by 20th Century-Fox after this film. Charlie solves a murder which happens while he is a guest in a desert castle. Sidney Toler has the role of Charlie and Sen Yung plays Jimmy Chan. John Larkin wrote the screenplay and the director was Harry Lachman. Mostly because of the plot, I have always considered CASTLE IN THE DESERT to be one of the better Chan movies. In THE THIN MAN GOES HOME Nick and Nora visit Nick's parents where Nick solves a case involving sabotage and spies during World War II. No liquor is available at the house and Nick is forced to work while sober. William Powell and Myrna Loy return in the starring roles of the series for the fifth time. They are joined by Lucille Watson, Gloria De Haven and Harry Davenport. Richard Thorpe is the director of this low budget entry. THE CHINESE CAT is a surprisingly good war-time film by Monogram. Sidney Toler is back as Charlie and Benson Fong has the role of Tommy Chan. Tommy is Charlie's number three son. Manton Moreland as Birmingham Brown begins the movie as a cab driver and ends up as Charlie's chauffeur. Some of the best scenes take place in a fun house. SONGCATCHER is not a feel-good movie but it will stick in your memory for a long time. In spite of the sombre tone, the film is satisfactorily resolved at the end. I am glad I saw the movie and I recommend it. The acting and directing are superb. Pat Carroll as old Viney Butler stands out in particular. Warner Oland played Chan for the thirteenth time and Boris Karloff co-starred in this somewhat overrated film. Music credits were shared with two others by none other than Oscar Levant. Boris Karloff's role was that of an operatic baritone. He actually used his own singing voice. Lee Chan was again played by Keye Luke. CHARLIE CHAN IN RIO is one of two Chan films turned out by 20th Century-Fox in 1941. Sidney Toler plays Charlie who is chasing a killer in Rio. Sen Yung is again cast in the role of Jimmy Chan and Victor Jury also appears in the movie. I liked it - particularly the Brazilian atmosphere and the cabaret scenes. Sidney Toler plays Charlie and Sen Yung has the role of Jimmie Chan in this movie about the great detective solving a homicide which happened on board an airliner. It's another 20th Century-Fox film with Harry Lachman as director and a strong supporting cast. BULLDOG DRUMMOND'S SECRET POLICE is a 1939 movie. Much of the action takes place in Drummond's ancestral home. John Howard is Hugh ""Bulldog"" Drummond and the cast includes Heather Angel, H.B. Warner and Reginald Denny. In BULLDOG DRUMMOND'S BRIDE Phyllis and Drummond are finally married.  The film is based on Sapper's novel BULLDOG DRUMMOND AND THE ORIENTAL MIND. The cast includes John Howard, Heather Angel, H.B. Warner, Elizabeth Patterson and Reginald Denny.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2HWD9PTM7RBXN," At the beginning of the movie, it is fairly obvious what the outcome of the movie is going to be.  Yet, it is still makes for interesting watching as to how it eventually evolves.  Richard Gere and especially Julia Roberts  turn in stunning performances in this easy to watch movie that will have  you laughing.  The subject matter is not so mindless that it will insult  one's intelligence either. This movie is filled with suspense.  Wesley Snipes and Bruce Payne  delivery excellent lines and are very convincing in their roles.  The  actions scenes are just totally extreme. I just love the way Wesley Snipes  boards the plane from underneath. This movie is very to the point as there  are few dull and wasted moments.  Not quite perfect due to a couple of  unbeleivablle happenings but overall a winner in my book. If you have a dark sense of humor, Bullets Over Broadway is for you.  Chazz Palminteri is quite amusing as a mobster who discovers his own playwrighting talents.  John Cusack expands his role to playing a neurotic Woody Allen type who just wants to get everyone on the same page.  Jennifer Tilley is quite amusing in an offbeat way.  Good for most audiences. Totally awesome movie with jokes and sight gags galore.  Eddie Murphy is one talented man playing all those roles of the Cletus family plus Buddy Love.  A little crude yet but alot of laughing......gas!  Definitely pick this one up and pass on the sequel as that one overdoses on the fart jokes.  This one uses a multi-joke formula all the way to success. A very touching movie that tells me that love is definitely out there even for those who have lost a significant other.  Its interesting how Bob and Grace's relationship evolved.  I guess when you find true love, things just have a way of working out.  A little slow at the beginning, but heart warming in the end. Boy the characters on the Indians Baseball Team.  Willie Mays Hayes, The  Wild Thing, The Voo Doo Man, and the ageing catcher and more all are loaded  with comedic moments.  Even old Ueck gets into the act. The story line is  simple but plenty effective.  Its not on the level of Bull Durham or White  Men Can't Jump but there is sure plenty to laugh about. Julia gives a very strong performance in this movie.  Oscar Winning, not quite but one can really see true character in this film.  Albert Finney is credible in a supporting role.  However, the story just drags on  in spots  when excess development is just not needed.  Overall I will admit that the  movie gives you an appreciacion for those people whos tand up for others  who are taken advantage of by big impersonal corporations. This light hearted tale will please both children and adults.  Eddie Murohy's humor is funny without being overly crude.  I admit its hard to look at Shrek for an entire movie.  However, action packed and entertaining this movie surely is. This is a decent family movie.  Eddie Murphy is silly and goofy rather than crude and funny.  It certainly is enjoyable if not overly sophisticated.  But the message is good which is to pay attention to your children.  However, the story is quite predictable.  Truthfully I prefer Comming To America, Trading Places, and The Distinguished Gentlemen, but this movie is at least light hearted if nothing else. Same format same results.  Yes, its amusing but the story line is so identical to Meet The parents.  Robert Denero's character is so mistrusting of his future son in law.  Hoffman and Striesand are a couple of goofballs.  A little funny but alot silly and full of nonsense.  Ben Stiller seems like the most sensible one in this film.  Don't buy all the hype.  This movie is OK but certainly not over the top. Bruce Almighty is an amusing tale of a 40 something man's battle with his midlife crisis.  Jim Carrey is quite amusing particualrly in his physical comic style.  Morgan Freeman and Jan Aston fill in nicely in supporting roles.  The moral of this movie is to not take life so seriously.  There can be some joy in handling the lighter side of life.  Some moments are a bit disjointed but overall the good outweighs the bad and overdone. I am amazed at all these bad reviews.  Whereas maybe it was not on the same level as Get Shorty, there wre some captivating scenes.  John Travolta and The Rock alone make this film reasonable.  The back and forth hustles by all these hitmen can get a bit annoying.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the laughs and a decent storyline.  Nothing that is going to win acadmy awards but certainly a nice light movie. Adam Sandler's movies are oh so goofy.  His idea of humor can be annoyhing at times.  However, intermixed between all the childish behavior is that true love is oh so beautiful.  And Sandler does show his vulnerable side.  Fortunately this movie is relatively short because it is not long on depth.  Nonetheless, the characters are all kind of amusing.  If you are in the mood for something not overly ellaborate and light-hearted, this flick will fit the bill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1VZDPPHLYZ0KB," I absolutely loved this movie when I saw it for the first time in the theatre.  Each of the actors portrayed in this move did a superb job.  I have added this movie to my movie collection! Kathy Bates does it again with her immense talent!  She portrays a maid who is accused of murdering her boss,  Her daughter ""Selena"" is portrayed by Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Selena is a big time New York reporter who comes to aid her mother.  Selena's father died years before.  The family's troubled relationship is seen in flashbacks throughout the movie.  The movie is based on a Stephen King book, so all is not what it seems!!! This movie is a feel-good movie and fun to watch.  The pairing of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks as the protagonists are the perfect chemistry.  I recommend this movie to all couples! A Danish family helping to rescue their Jewish neighbors from the concentration camp. This movie has a great script and a fantastic cast:  Sam Waterson and Mia Farrow among others.  MIRACLE AT MIDNIGHT is a move with a beautiful message that stays with you forever! Bad choices were made and now 2 young people are in prison for life.  They had such promising careers and they threw it all away for vengeance and murder.  A beautiful young lady gone forever how sad!!! I have not watched the movie as of yet but I know the story very well.  It's a heartwarming story of the love and devotion between people and dogs.  I am an animal lover.  I refer to all animals as furry honeys.  God Bless them!! A heart breaking movie. A must-see movie. It reminds one of the struggles, courage and determination of Anne, her family & the millions like them who during the Holocaust wanted only to live.  All these lives, estimated at 6 million, exterminated because of their religion & race.  One can only wonder how different this world would be, if Hitler never existed & Anne, her family & the 6 million Jews had lived......... I always enjoyed watching The Waltons when it aired in the 70's.  John-Boy and the Grandparents were my favorite characters.  Earl Hamner, the narrator told the stories from his childhood and gave us the realness of the show.  The movies in this collection are a dear treasure to me.  I hope to one day purchase the entire Waltons series. This movie is a birthday present for my son Chad. He is a HUGE Beatles fan!!! As a musician, he knows the tremendous influence THE BEATLES have had on music.  They changed music forever!  They also pioneered the music video!  No other musical group can make that claim!!! My husband was given this movie as a present.  Mainly because he happens to look like the actor Danny Trejo.  What a coincidence!  My husband had a good laugh and totally enjoyed the movie!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AWDRB5IFMMBRE," This is a must watch for everyone.  It pretty much tells us what is coming and why.  It also tells us what we need to do in preparation. I highly recommend it. Nemo is good for any age.  It's such a sweet movie/cartoon and is one that I watch at least 2 times a year.  I recommend it for as wholesome story about survival and perseverance. This was a real eye opener.  It included many studies being demonstrated with babies.  Not only was it entertaining, but also educational.  I highly recommend it for parents, grandparents, babysitters, anyone that is around babies. This was always a fun series for me as a young person.  Topper was so prim and proper and that starchiness was always tested by the invisible friends he had.  I enjoy watching this again after so many years. National Geographic always goes above and beyond.  This is a very well done documentary on what is known and what some of the possibilities might be where we are unable to go.  It's fascinating. I was not familiar with this movie and took a chance.  So glad I did.  This is an excellent movie and I would highly recommend it.  You will fall in love with Hachi. While I had never seen this particular movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it as I have each of the Free Willy series.  The friendship between Willy and humans is so precious and shows the incredible intelligence of this mammal.  It makes a person fall in love with his heart.  I'm grateful for wholesome movies that can be watched by anyone. Our 3 year old grandson loves Thomas and we enjoy getting DVD's for him because he watches them over and over again.  Now his little brother is enjoying them too.  It's a great investment for us.  The DVD's came quickly and in perfect shape.  The only downside is they are not the most up to date, but they still enjoy them. This is a great historical series.  The photograhpy is good.  Black and white is not my favorite, but it is authentic.  The audio is not real good, but appropriate for that era.  All in all, I would purchase it again. There are so many Thomas DVDs out now and our grandson loves them all. We enjoy giving him these DVD's because he never tires of them.  Trains are the toys of choice and Thomas is a favorite.  The DVD's came quickly and in great shape.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A7H1KEK5WILXK," this is the movie that made julia roberts career and what a great movie,  offers so much  it is so funny and will make you cry  this is a movie i watch from time to time and it never gets old  one of the best movies ever and such a great cast  no one else could have played any of the roles this is an old movie but one that has everything, it makes you laugh, cry, and maybe a little angry but one of my all time favorites  and i am a movie buff and have seen a lot of them two people fing each other almost from the start and the way they find  one another is kinda comical and odd at the same time. the more the are together the more they want to be together and are a good match tho the two are so different  they do compliment each other I love the classics and this is one of my favorites. This cast was perfect for this movie. William Powell yet again gives a great performance as does Irene Dunne. No matter how many times i watch it, i still laugh as though it was the first time of seeing it. i purchased this movie for my 3 year old niece because she is really into thomas the train right now  while she likes it she likes the cartoon movies of thomas better My niece loves Thomas the train and friends so i bought this to go with it. what a great idea, she watches it often and it is a good tool for teaching. I am such a fan of van Johnson and this movie offers romance, disappointment, and a lesson of what money can do.  Elizabeth Taylor plays the part of johnsons wife and while we want them to make it as the movie progresses  we wonder can they or will they. Games are played ...love is tested.... A child caught in the middle who doesn't understand. Watch this movie I am such a fan of van Johnson and this movie offers romance, disappointment, and a lesson of what money can do.

I purchased the lord of the rings trilogy from amazon and plan on doing the same with the Hobbit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AOV3MWDPHDHCX," I have loved this movie since the release. It is real to life and shows what women can do when your marriage breaks down. Goldie, Bette and Diane are a dynamic and hilarious three some. Lots of laughs in this movie. Great cast! Great story line and all too familiar southern approaches to the world! I have loved this movie for a long time and finally broke down and purchased it. I smiled the entire time I was watching it for the first time! Great woman's movie!! I enjoyed Julia Robert's portrayal of Erin Brockovich. She did an awesome job. More than that this is a story about finding one's true purpose in life and making a difference in other's lives. To this day, Erin Brockovich continues to champion causes that others do not chose to touch upon! Well done movie and highly recommended. I really liked this movie. It gave insight into abductions for ransom types of situations and what people are up against, both captives and those striving to save them which added to the multi-dimension of this movie. Crowe and Ryan wound up having an affair while making this movie. The chemistry is evident. Another great acquisition for my collection. Really great movie! I really liked this movie.

Crowe and Ryan wound up having an affair while making this movie. The chemistry is evident. Another great acquisition for my collection. Really great movie! Divorces are rarely painless. Diane Lane's character goes through a bad divorce and needs to get her bearings. She takes a trip, a gift to her, to Italy and falls in love with Tuscany. A lovely movie all about life changes and right timing. Highly recommmended. I forgot how much I enjoyed this TV series. I truly enjoyed watching all of the seasons and the 2 movies that were tied to the show!! Well done and a staple in my DVD collection!! I'm not a Jane Fonda fan; however I love Jennifer Lopez's comedic timing! The movie is full of laughs and surprises. I just had to add it to my collection. Highly recommmended. I am a Meg Ryan fan and this movie has a great cast of supporting actors. It's cute, funny and provides an all too familiar life challenge and how Meg Ryan choses to get around it all!! Great, uplifting movie for a woman! I am a Meg Ryan fan and this movie has a great cast of supporting actors. It's cute, funny and provides an all too familiar life challenge and how Meg Ryan choses to get around it all!! Great, uplifting movie for a woman! I love history. While this is based upon history; I am certain the story has varied to make it even more enticing. I enjoyed this series about King Henry VIII. Well worth the purchase and will enjoy for years to come. I love thinking outside of the box. I love history and have followed the stories of the Masons, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei (sp?) and more. I also love a great mystery. Tom Hanks is superb as usual and the story line is very moving. Dan Brown's book is acted out well in this movie. Highly recommended. I'm not much of a musical movie fan; however this was quite good. Great inside look at what burlesque is like. Wonderful acting. xTina does a wonderful job in this underated movie. Her song 'Bound to you' is beautiful and Cher's performance of 'You haven't seen the last of me, ' has become my all time favorit song Cher has performed!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2KMRC9TS9YGCW," christmas is about families, what if you don't have any, great movie to watch on a cold snowy day with you girlfriends or a date. Makes you laugh, makes you cry, one of the best kinds of movies. it is a favorite of my husbands and myself, we use a few of the movie quotes often, when we saw it for a great price we purchased it for our home collection I got it to see the clothing, I am interested in historicle fashion, but found a beautiful story about love in a difficult situation. If you like historical movies this is for you. great movie for kids. My eldest son loved it as a boy. My youngest is fond of the movie real steel so decided to get this movie for him and he loves it too. I understand this movie is meant to be from marie's point of view, but I just believe that their is more substance to any person then this movie gave her credit for. but wow, awesome eye candy if you are into historical fashion. we first saw this on one of the movie channels, my 6 year old seemed to like it, so because it was a good price on amazon, we bought it for our movie collection It is one of those corny scary funny movies, that you love to watch over and over again. So for valentines day I purchased this collection to celebrate valentines day with my hubby and this movie. He is also a Jennifer fan. I got it as a rental and would probably not watch it again, but my husband and I really enjoyed watching it. Kept our attention and did not seem to drag, a bit of eroticsm and thriller. Great date movie. I purchased because price was great and it was a good reference for clothing of the time, however it is an excellent movie about real people at a time when the fight for womens rights was at it's hight I watched it at first to get a good reference for the clothing during this time period, however I grew to really love it and had to purchase it. it happened to be a great price on amazon too I watched it at first to get a good reference for the clothing during this time period, however I grew to really love it and had to purchase it. it happened to be a great price on amazon too I watched it at first to get a good reference for the clothing during this time period, however I grew to really love it and had to purchase it. it happened to be a great price on amazon too we first saw this on one of the movie channels, my 6 year old seemed to like the action in it, so because it was a good price on amazon, we bought it for our movie collection I thought this had a better plot then most scary monster movies.

I really enjoyed this and recommend watching it to anyone that is a thriller buff my husband and I went to see this movie, and it had some great laughs, we love adam sandler and drew barrymore in the wedding singer and loved them just as much in this movie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A38PQR2I7COAR5," Steel Magnolias is the old south no longer there. These women were typical southern belles who love each other and bond as a community. This is a great movie for families but PG I enjoyed this film first because it amazing to see three HE men of Hollywood doing such a great job as Drag Queens. I watch it over and over and like it more each time. It seems just natural and everyday for these guys to wear drag. I certainly have changed my mind about Drag Queens in such a positive light. Good for them! Light hearted and enjoyable! This is a movie to sit back and enjoy. Plot is gay and simple...Guy meets guy. Guy chases guy. Heart gets broken and he moves on. This is a must for your library! What  a feeling!  The energy and sensitivity in this movie is fabulous. The relationship between Hanna(older former Ziegfeld dancer) and Alex the want to be Ballet dancer now welder is tender and real. Her devotion to God is moving and the Catholic church is moving. If you can get past the fact that Jennifer Beal does very little dancing herself in the movie(stunt double does most of it) it is a great movie for the family. This is a wonderful movie for ages 15 up. Liza Minnelli is at her best. It gives you hope that with much work, you can achieve your dreams. It also teaches us that to love someone is not to take away their dreams. Buy this one and pray for a sequel! The story line was true to life. Mother not accepting her son and son being defiant but loving. Anne Bancroft was a natural the Jewish mother who loves her sons but lets them know where she stands on their decisions in life. Harvey stands his ground and does a great job. This is a classic for any family dealing with Gay issues. This movie..Strictly Ballroom was a wonderful dance movie. It is set in Australia where dance contest are taken very seriously. Paul Mercurio looks and sets the stage for great Ballroom dancing. The costumes are a bit silly but the energy is truely there. This is not a family movie but for individuals over 18. Our Miss Brooks  PArt one is a smash. It is to bad the entire series from televlsion is not avaliable on VHS. Eve Arden is the perfect teacher. Where was she when I was in High School. This is a family movie-G rated! This is a graphic movies for the 1980s in nightclubs like 54. There is no happy ending in this movie, but it is a step into reality that we do not wish to return to(open sex, sexually transmitted diseases, and cold heartedness) Studio 54 was very real I am afraid. I was there and this movie makes it safer and better than it really was,( a very dangerous place) Thanks for the memories. This is not recommended for anyone under 21. One of the rare acting and a good one of David D. I prefer him in roles like this one which is charming and not like Californication...The dancing routine of the old men with Carroll O'Conner is a must see! This movie..Roseland, takes place in teh most famous Ballroom in the world. The stories within are dated but its great to hear the big band sounds and the dance competitions only Roseland can have. The ballroom is still open in NYC today but not like it was before..too much rap and not enough traditional Ballroom dancing. Very Good movie! This is Joan Crawford at her best. This is must see. Crawford said in an interview that she did not have to act to play this role as she was the character. See for yourself. Its fantastic! Forget the negatives. this movie is a classic great. A widow gives herself a second chance on life and lives. The Stardust ballroom is alive with life. A must for the 50's plus that to spark their life. Life is not over till its over. Add this one to your library",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AFU8Q0K8UR1Z4," Another wonderful movie about relationships. I can't understand those who who don't agree this is a 5 star movie but each one has his or her perspective. I think this movie is as good as any other out there. - so well acted, written, directed, photographed, etc. Goldie Hawn is enjoyable no matter whenther the movie is good or bad. Steve Martin is just another comic, actor or whatever IMO.  This movie started out really weird but it's worth staying with & turns out to be quite enjoyable, with a neat ending. These action-thrillers are not at all like real life, but they are great fun. This movie has the the best chase scenes I have ever seen. But I wonder what ever happened to Dierdre? I was 12 when I first saw this movie with my parents & it made quite an impression on me.  I was taking classical piano lessons at the time & the piano playing in this movie mesmerized me. It is a thriller & done very well, good actin, writing, directing. Worthwhile viewing. I was 6 years old in '41, when I heard the announcement over the radio that Pearl Harbor had been attacked, & Pres. FDR's subsequent declaration of war before Congress. As a kid, I was able to understand we were fighting against terrible tyrrany. Now, 70 years later, the US is suffring from a self-inflicted wound that appears mortal. They don't make comedies like they used to. Or maybe it's just that I'm a grumpy old man. Well I am a grumpy old man and they don't make comedies like they used to. But just think of all the money that was paid Nicolas Cage & Holly Hunter to be a couple of screwballs in this movie & be happy. A very well made noir B movie, with  good photography, direction, and acting but just an average story. Not much suspense to it, but for a B movie it is definitely above average & worth viewing for film noir fans. 4-1/2 stars. I loved it. Very entertaining. '40s atmosphere in Los Angeles that I knew as a kid with modern movie technology. Even seemed like '40s actors, before modern obscene language came into use. Thrilling & enjoyable. Highly recommended! This film is such a pleasant sruprise. It touches all the human emotions without going overboard or being melodramatic. Though it was a B-grade movie, the script writing was tight, the direction & acting were excellent. And Marilyn Monroe's acting was worthy of special mention - even Oscar level. A B-movie worthy to be remembered as equal in quality to most any other. This film is amateurishly written, directed & photographed. I can understand the reviewer who said he laughed all the way through the film. I appreciate Roy Scheider but even if he had been in the class of John Barrymore it wouldn't have helped the film. I couldn't believe how the camera wandered all over the place. Those who compared this to Hitchcock's films are just plain nuts. I remember this film coming out when ! ws 10 years old.  Finally I got to see it. An OK film but the ending is just tacked on after all the hoopla. What a disappointment! This a movie with so many loose ends, poor writing, poor directing - leaves you screaming for someone like Hitchcock to take over, then leaves you shaking your head in disbelief at the amateurishness of this film. The ""dead"" husband, when he does finally appear, looks like just another teen-age punk & does not fit in the film at all. Not at all enjoyable. One of the best movies I've seen of its kind. Actually, 4 & a half stars in my estimation - just a little bit shy of perfect in all aspects. Very Good entertainment!!! A lot of good scenery, Gregory Peck stars & Dawn Lyn does such a good job playing the little 6 year old girl, not much of a plot but aw shucks enjoyable, good entertainment. Worth viewing. I found the whole thing sort of silly, except for the ending. The Star Trek effect of entering the gate on the return to Los Angeles was interesting, & so was the ending episode at the L.A. airport. Otherwise  - yawn......  But maybe that's just me. It's received 5 stars from others so you may also enjoy it. Truly a classic, very well made with a consummate performance by Bette Davis & I always enjoy Leslie Howard (Pygmalion, GWTW). So enjoyable to watch, dealing with basic questions of human relationships between the sexes. I don't know how this compares with the book, but the story was well told. Good acting all around. A 5-star cinematic gem with all elements of the movie intermeshing perfectly - the main plot containing sub-plots, vignettes all joining together in striking B&W photography & supported by an excellent musical score. I thought as I watched this film I'll want to watch it over & over again just to appreciate how well it's made - but then the ending leaves you shaking your head.  Kudos to Robert Wise & all the others. The Phantom was one of the comic strips I enjoyed reading as a kid & seeing this movie based in the time period in which I was born brings back memories. I am surprised at how faithful the movie is to the comic strip - as good in its own way as the first Superman movie starring Christopher Reeve. But I am still wishing a movie would be made of my favorite superhero Capt. Marvel using up-to-date movie-making techniques. All the reviews it seems extol the virtues of this fine movie & they're right. ""Raw Deal"" pushes all the right buttons in the film noir digest. I was a kid during the '40s & remember seeing a number of such films, but not this one. Excellent photography, direction, good writing & acting - very worthwhile, especially for film noir fans. Absolute confusion, senseless violence & murder. Film depicts those with ""good intentions"" accomplishing nothing of value. I travelled through Yugoslavia several times & found nothing attractive or interesting about it. The people seems to have no sense of meaning or purpose.  A very dreary land. Hilarious - I especially liked the guy who mumbled so much & was so protective of his stapler - & fianlly gor his revenge!  That made me cheer for him! As I watched the movie, I wondered if the maker was inspired by the films of Jacques Tati. Though this film has an obviously ultra liberal slant and and appears much of the time to be a confusing hodge-podge (or at best a collage) of events, still it is undoubtedly brilliantly scripted, directed, acted and edited. Other reviews here adequately examine the historical background. As pure entertainment, it is not perfect but it surely excels nonetheless. My political leaning is conservative, but I can recognize and applaud a good film when I see one!  Highly recommended! There's a number of ""ghost"" stories like this one - all of them better scripted, This one is so cliche-ridden it's a shame the actor's talents were so wasted. I especially enjoy Sally Fields & her acting talents but she had very little to work with here. With almost 1000 reviews what more can be said? I found myself laughing & clapping my hands spontaneously & excitedly. I don't know any other movie I have ever done that for! This movie should be headlined: ""Dedicated to women everywhere!"" I love the ladies! More power to 'em!!! If you like ""human interest"" stories you might like this movie. It's a about a guy who's a loser, a patsy, a man that allows everyone to walk all over him - a totally uninteresting sort of guy as far as I'm concerned. Halfway through the film gains some momentum & just when it begins to really get interesting suddenly it's over. It has no plot whatsoever. Not my kind of film, but maybe it's you ""cup of tea."" This is nothing more than a zombie undead movie trying to pass itself off as a commentary on the Vietnam war. I'm surprised at all the shallow-minded reviewers giving this movie raves & a high rating. The problems facing those who were involved as veterans in the Vietnam war (or any war) deserve better, more thoughtful treatment than this nonsense. A Christmas potpourri of characters & stories interwoven in expert fashion. A movie that is definitely a ""keeper"" among those that have something worthwhile to say at Christmas time. Definitely worth 5 stars. A well-written, well-acted, well-directed, well-made movie. In a way it plumbs the depths of human drama & yet in the end warms the hearts in a way that tells about God quite well. Truly a gem very worthwhile watching. Hilarious - I especially liked the guy who mumbled so much & was so protective of his stapler - & fianlly gor his revenge!  That made me cheer for him! As I watched the movie, I wondered if the maker was inspired by the films of Jacques Tati. A dog is brutally shot & killed by a teenager. As the dog's owner seeks justice,, people wind up dead. It's impossible to view this film dispassionately. Very well acted & sensitively diected, it will make you think deeply. I remember this film coming out when ! ws 10 years old.  Finally I got to see it. An OK film but the ending is just tacked on after all the hoopla. What a disappointment! I can't believe one reviewer writing about how ""unrealistic"" this movie is. It's a ""feel-good"" comedy - one of many that I have seen over the last 78 years that Hollywood has made but I've never experienced in ""real life."" Most movies are ""unrealistic"" in some way - they are a way of escaping reality for a while in fact. Good acting, direction, well-made but exceedingly weird movie. If life isn't weird enough for you then maybe this movie will be. If you like to be confused then watch this movie & you will be. This one heck of an entertaining movie! Dialogue full of dry humor, good acting & directing. The only part of it that seemed unnecessary was the Montana Kid  momentarily in bed with the heroine, but other than that the movie was hugely enjoyable.. One of those old-style comedies that used to be fun, entertaining & cute but is no longer because we live in a much harder world. And I remember films all the way back to the late '30s, so I can't believe seeing Debbie Reynolds in only a very minor role ""shooting the pecker off a turkey."" That may have been funny back in the '50s, but not today. Any film that stars Danny Kaye is automatically worth 5 stars as far as I am concerned. I first saw him in a movie while just a kid back in the '40s & became enthralled with his comedic talent, Later I actually met him at a public swimming pool in Beverly Hills. There are two comic actors whose films almost always automatically rate 5 stars  in my opinion & they are Danny Kaye & Buster Keaton. But no one is better at what he did then Keaton. He did all his own stunts & some of them - like the waterfall scene in thie film - were dangerous. He was a true genius. What do you call something that pretends to be something it isn't? This movie pretends to be another ""Casablanca."" It has the look, it has the feel, but it turns out to be a cheap imitation - actually just another B movie that makes otherwise good actors act as though they were nothing much more than amateurs, because the writing  - & sometimes the direction - is so amateurish.  A waste of time, actually. Very well made & entertaining. After having seen so many WW2 films & knowing how interested the Nazis were in art collections, I have to wonder whether this film was at least partially based on fact. A really silly movie with a very contrived nonsenical plot of black witches versus whilte witches. The special effects must have looked quite effective on the wide screen in theaters, but aside from that - what is there? Having taken a solo cross-country hike myself in the California Sierras about 40 years ago that involved spiritual matters, I could identify with the characters in this movie quite readily. On the basis of what I know from my own experience I can with assurance state that this film is excellent on all counts & worth 5 stars. This film is a gem as far as I'm concerned, & I am doubly grateful that it was made by Christians about a Biblical subject matter. I was delivered from atheism by God more than 45 years ago so was totally involved in this film. IMHO it did a very good job in all aspects. At the ending there tears in my eyes. I'm 79 years old & looking forward very much to being in heaven. This film proves that there can indeed be ""too much of a good thing."" Plummer did a masterful job portraying Barrymore, but Barrymore was more interesting on  the stage & in film then he was in real life.apparently. His greatness could take a good script & make it better but what amazed me was his ability to take a badly written script & through his acting make his part a delight to behold. I do not think I have ever seen a better documentary, one that has better caught & held my interest. I was especially impressed by Mrs. Loving as a person. Who she was, was very well communicated. Perhaps it was because the director was a women helped the the sensitive handling of the subject matter & those involved. Kudos to all on this one! An excellently written, acted & directed film depicting an Australian Aboriginal trying to cope with government laws but being frustrated (or ""screwed"") no matter what he does. Reminds me of other stories about citizens being in like situations in other countries & cultures - e.g. "" The Good Soldier vejk."" The scriptwriter has a unique function in film-making, playing  the role of a god in relation to the characters he creates, using them as puppets, doing with them whatever he pleases. In this particular film the scriptwriter was a capricious god, using his characters to play a trick on the audience. The writing is only mediocre, though with excellent photography, competent direction & good acting. This is not a film I would recommend to anyone. I remember seeing this with my parents as a little boy when it was released during the '40s. I remember that I was enthralled by it then. I have been collecting as many of he films of that period as I can remember & am glad to add this onde to my collection. A sick movie made by sick people for sick people (I guess I am in the category too since I was stupid enough to watch the whole thing. When it ended I felt sickened by it.) Well acted, directed written & photographed  - more so than most movies, with the music not intruding & overdone as is so often the case. Gets better as it goes along, with quite a good finish. Very entertaining. A weird film that combines realism with surrealism, drama with fantasy, plays romantic background music where more foreboding music might be expected & has a totally illogical ending. But though it leaves the viewer wondering it's explained by the fact that the director is Fritz Lang & it's his way of movie-making. Makes you sort of think about life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2UOY8UC1GWGK4," I truly believe throughout the entire film that Laura Mars was innocent. I couldn't wait to find out who the ture killer was.  Great Supporting cast of Tommy Lee Jones and Raul Julia. Anyone who spent most of their childhood in the 1970's will truly apprciate Crooklyn.  I related to everything in this film.  From buying candy at the corner store, watching the Partridge Family and going to visit  relative down South.  Spike Lee truly makes you think an appreciate your  youth. It's a shame that Robert Downey cannot find more scripts like Chaplin.  This film proved to me that if Downey can set his mind on more positive things. He could could create magic like he did in Chaplin.  He definitely  deserved the Oscar nomination. A classic film about life in a southern chain gang. The part that kept me amused yet sick to my stomach was watching Paul Newman trying to eat fifty hard boiled eggs.  It couldn't tell if he was really sick to his stomach or  just good acting. The realism of Al Pacino role in Dog Day Afternoon is almost 3-D like.  You actually feel that you are bank with the hostages or outside with crowding cheering for Sonny.  Setting in the summertime makes excitement  more tense and thrilling. Sissy Specek and Martin Sheen perform well in the story of love on the run. It's heartbreaking to see Specek's torn between the love for a rebellious young man.  And the heartbreak of leaving her dead father  knowing that the man she thinks she loves is also the man who kills him.  People who live in large cities will love the panoramic scenes of the wide  open prairies. Eddie Murphy is amazing in this ""guy"" film.  Lots of adventure and shoot-em-up.  I wish I could be able to get away with some off the stuff he does in this film.  Great cameo from Damon Wayans. I found Magical Mystery Tour interested and well done.  It looks like a well-done home movie.  Although it does drag in the middle. It has a kind Monty Python flare to it.  My favorite songs were Fool on a Hill and I am  the Walrus. If you don't love laughing until all of your insides are in extreme pain. Please don't see this film.  I also recommend to check your blood pressure before seeing this film. John Cusack is excellent in this role of a young man trying to end his life but actually he want just a little recognition. My favorite part of the movie is the drag racing with the guy who sounds like Howard Cosell. School Daze will be interesting to some.  But after watching it; a viewer could see in two ways. One, if they went to an all-black college they might look at it with enjoyment.  Or, if they didn't go to all-black college, it  will make think, ""Did I really miss anything?"" Jill Clayburgh is this film.  It has a wonderful clamness to it and you can sit down and really enjoy watching it.  Michael Douglas is great as the love interest.  Those who are Yankee fans will love the shots of Yankee  Stadium. To some, Hard Day's Night would be considered boring due the fact it's in black and white. But I feel that's what makes the film more enjoyable. John, Paul, George and Ringo are very natural in their acting.  They look  like they are really having a good time. I found Quizshow very entertaining. The detailed work of the sets and costumes really brought the movie true to life.  This movie is real treat for viewer who were not born at that time. Chapter Two is a sweet story. You are so happy that the things turn out for the best.  I love the way Marsha Mason fights James Caan to make him understand that even though they rushed into their romance. Love will  always mend a broken heart. Of all his concert movie.  This one is a pure gem.  You will laugh as hard or as long in your life.  Please, check your blood pressure after seeing this one. When I first saw the Cannonball Run. It almost reminded me the movie, ""The Gumball Rally"". Except in the Cannonball Run; the plot and the character are most interesting.  My favorite character in the film was  Captain Kaos.  Jackie Chan also has a marvelous cameo in this film. Arthur is a wonderful ride through a poor little rich man's life.  He's forced to into love only to find true love all by himself. My favorite part of the movie is when Arthur goes searching for Linda and winds up getting  into a fight with her neighbor. After seeing Pulp Fiction.  I thought there couldn't another cool film until I saw Jackie Brown. What Pam Grier did for this film is what John Travolta did for Pulp Fiction. Samuel L. Jackson is great as a wannabe  gangster who has to learn the hard way that crime doesn't pay. Micheal Keaton character in this film shows the truth when someone is in denial of their problems and are afraid to face the truth.  The film does show how this country has to realize that our country has a serious problem  with drugs and alcohol and we need more rehab places. After seeing Pulp Fiction.  I thought there couldn't another cool film until I saw Jackie Brown. What Pam Grier did for this film is what John Travolta did for Pulp Fiction. Samuel L. Jackson is great as a wannabe  gangster who has to learn the hard way that crime doesn't pay. This film really goes to into the world of mental health.  Joanne Woodward and Lee J. Cobb are excellent as patient and doctor working together to find the hidden truth of one woman's past. Of all the Planet of the Apes movies; this had to be the one that really brought a tear to my eye. Roddy MacDowell and Kim Hunter are excellent as the innocent explorers who are misunderstood by modern human about the  world that come from.  Great cameo by Ricardo Montelban and wonderful  surprise ending.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2JTD6D79HNA5X," This first original is good enough for it's time. it's creepy and disturbing. Issac is the best character in the whole film. I never seen the re-make or the other 5 films of the same name, but this one is good and delivers well. Wow this movie got bad reviews. Yet no one explained what was so bad about it!! If your going to say it's bad, have some backup. Anyway, I liked the movie. I never saw the first two so I can't compare but whatever. This movie had it's moments. Not as fun as ""Suspiria"" but better than ""Mother of Tears"". It had the same color effects which was cool. I liked it and could easily watch it again. I liked the main song in the film. I loved this film. It was great and strange. I loved the 7 1/2 floor and all the characters. It's interesting seeing the changes people have as they be john for 15 mintues. People always want to see what it's like to be someone else and we finally get to see it happen. This film was funny and cool, just like most of the John Water films. A good cast and a great plot. You can't go wrong. It'a about a nut-job director who kidnaps a hollywood actress and forces her to be in his underground film. I won't give anything away, but it's a must see. I watched this movie with my mom. She kept complaining that she couldn't tell what was going on. I watched and saw it all perfectly. It works like this. Some people can't handle a movie with a nonstop shaking camera, while others can. If you can, than you are a step closer to liking this movie. Anyway, I thought this movie was good. The monster was cool looking and it was all well done. I think I  got this film as a bonus when i picked up the really good Halloween remake. Anyway, it was ok. i watch it again last night. It has it's moments and I like the idea of the dead coming through the daily tech that we use. Not really scary and a little slow in the beginning but it was a good attempt. I like Pulse 2 more so. One of Shyamalan's good films. The village is about a village that is olden time and no one leaves because of the monsters that roam the wodds surrounding the village. The plot is good, the ""creatures"" are cool lookin and the ending of the film, where everything is revealed, was really well done and unexpected. The cast is good and the acting is good as well. It's a well thought out film. I had my doubts about this movie when it first came out. Once again I was wrong when i finally watched it. It was really funny. I laughed from beginning to end. All the acting is topnotch and it never got boring. Much better then the original for sure. I really enjoyed this film. Loved the creepy mutants and all the intense scenes. Good acting and very scary.. well not for me, but for others who have not seen much or get scared easily. It's about a family that gets stranded in the desert and are attacked by bloodthirsty mutants, a typical plot in a way. Worth seeing on a friday night though.... Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were great in this, just like Shawn of the Dead. Simon is a cop who is re-assinged to a small place where the crim rate is very low, yet the accident rate is so high. There are great and funny moments in this film. The main shootout at the end of the film was amazing. Nothing like an old lady using a machine gun. I can watch this over and over. It's a great zombie movie. Love the old movie style of it, with the lines running through it and a whole part of the film missing so the movie goes from point A to C with point B missing. I love the opening dance scene with cherry and that hot music number. Her gun leg is cool and there is good humor here and there. Not as good as the first one, thats for sure. It was too dark sometimes and I couldn't tell what I was seeing. The repeated stabbings got boring and it was hard to follow here and there. The first Halloween I could watch every day, but this one I can wait to watch again, though I still liked some parts of the movie. Not as good as the first one, thats for sure. It was too dark sometimes and I couldn't tell what I was seeing. The repeated stabbings got boring and it was hard to follow here and there. The first Halloween I could watch every day, but this one I can wait to watch again, though I still liked some parts of the movie. This one took a long time to come out for some reason. It doesn't have the same color effects as the other two but it's still enjoyable to watch. People go all evil and she has to find the mother of tears and stop her. It for sure had a different feel to it than the first two. Too bad it wasn't made a year or two after Inferno. It does have it's moments though. I saw parts of first Rest Stop but this one is ok also. They go further in the back story of who the driver and family in the winnebago really are and how they came to be. The people in this movie go looking for the people from the first film. There are some good moments and it's not that boring. Hopefully though they won't make another rest stop movie. another zombie movie, how shocking. Well i did enjoy it. it's like ghost zombies. they come out when you go to the park and then vanish at dawn. It's worth seeing if you like zombie movies. Since my two most fav. actresses, Penelope Cruz and Scarlet Johansson, were in this movie there was no way I was going to pass the movie up. I enjoyed it fully. The narration flowed smoothly throughout the film and the acting was good. Well i like how it's all 4 films in one. I can make more room for other films that I buy. It sucks though when you buy all the films, and then something like this comes out, like pooie. There isn't much to say. If you like Nightmare on Elm street and don't got all of them, then pick this up. I love all the dance numbers, especially Penelope cruz's and Fergie's. They are entertaining and somewhat arousing. The rest of the movie is good but kind of slow here and there. You won't fall asleep watching it but you will start wanting the next music number to happen already. The acting is good enough and it's worth a second watch. I was always interested in this movie. It looked like crap and in a way it was so yay for buying it at a cheap price. It got a little boring during the film and the acting was as real as it could get. I thought the idea of the film was neat but with more of a budget, it might have made a great horror film. This is the third boogeyman movie and it's still fresh. I like this one and the second way more than the first movie. The deaths are interesting and the girl slowly losing it is always fun to watch. The boogeyman is cool looking and at least it relates well to the other two. Basic plot. Guy doesn't like people and enjoys the quiet (sounds like someone i know). Then he dies and comes back to life but can speak to ghost who annoy him and need his help. He falls for the wife of the main ghost and changes. Its the same idea but with different elements. It's still good and funny but nothing new. Good people and acting though, say yay for that. I remember watching this in the theaters and there were groups of girls all over who were covering their eyes and sometimes screaming so that was a good sign the movie was good. I liked it. Not many movies show a jewish exorcism, and it's a good refresh from the same ole exorcisms we see. It's a everyday teenage horror flick, such as ""the uninvited"" and ""one missed call"", but it's still fun to watch It's so 70's. It's a reverse of the real world. Aliens are the inhabitants and the human is the alien. It's a good film but i don't get into the whole hippie alien thing. Gets old after some time. I love the little moving camera thing and the dog that looks like the aliens from ""Alien"". It was fun to watch but nothing i can't wait to watch again. I like all the effects of the ""in-between"" world. the movie was long but the pace seemed right. i ditched class to see ""bones"" when it was out and i didn't regret it. I was also reading the book at the time so it was cool to see how the movie stuck well to the book. This film reminds me of ""Dude, Where's my Car?"" I won't compare but this film was funny. It was well done and it was exciting seeing how the events of the previous night unfolded. From the missing tooth, to the baby in the closet, to the tiger in the bathroom, it's one funny moment after another. Maybe it's true that the more you can't remember the more fun the night must have been. This movie was short but good. I didn't know what to expect. I'm not a huge fan of Peter Pan, but I like Tinker bell.. for some reason. Anyway, the movie had it's moments and laughs. I loved Tinker bell's companion during her search for the treasure. He was so cute and fun. The voice acting was good and the story was enjoyable as a whole. Young kids will enjoy this movie but it's standable for all ages. Another film with hot young girls getting slashed. It has a simple plot. A prank goes wrong and someone dies. The girls keep it a secret and then get knocked off one by one by some revengeful person. The deaths are interesting and involve a tire iron. I watched it twice and i can easily watch it again. This is the first movie I seen with Beyonce Knowles in it. I think she did a real good job. The movie was suspenseful and a little obvious since there are many movies out there with the same theme. Ali Larter gave a good performance as the obsessive tempt. It's worth watching at least once. I been waiting for this movie to come out since I saw it in the theaters. It was super good in my eyes. It was scary and there were very exciting moments. Its a nice refresher to all the slash and die films. It's not totally obvious what happens throughout the film. The proposal was more predictable than this. I never thought much about this movie but my friend bought it so i watched it with him the other night. I liked it a lot. I didn't know what to expect. This movie isn't as obvious and predictable as people think. It was funny and the aliens were cool looking. The ""controlling"" of the grandma and Ricky or whoever was great. Their battle royale was amazing. Anyway,this movie is worth seeing. It's fun and enjoyable for everyone. You know the cover of a film can say a lot and this one says creepy. I enjoyed this film, especially the second time around for some reason. A few people wake up from a long sleep on a big ship and they have to fight mutated adapted humans while trying to figure how to get home or so. The creatures were cool and the suspense kept up. Pray you never catch Pandorum. I watched this last night at 2am but i was wide awake. The twist was good and perhaps not fully easy to realize. It took place in Hawaii which is always a nice change from same ole New York, though the movie was made elsewhere. I didn't know what to expcet but i wanted to see it. I liked it enough to want to watch it again. The charaters are interesting and who can you trust in this movie? For the most part, I thought this film was interesting. Megan Fox did a good job as a... demon or whatever she was. There are plenty of movies about chicks feeding off of guys, but it's always nice to see a new one. The movie was a dark terror comedy for teens so don't expcet that much from it. Another ""everyone's dead or sick"" film. Two guys and two girls going to an old beach house while trying to avoid the effected. It was a little slow at times but had some good scenses. I like Piper Perabo from Coyote Ugly, so thats the main reason I got the film. It could have been better though but i'd watch it again. Another movie with Ellen page and another movie based off a book. The film had good people in it and all the rollerblading was hot and fun. Since I enjoy rollerblading myself, I really enjoyed the film. The first District 13 was so much better. The dubbing was amazing and the action was hardcore. The movie just flew right through and before you knew it, the film as over.  This one had real bad dubbing and just wasn't as exciting as the first. I enjoyed it but not enough to rush out and buy it. The action was still good but the feel of the movie was just not there this time. Very entertaining indeed. Lots of good action and very interesting people. I was hoping for more usage of the dagger and going back in time, but eh, no complaints about this film. Jake G. did a good job as the prince. Not much of a scar the girl has if you ask me. This film is sort of like ""The Killing Gene"" so nothing new. Wasn't real exciting and i don't recall most of it, so i don't recommend it unless you need help falling asleep. I never thought much about this movie but my friend bought it so i watched it with him the other night. I liked it a lot. I didn't know what to expect. This movie isn't as obvious and predictable as people think. It was funny and the aliens were cool looking. The ""controlling"" of the grandma and Ricky or whoever was great. Their battle royale was amazing. Anyway,this movie is worth seeing. It's fun and enjoyable for everyone. It was short and good and simple. A prostiute is killed and then comes back for revenge. She's uses a gun which is a good method when on a low budget. The acting was interesting and you either like or don't like this film really. I liked it enough. It's an independent film with some good moments. The title basically sums up the whole movie plot. Sex and murder at a pleasure based camp. The main girl i think had the best acting skills though everyone did a pleasent job. There's a lot of female nudity like always but i can't complain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A2GLVVN7QVTAV6," I love this movie.  I remember when it came out and I still watch it as if it's my first time seeing it. Great movie. Whoopi is such a talent actress. I think everyone should have seen this movie by now. But it is still needed in everyone's DVD collection. Angela Bassett & Lawrence  fishburn did an excellent job acting in this film. Lisa is for sure the queen of comedy. I really enjoyed this DVD. The things that she talks about will  have you in shock and more in shock that your laughing at it. THIS DVD IS 1 OF MY FAVORITE'S NOW. I LOVE THE COMEDY IN THE MOVIE AND THE MESSAGE IS SO IMPORTANT. EVERYTIME I HAVE COMPANY OVER THIS IS 1 OF THE DVD'S I PULL OUT TO WATCH. I REMEMBER SEEING THIS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND I'VE NEVER SEEN IT AGAIN UNTIL I DECIDED TO LOOK FOR IT ON AMAZON. I ORDERED IT AS SOON AS I SEEN IT. I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I WATCH IT WITH MY GOD CHILDREN (AGES 2-8). I purchased this dvd because I love both of these movies. Leap of Faith is really my favorite.  Although it gives a bad representation of the church but a great love story and I love the gospel singing. Now i just need to buy the sound track for the Leap of Faith movie.

I'VE WATCHED THIS DVD A FEW TIMES SINCE I PURCHASED IT.  I LOVE TO HAVE COMPANY OVER AND WATCH THIS DVD AND DEBATE TOPICS DISCUSSED IN THIS DOCUMENTARY.  IT IS VERY ENLIGHTNING, INFORMATIVE, INTERESTING, FUNNY, SHOCKING. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS DVD.... I LAUGHED FROM BEGINNING TO END. I LAUGHED SO HARD I HAD TEARS  ON SOME OF THE SCENES. THIS DVD IS VERY FUNNY. EVERYTIME I WATCH IT I LAUGH LIKE IT'S THE 1ST TIME I'VE SEEN IT. I love this movie. It was well told and the story line is great. Sandra bullock did an excellent job and the movie was just great. I would suggest this movie to everybody I truly liked this movie. It was funny and had a really important lesson to be learned. It really showed the drastic differences in the cultures of the world today.  GREAT LOVE STORY This movie was good and kept my attention during the whole movie. I only watched it once and don't think I'll watch it again unless it happens to be on cable and nothing else is on. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS MOVIE. I HAVE MAD ALL MY YOUNGER COUSINS WATCH THIS MOVIE SO THEY CAN LEARN FROM THE STORIES TOLD IN THIS MOVIE. EXCELLENT WORK TYLER PERRY. I really enjoyed this movie. It kept me interested from beginning to end. I watched it 2 times back to back when I got it in the mail. Denzel did a great job. This dvd is excellent. I love how it captures her talent. The quality of this video is great. I must have watched it about 5 times in the last 2 days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ACOPMVTZGQB0E, This is a great movie in that it is jammed with great actors and any movie that you are laughing one minute and crying the next is a winner to me! I had this on VHS so had to get it on DVD I've always been interested in the actual people who were on the titanic so this fictional story was very interesting to me as well and they did such a good job replicating the sets to reflect the ship etc. One of my favorites!! Every time I found this playing on TV I would watch it-don't know why for sure-maybe because I grew up watching movies with these actors as I'm not a huge fan of any one actor in this film but I think it was well made and I decided I had to have it in my DVD collection. I love this movie and was very happy to see it issued on DVD; while parts of this movie may be dated it is fun to watch a movie set in a time when a teenagers biggest problem was getting a date. I'm also a Connie Francis fan so it was a special treat to have her songs/singing incorperated into this movie! I loved this movie from the first time it premiered on the Hallmark channel-it had me laughing one minute and crying the next so to me that is the ultimate in movie watching!! The actors in this movie are great and this is a ten in my book!! This is such a good movie and every time it was on I would watch it so I figured that I should just buy the DVD so I can watch it anytime I want >) This is one of my favorites-like with some other movies; I found I watched it every time it was on cable so I decided to just buy it-it touches your heart and makes you laugh too- a good family movie I think. I first saw this on Netflix and liked it so much that I bought it on DVD It is such a sweet story and I liked the main characters/actors in the movie! Rent it first and see if I'm not right that it would be a good addition to your DVD library. I love this show and thanks to Amazons customer service reviews I knew that buying individual seasons was better than buying the boxed set! The customer reviews are SO helpful when considering purchases!! I have this program on VHS and I really enjoy watching it and being able to see the white house and how she transformed it! However afer reviewing the sellers that make it available here I will buy it on the the JFK website as it is cheaper! This is a really GOOD collection-this is one collection that both my husband and I enjoy and can watch together-most of the movies I like are (according to my husband) chick movies but as I say-we both enjoy this collection and am glad it is a part of our library. This is a really GOOD collection-this is one collection that both my husband and I enjoy and can watch together-most of the movies I like are (according to my husband) chick movies but as I say-we both enjoy this collection and am glad it is a part of our library. I saw this program on TV and liked the way and amount of material that they covered;they had things in this program that I had not seen before and I have watched alot of JFK material so was happy to see it out on DVD; so that I could add it to my collection of history. I rented this movie from Netflix with no expectations and was surprised at how funny it was! The dog was great and I found it interesting that in reading reviews on here some loved it except for the birthing scenes-to each his own as the birthing scenes were my favorite! The supporting cast made this movie for me and I now have it on my amazon wish list to buy! I didn't think I would like this movie as much as I did and I found that I would watch it every time it played on cable so I just decided  I should have it for my DVD library :) First of all it's a Ken Burns program so that in it self made me interested and once again Mr. Burns has given us a glimpse of our history that is interesting and informative and if you like history you will like to add this to your library-not only does it pull in our love and fight for the cocktail hour but it has gangster info. with in it so check it out!! I have been a fan of this show for so long-it was great that they offered this complete collection at such a great price but they sure went cheap on the packaging and missed the extra's that normally come with complete series collections!! This is such an interesting story and it is done by Rory Kennedy-Ethel & Bobby's youngest so it makes it extra special-if you are interested in all things Kennedy as I am you will like this program!! I watched this more than once when it was on the history channel and Tom hanks is an added bonus as the narrator! It you like history you will like this DVD and if you are into Lincoln you should have this on your shelf! I have loved Elizabeth Montgomery since Bewitched and she shows her acting chops in this-the best version of Lizzie Borden I've yet to see-a recent remake was done and while that was good this one is much better I believe and I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD for so long as my VHS copy is pretty old so I can't wait for this to be sent to me!! :) This is a great series! it has voices you recognize and is very complete in it's overview-if you are into history you will want this and if you want president info this is a must have! I have allot of Kennedy programs and books as I'm so interested in that whole camalot erra and this is a great collection of things that I did not know and more importantly from viewpoints that were new to me-Robert Drew did a great job with this and so I look for his name on things as I know they will be well done and informative. I love this movie and waited so long for it to come out on DVD and amazon let me know when that happened and now this movie is a part of my DVD library-color me happy!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A19YOPP52C17CZ," I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie.

Alan Rickman's voice was such fun to listen to that I couldn't have cared less about Costner's accent, or lack thereof. Costner was a cute hero, Rickman a delicious villain, and all in all a really enjoyable movie. I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained.

I thought I was settling in with a beautiful, epic film.... not a piece of cheesy fluff. I expected beautiful scenery and cinematography...but most of it looked fake. I must have just misunderstood what I was getting. I only finished it because I had laundry going and bread baking....no worries about getting caught up in it and letting clothes wrinkle and bread burn.

ADFDWNGYTD21T," Like an old friend, this movie always brings laugh, love and tears.  It is a great mix of comedy and drama and the performances are first rate.  I saw it in theaters in 1989 and as a gay man, just coming out, it was real comfort food.  Always five stars for this movie!  I'd give it six if I could :) This is a fun movie from the 60s.  Cast includes the most handsome Clint Walker, Martha Hyer, Keenan Wynn, Jack Elam and Nancy Kulp (from ""The Beverly Hillbillies"").  Mr. Walker was one of the hottest male forms to come out of Hollywood and to see him shirtless during two or three scenes in this film is stirring to say the least. Even Stephen King has to have a few B flicks in his catalog and this cetainly fits the bill.  It is a fun and quick way to pass 90 minutes if you want mindless monsters and cats galore. Just discovered this gem.  Fabulous acting by all, but I'm a big fan of Anne Baxter and Barbara Stanwyck, so will need to add to my collection!  The score is by the wonderful and talented Elmer Bernstein, so you can' go wrong with that as well.  I highly recommend this motion picture!  Five Stars!!! All the bibical movies from the 50's are fun.  This one is worth viewing just to see Yul Brynner with hair.  Also, George Sanders is always a great presence on the big screen.  Pop the popcorn and enjoy! I love the cover art.  I'm both a DeMille and Claudette Colbert fan, so I'll probably add this to my collection.  Now, if we can get Paramount to release a 60th Anniversary Special Edition of DeMille's ""Samson and Delilah"". I would love to see the early days of ""Y&R"" on DVD.  Episodes of the early days of the Foster and Brooks families.  I'd love to see Snapper, Greg, Jill, Laurie, Peggy, Chris, Leslie and all the other characters.  Bring it on! If you are a Lizzie Borden junkie you need to add this one to your DVD library.  I've been to the Borden House and taken the tour and this means so much more now that I have been there.  Now if we can just get the ABC TV Movie from 1975 with Elizabeth Montgomery on DVD, all will be well. This DVD is great.  I very much enjoyed the selection of songs, the venue and her voice never sounded better.  Carly has always been on of my absolute faves from the 70s (along with The Carpenters, Olivia Newton-John, ABBA, Linda Ronstadt, etc.) She looks great and gives a great performance.  You won't be disappointed in this purchase. What are you folks griping about!  Volume 1 was great, great extras and the theme music.  Yes, I would like the entire season, but this is much better than any collection thus far, so let's enjoy!  Volume 2 gets 5 stars as well! This should really be a great set.  None of these have been released yet on DVD and ""Four Frightened People"" has never been released on video as well.  I'll definitely have a set! I thought there was a lot to enjoy about this show.  The costumes, staging and performances were quite good and the subject matter is as always, timeless.  If you are a fan of the movie, watch this and see if you can pick out some of the similarities. This should be a fun and enjoyable set.  There were a lot of funny and witty moments from this show.  Hope it sells well and that there might be other sets released as well. The cover picture does not include cast member Richard Long and to add insult to injury, two pictures of Lee Majors.  Just because Lee Majors and Linda Evans went on to do a lot more television, let us not forget the others and their contributions to this great show.  I hope the company will correct this glaring mistake before the release date! This is a good show, but needs to be sold in more inexpensive sets as well.  Just too much to shell out $150.00 at one time for those of us on a budget.  Hope they will think about repackaging later. Just ordered my copy and looking forward to viewing. Just to see sexy man Craig T. Nelson!  I love the cover artwork.  Craig has a beautiful manly chest and the artwork displays it magnificently.  Thanks MGM for releasing and giving such a hot pic of Craig. I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel yesterday and I thought it was fairly entertaining.  Nice suspense and not bad effects.  Good shots of the bear and not such a bad story.  A group of teens doing stupid things and how they must pay for their actions in the end.  Enjoy the suspense! I have waited so long for this movie to either come to the theaters or to DVD.  I wish I could have seen it on the big screen, but DVD will be fine.  I loved the movie ""Grizzly"" from the 70's with Christopher George and Andrew Prine, so I'm sure this will be a modern take on the bear against man story.  Should be lots of screams and thrills from what I've read. I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel yesterday and I thought it was fairly entertaining.  Nice suspense and not bad effects.

Timing was bad too with 911 tragedy pre-empting a number of shows.  It would be great to have on DVD.  Thanks. This was a fun, spooky and ghoulish find.  The stories are interesting and woven together in such a fashion that it works for a different kind of Halloween movie.  I rented from Netflix but will end up adding this one to my collection. OK, let me start by saying there will never be anything to match the 1939 version of ""The Wizard of Oz"", but this movie has a lot going for it.  Wonderful special effects, interesting story and fine cast.  Overall, very entertaining. I saw enough in the trailer to know the remake could never live up to the original 1959 classic, which is in my top 5 movies of all time (#4 to be exact).  Next Hollywood will try for ""Gone With The Wind"" and ""The Wizard Of Oz"".  Paramount would have done better if they bought the original from MGM and showed it again in movie theaters across the country. I guess it took the recent movie with Christina Ricci to bring this to a DVD release!  Just hope it is good quality.  I've been watching my copy I transferred over from VHS, which is fine, but want a cleaned up copy without commercials.  I love Liz Montgomery's interpretation of Lizzie...one of the best TV movies of all time!!! If you are looking for an intense fun filled adventure ride, then look no further!  This movie has great thrills and wonderful casting, especially Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard!  Five stars!!! Can't wait for the entire first season of this beloved show!  Fans have waited patiently for a long time!  Thanks again and hopefully we'll see the fifth season coming soon as well!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AEGR40GALMDJ4," This film is the ultimate Rat Pack movie.  It has great story, acting, music, everything that is required in a teen movie, it has.  The acting is good, and the plot grabbs you.  Detention can actually be fun.  The best and the greatest.  I highly reccomend this film. Anthony Minghella is a true magician.  He turns the best books into the best movies.  He is awesome.  Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, and Cate Blanchett come together in a smart ans classy thriller that will blow your mind.  This is one of the best assembled cast I have ever seen in the movie.  The film is seductive and thrilling.  It reminds me of the old movies of the 1960s.  I highly reccomend this film. Molly Ringwald did an good job in this film.  The movie wasn't the best brat pack movie, but it is enjoyable.  The supporting cast is okay, and the romance you are able to relate to.  All, in all good, and heartfelt.  See it, if you love teen romance movies. This may not be as iconic as some of the other films that the Walt Disney company has made, but it is definately a classic.  This gives us a more lighter whimsical look on Camelot.  The voice talents are great.  The animation is in the classic 60s style that Disney was into at the time.  The whole movie is fun. See it, it is not a masterpiece landmark of an animated film but very very good indeed. Sister, Sister, oh so fair.  Why is there blood all over your hair.  This film is awesome... a perfect thriller.  A definate classic.  This is the first film that I have seen with Bette Davis in it, and Joan Crawford.  Both their performances in this film were awesome and Oscar worthy.  I love psychological thrillers.  If they made more movies like this, thrillers might get nominated once again.  A Great Movie.  A Must See.  I Highly Highly Reccomend IT. In this film Disney dishes out two more stories that are very charming.  In feature one you meet lovesick Bongo the Bear, and in the second feature Mickey fills Jack's shoes and climbs the beanstalk with Donald and Goofy behind him.  The animation is good, and the music is great.  A definate must see.  I reccomend this film. During the seventies, Disney came out with a slew of films that were not huge like The Jungle Book and One Hundred and One Dalmatians, but a few stood out as almost awesome.  This is one.  In this movie, Disney takes you to two places it had never taken you, NYC, and the bayous of Louisiana.  It had great vocal talens, good animation, and a good gripping plot.  See it if you are a fan.  I reccomend it. This is defiantely one of Spieldberg's greatest achievments.  He truely captures the horror of D-Day and past events of WWII.  He leaves nothing to be imagined.  The performances, especially Mat Damon's and Tom Hanks are brilliant.  The gore and violence are shocking and gross but the effect the movie gave would be lost without it.  The characters are put through hell, and the film altogether makes you look twice at how lucky you really are. Definately one of Nicole's Best Performances this film is gripping anc chilling.  The acting is great and the plot takes you for many twists and turns.  This reminds me of an Alfred Hitchcock movie and it will definately be remembered. Tomb Raider is good fun and good for a rental.  The Movie itself will eventually be forgotten.  Angelina Jolie does good, and the plot it okay.  The effects are good, as well as the settings.  The movie is only okay.  See it if you love action. After seeing this I immediately wanted to tell everyone I knew about it.  It made me think like no other film had.  Naomi Watts performance was awesome as with the rest of the cast.  The story is wonderful with great plot twists.  This film will definately be remembered.  Well worth renting. I had zero doubts that this film would be great.  Everything about this film added more excitement and drama to the saga.  Being the middle of the film it was unstructured, but still packed a box office punch.  Once again the acting, special effects, and story were wonderful.  A great follow up, and a perfect set up for a final installment. With more action this film would be a lot better.  Sure it was scary, and the acting was great, but I expected visually stunning effects on top of the chilling suspense.  The cast were all wonderful, especially the children.  Mel Gibson gave his best as well as Jaquin Phoenix.  Good but not great.  Reccomended for Hitchcock style films. After seeing this movie, I left the theater feeling completely fulfilled.  Nothing about this movie was bad.  It may not be the best superhero movie, but it comes pretty close.  The movie shows more character development, and the visual effects are more stunning than the first.  It is definately the best sequel I have ever seen.  Awesome Awesome Awesome.  I highly reccomend it. This is definately one of the best movies of 2004 if not the best.  It is filled with dark moody settings, magic, and that Harry Potter glow that fills the films.  It immerses you into another world, and in this film you most definately get better glimpses into the characters.  The acting, story, and effects are all wonderful.  See this film. This film is dramatic, tragic, and all out depressing.  But the acting is what steals the show.  Halle Barry deserved the Oscar, and the film will be remembered.  Not the best.  If you are in the mood for happiness, skip this film. This movie may not be the best in special effects, but there is something about it that makes you like it.  Charlton Heston and Roddy Macdowell do really well.  The plot is very interesting, and original.  The atmosphere the movie brings is unlike anyfilm.  The planet is like earth, but very out of this world.  See the film.  Is a must see for any adventure fan.  I highly reccomend this film. Before watching this movie, I expected it to be that shallow piece of nonstop action kind of movies we had seen in some of the newer Shwartzenegger movies.  This film truely shocked me.  First of all, the story was great.  James Cameron really does a wonderful job on any film he does.  The acting was wonderful, especially Linda Hamilton.  This wasn't average, or mediocre.  It was really good.  One of my favorite action movies.  See this movie. When Arnold Schwartzenegger was the king of all things action this was his biggest movie.  He reprised his role as The Terminator, he played him more good guy friendly but just as tough.  Sarah Conner's character went psychotic, and her little boy grows up to be a thug.  The movie was full of action and thrills and the film ended sad.  It was all and more I expected from Cameron.  One of his better films. Tomb Raider is good fun and good for a rental.  The Movie itself will eventually be forgotten.  Angelina Jolie does good, and the plot it okay.  The effects are good, as well as the settings.  The movie is only okay.  See it if you love action.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AHXV3DA6QJRPY," The Blu-Ray version of this classic masterpiece is superb.  The sound and picture are amazing, and of course everything else is as it has always been: terrific.  Patton is a war movie about a man who was a major player in that war.  It is unforgettable.  Highly recommended especially on Blu-Ray. The Blu-Ray version of this classic masterpiece is superb.  The sound and picture are amazing, and of course everything else is as it has always been: terrific.  Patton is a war movie about a man who was a major player in that war.  It is unforgettable.  Highly recommended especially on Blu-Ray. The science here doesn't quite make it, but the movie is fun, so if, like me, that's what you're after you'll enjoy this flick.  I enjoyed it also because I'm a fan of the genre.  Recommended unless you're a scientist who gets irritated easily. This movie had potential with a great cast and a good story idea.  Unfortunately it is boring, and about halfway through I was hoping I could find a priest to beat the demon out of my TV.  Since I couldn't I turned it off. I don't know why Kiefer Sutherland is displayed on the cover of the DVD, as his role in the movie was relatively small.  Regardless, and especially if you're a fan of the genre as am I, this movie is an exciting look at life in a Japanese prison camp right at the end of the war.  Recommended by all means just don't expect to see a lot of Kiefer Sutherland. I don't know why Kiefer Sutherland is displayed on the cover of the DVD, as his role in the movie was relatively small.  Regardless, and especially if you're a fan of the genre as am I, this movie is an exciting look at life in a Japanese prison camp right at the end of the war.  Recommended by all means just don't expect to see a lot of Kiefer Sutherland. This is a fun, exciting movie if you are a fan of the genre, which I happen to be.  The actors did a good job and the script was solid.  Good sci-fi fun.  Recommended. I am one of those folks who has an appreciation for the old time horror movies, but this one doesn't fall into that category.  This movie is awful.  It moves at a snail's pace, is confusing, and ultimately boring.  I cannot recommend you spend your money on this dud. An extraordinary movie and I had seen it in the theater.  The blu-ray release however, is just as sharp and the movie is just as good the second time around.  Second disc had some great outtakes, background, and etc.  I highly recommend this product. This movie tried hard, and you can see that in the superb acting.  Unfortunately, the script fell flat, and the ending was hugely unsatisfying.  Too bad.  I had high hopes for this flick. This movie doesn't require a great deal of thought or introspection, which is exactly why it's a real thrill ride.  If you are looking for an historical drama that speaks to the life of Abe Lincoln, this may not be the movie for you.  On the other hand if you're just looking for a rather intelligent vampire flick, with fine acting, great scenics, lots of blood, some humor and terrific sound track I recommend this movie. I suppose when you watch a movie which talks about murders that revolve around the writing of Edgar Allen Poe you should expect to stretch your imagination.  Well, this movie does that, but in a good way, with outstanding performances all around and a rather ingenious plot.  I recommend it, and don't let anyone tell you how it ends..... This film will keep your attention, not only with Mathew McConaughey and his co-star's superb acting, but also with an intense script that looks deep into the troubled souls of those living in Bayou Country.  It has the requisite ingredients for a great film, love, violence, sex, revenge, and more.  I found the ending a wee bit unsatisfying however, thus the four stars.  Regardless I can recommend this movie.  It's well worth your time. I have a first class TV and first class equipment, but when I ordered Grabbers, and tried to watch it, I was unable to do so because the quality was so poor, not to mention the acting and everything else.  After about 15 minutes I just had to click off.  I can't recommend this movie primarily because of the terrible quality of the picture.  I wonder if there's a way to get your money back from Amazon? This is a nail biter of a series that I watched in two days.  I just couldn't get enough.  The accurate depictions of the Old West are mindful of HBO's now defunct western Deadwood.  This is a absolute must for fans of the genre and highly recommended to everyone.  It's never too late to love an outstanding Western. This is an extraordinary movie that I will long remember.  The storyline revisits the bad days of the '50's and '60's and exposes the dark heart of racism in America.  It also shows how hard work and love for country can elevate a man.  I highly recommend this movie. American Horror Story never disappoints and its third season is no exception, as the familiar cast works their black magic in a sometimes scary and all the time enchanting tale of witches and warlocks wreaking murder and mayhem on their otherwise peaceful community.  As usual I was disappointed at season's end, and can't wait for this awesome show to resume.  American Horror Story is America's number one fright fest with class and I highly recommend it. I didn't think it possible but the second season is better than the first.  This series will keep you on the edge of your seat, with plot twists, and unending excitement.  I highly recommend this series.  There are no cons, and all pros.  Watch it!  You won't be disappointed. I never saw the first version of this flick so I had an advantage.  If you like the genre, you will love this movie.  It's well acted, the Aussie scenics and accents are seriously cool, and trust me when I say there are some really scary moments.  If you don't want to think, and just want to escape into a nightmare world this is the movie for you. I loved this little movie and I think you will also.  It's about ruin and revenge, necessary ingredients for a good script and fine acting.  This movie fell off the radar unfortunately but it's certainly worth your time.  I highly recommend it. It's a decent, entertaining movie, but it's far from being a blockbuster.  The plot is a bit confusing and the acting, at times, is without passion.  Again, if you're not paying more than $5 it's not an altogether bad way to spend your time. Dubbed!  I would have preferred subtitles as the dubbing is just awful.  Secondly, the movie was a bit too low key for my liking, although the original premise, revenge, is always fun",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AAI57M3OXP5NK," Good Movie but this one is definitly for girls only because it has no action and Guys will probably find it boring.  Anyways I liked the movie and being a girl I loved this movie.  It had great one liners and had many wonderful stars in it such as Julia Roberts and Sally Field.  This movie released in 1989 shows it's age somewhat but will always remain a classic.  This is a must have for girls only. This movie is the start of Julia Roberts great career.  She was in movies before such as Mystic Pizza.  This is a great movie because it is great watching movies back at the dawn of the 1990s and how 1980s it looked.  This movie released in 1990 made over a 100 million dollars.  It had a good story and Richard Gere and Julia Roberts did a fine job at acting. This is a great collection of the Star Wars Trilogy.  The original, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of The Jedi.  The second two movies feature my favorite characters Yoda and Jabba the Hut.  The storylines to these movies were thin but you didn't care because of the special effects but on VHS these movies seem really poor.  I say add it to DVD and then I will buy it. This movie is not good to me at all.  This movie has a thin story line, Axel Foley makes drug busts for cocaine.  The movie seems like they took a Miami Vice episode and made it a movie. This movie released in late 1984 grossed an astonishing 234 million dollars.  The only highlight to this movie was it's soundtrack... Get the sequel at least that was better. This is a good movie starring Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroyd. The movie is about two pwerfull brokers switching the lives of a poor person played by Eddie Murphy and a rich person played by Dan Akroyd.  However, seeing this movie so many times that I know every joke and how it ends.  The DVD doesn't look impressive.  It looks like their is no special features. This is a cute movie made in 1987.  This movie was made when teen movies were fresh and original not like now which they are vulgar unfunny and mean-spirited.  As usual John Hughes makes a great teen movie.  I won't give the movie away but it doesn't end how you will think it ends.  I suggest this movie there isn't much on the DVD but the movie is just great by itself anyways. This was a very funny movie made in 1985.  John Cusack was hilarious in the role. My favorite part of the movie was the classroom scene because they want to learn at school, I just thought that was so funny, especially since you know everyone hates work at school.  I loved the lady who sang Better Off Dead, I downloaded it off a website.  This is a great comedy and I highly recommend it. This is a better sequel than most I Have Seen.  It could have been much better but as sequels go, It was pretty good.  They kept most of the same cast and had a pretty good story.  It featured a good soundtrack featuring Bobby Brown.  It was released in 1989 and it didn't do as well at the box office.  The DVD is pretty good.  Buy It if you really like Ghostbusters. I love this movie I must have watched the movie more than one hundred times and I am still not sick of it.  This movie is about the borg going back in time and altering the corse of the future but the Star Trek crew from the show the Next Generation was there to stop them.  I always love the stories about the Borg and this Star is one of the best.  I recommend this movie to anyone. This movie is not good because it has no story, at least that would have been understandable if it was funny and believe me this movie was not funny.  The reason for the three star rating is that there were a few jokes that were worth laughing at but I think it was still bad.  If you like this type of movie then go buy the DVD but there are plenty of funny movies to buy. This is a good movie starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.  It is about a small book store owner who has to battle the giant Fox Book Stores and she loses and then she falls in love with one of the owners of Fox Books Stores.  The DVD is good and is great looking in Widescreen.  If you want a better movie by Nora Ephron try When Harry Met Sally(1989).  I recommend this movie. I loved this movie.  I think it was the cutest and soolest movie.  This movie has great special effects and has a great story.  Some of the parts of this movie will make you laugh so hard and other parts will make you cry.  Released November 2001 this movie was a suprise hit and you can see why.  Much better than Shrek, this is a much better kids movie.  I can't wait for the DVD. I really didn't like this movie, it is way too predictable, it reminded me too much of the movie ""Overboard"" because Kate Hudson acts just like her mother in this.  This is nothing more than a date movie. So if you want to go out on a date. Then  you can go see this. I love this show it is my favorite guilty pleasure.  The characters are great such as Emily Elizabeth and Jetta, and the dogs Cleo, T-Bone, and Mac.  This show i a great children's show and even for the adults.  I recommend this show especially Clifford's Fluffiest friend Cleo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AEPJYN0NAX9N4," This is silly as can be... but hillarious!  I can't give you enough details, because it's a ridiculously stupid storyline.  But it's simply funny with every turn!  Ready for something as funny as ""Airplane""?  Give this a try!! This film was much better than I expected, however, it still is far removed from the first JP film.  A creative plot to return the professor to the island, that lands the ""tourists"" in a heap of trouble.  If you enjoyed the first two Jurassic Park films, you'll probably enjoy this one as well.  It is very suspenseful, and introduces a whole new prehistoric fear in the ""hunted."" I found this a bit funny and definitely odd.  The characters were really out there, and the situations certainly unusual.  I can see the Woody Allen influence in here, whom I've never found entertaining.  Nevertheless, the film isn't too bad... the neurotic Jessica Stein seems almost like the typical Jewish girl... but goodness can she find the weirdest men in NY.  Please tell me there are not men this odd!! The only way I can describe this movie is that it is weird.  But that word doesn't do it justice.  It's funny, hilarious at times, creepy, and more.  Brendan Fraser seems to select the oddest scripts, but delivers fun with a lot of style.  Bridget Fonda is spectacular in this film, delivering a strong presence.  It's odd, with a strong psychological twist, but kick back and enjoy it! Action packed, but lacking in plot.  This is a good movie, full of action... but quite a bit on the silly-side!  The stunts are ridiculous, and so are the personalities and relationships.  But all in all, it was a fun movie to watch.  I'm a big Bill Murray fan, and this movie is just his style... except he's in a supporting role this time. I adored this movie, it was exciting in the terms of the two characters uncovering a long ago love affair between two poets and finding a little more than they ever dreamed of!  The ending was not a real surprise, as the movie continuously shifted to give you the conclusion... however, the film is quite warm and endearing.  This is a must see for all that love a good romantic movie, with a little mystery. This is an excellent movie, and a must see!!!  Our whole family enjoyed this one, while it proved you are never too old to chase a dream.  The fact that it was based on a true story, just added to the story!  A good wholesome true-to-life family movie! I actually found this movie quite tiresome... like watching paint dry or something.  The characters were quite annoying, with the logic of five year old children.  I sat through the entire movie, hoping against odds that it would improve... however, it did not... in fact, it may have gotten worse.  I would not recommend it... the humor was dry, and the pace was slower than a turtle's. A bored married woman makes one enormous mistake and her entire life spirals out of control.  Each time she does something to cover up the affair, she creates a bigger and bigger mess.  Each time she tries to get out of the affair, it gets a little worse and a little harder to do.  The emotions run high, and the characters are ridiculously simple-minded.  Though the concept for this movie was good, it was quite unintelligent and weak. This was a fun movie to watch. We laughed, and even screamed watching it. Mostly we screamed about those flesh-eating bugs... ickkkkkk!!!! But this is one great light-hearted adventure movie. The kids liked it, and so did the grown-ups! Sure it is full of plot holes, and it's pretty silly... basically a humorous copy of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""-type move. This was a fun movie to watch.

I'm a huge Bill Pullman fan anyways, but even if I wasn't before, I would be after this film.  The urgency and intensity in this film is contagious, and leaves you at the edge of your seat.  This film has everything... danger, emotional entanglements, suspense, romance, deception, explosions, and more!  If you like action movies, you'll love this one.  There are many unique and utterly charming scenes here that will make this film worthwhile for anyone's tastes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A36NW00607K49I," As a student, Agent Starling is sent to an asylum to interview Doctor Hannibal Lecter, locked-away forever for being a psychiatrist who enjoys psychopathic cannibalism. ""Buffalo Bill"" another serial killer  just snagged a senator's daughter and Lecter is Starlings only link to  getting Buffalo Bill.  FANTASTIC, ON THE EDGE, GET IT! An Amish boy witnesses murder and soon indicates the  culprit as...well, I won't be the one to tell. In order to protect the boy, Harrison Ford (cop)  brings him back to his cloistered community.  This mystery murder ranks  high on meshing a thriller tale in a peaceful Amish environment. At times,  a few cliche'  tended to bog down the flow. Overall, this story is good,  enjoyable, for everyone. It's war time and several orphaned kids are placed in with a remote person  (Angela Landsbury) who is secretly practicing her lessons to become a good  witch. Pranks are playes, adventures are launched straight into cartoon  settings. This film is great fun. But if there are young ones viewing, it  might mean Mom and Dad need to stick by. Can be a little scary. Not major  scary. Just a tad. Well now I know a memorable way to remember how to do the-sign-of-the-cross. *L* Terrific comedy. Two bungling thugs steal money and evade their psycho boss by hiding out in a convent.  Why didn't they do  a few thousand sequels! This was has its moments. I was back and forth between 3-stars or 4-stars.  If you want to see a better version of Mark Twain's tale, see the one with  BING COSBY. It has much more charm and personality. The way Mark Twain  delivered this great story. If you enjoy clich'-jokes, perhaps you will enjoy this film more. I was  hoping for more of the characterization from Saturday-Night -Live type  skits where Murphy disguised himself, immersed himself, completely into a  new person. This was flat, fine for a summer movie with no expections.  The  special effects helped the rating up to 2. GREAT MURPHY FILMS are  ""Coming To America"", ""BEVERLY HILLS COP series"",  ""BOOMERANG"", ""48-HOURS"", and ""The Distinguished  Gentleman."" This film is based on Agatha Christie tale, Ten Little Indians. Though the  ending has been changed, the film conveys a regal story crafted by a master  mystery writer. Barry Fitzgerald and nine other individuals are invited to  spend a weekend on an island. However, their host springs a surprise  leading to the first alarm, some dies. Enjoy Cats are turned into seductive women stalking the men about town. Only after kitty plays, she kills. It was all right.  But, I prefer the story  and cat-like portrayal in ""TOMCAT: Dangerous Desires"" with  Richard Grieco.--that's terrific. What if there existed a document that could dismiss the transfer of Hong Kong from Brits to China? Rob Lowe plays Sean Dillon, a spy trying to gain  evidence of that secret on behalf of Britain. But, as he engages his  assignment, he is caught off-guard by a beautiful distraction, Deborah  Moore. Good flick for Rob Lowe. No James Bond, though. Starring Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson, Maria Ford, and Vince Murdocco. Kickboxer gangs take it to the street. Great martial arts. Good  action flick. Iffy-iffy on story depth. We got it to satisy family fans who  like Don Wilson! Baron Kurt Von Sepper (Richard Burton) has just married wife # 7, Anne (Raquel Welch) and invites her to live in his secluded castle. While  puttering about, Anne finds a mysterious golden key and a secret passage  that leads into evidence of the Baron's murderous past. In order to get a high-paying job, Beverly Dngelo bluffs her way into a nanny's position. SHe never mentions her ex-con days as a thief. But when  she's had time alone, she decides to sell the kids. Only nobody wants the  little monsters who have plans for Bev too! It's fun, light laughs, good  family flick. A scared illegal immigrant witnesses a homicide and comes to a Texas sheriff played by Brad Johnson. But, the case is not easy, considering who  is the murderer. What complicates this story even further is that the  Sheriff falls passionately in love with the witness. It's that aspect that  we adore with 4 stars. *G* Though Dvd has not been released yet, I can only tell you how much I've enjoyed seeing this on PBS and wanting this for reasonable home-ownership price. ... Angela Landsbury is great as Sweeney Todd's hilarious cohort running the ""pie making/barber shop"" on Fleet Street. The tunes, the acting, the entire glory of the cast,costumes, and decorations making this production---outstanding. I've seen the other versions---this one with Angela Landsbury is, in my opinion, the best! We purchased the DVD based on the many claims that the movie was a terrific addition to the world of entertainment. Yet we were very disappointed with this predictable piece of pseudo-drama. There were a few highlights giving credit to why Adrien Brody is off to a great career. But the story and picture quality...not worth a third of the money. Skip this one. Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman, and Mathew Broderick play profession-thief grandfather, conservative father, and innovative-genius son. When genius son invites Gramps in on a hiest, Daddy gets upset and vows to do anything  to stop them. But the sins of the father, inherited from the grandfather,  make piety a difficult sell. Terrific crime caper with many unexpected  twists. Starring Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson, Maria Ford, and Vince Murdocco. Kickboxer gangs take it to the street. Great martial arts. Good  action flick.

A94QJ3Z8G7936," If you have the Anchor Bay release of this movie, you will want this Disney version.  The Anchor Bay version is letterboxed for old, square TVs, which means it is surrounded on all sides by black bars (windowboxed) when displayed on a more recent widescreen TV.  This new Disney release is mastered with a 16:9 aspect ratio, so it fills your screen. I think you have to like Shakespeare to like this movie.  I don't, which I know is a mortal sin, but there you have it.  Perhaps I have too often heard the chimes at midnight.  Hard to believe some people consider this Welles' best film. I think I'm too used to Ian Carmichael to really appreciate Edward Petherbridge in the role of Lord Peter, and Richard Morant is nowhere near as good as Glyn Houston playing Bunter, but it's still an enjoyable watch for a mystery buff like me. I bought this just to have the first 3 episodes ot Doctor Who.  Watched them once and didn't much care for them.  Hard to understand how the series took off from these.  But that's just me.  I suspect if you grew up with these, you'll love them. These are 1980s American made-for-TV movies, which should provide a hint about the quality, which ranges from below average to average, in my opinion.  Still, it's always nice to see people like Peter Ustinov and Bette Davis on the screen. Mildly interesting films from very poor quality prints.  Some films are pretty good and some are laughable.  I particularly liked films in THE SHADOW series.  Echo Bridge Home Entertainment (ebhe.com) has them cheaper than Amazon. This is a great series; I enjoyed it immensely.  Dinged it one star because it's not subtitled.  Between some thick accents and my failing hearing, I know I missed some good dialogue. Good movies in unbelievably poor packaging.  Three trifold cardboard thingies in a slip case.  Mine arrived looking like it had been stepped on.  Half of the discs have unplayable spots on two different players, a Sony & a Pioneer.  There are minor scratches on the discs due to the packaging,  but the scratches don't seem bad enough to cause the playback problems. The good news about this disc is all of the never-before-seen home movies and other material.  The bad news is it was originally intended to be two discs and then some idiot decided to make it one double-sided disc.  Apparently the covers had already been printed, since the text refers to disc one and disc two. I actually like this remake better than the original series, although I agree with the other reviewers who decry the lack of aging makeup on the characters.  Damian Lewis is terrific, but I think Nyree Dawn Porter made a better Irene. Although the Region ABC symbol is clearly printed on the back cover, the disc won't play in my region A player.  It DOES play in another player I have that only plays region-free discs.  To paraphrase somebody in Animal House, Thanks Mr. Disney, can I have another? Great having Foyle back, although I don't think Horowitz should be so obsessed with keeping things in strict chronological order.  I would have been happy to see more mysteries set in the World War II time frame.  Also, they should have brought Milner back.  The three were a team. At last - all of the Bonds in one set.  Takes forever to watch; you spend two hours watching the movie and six watching the extras.  The ones with Roger Moore were better than I remembered.  Only real stinker is Lazenby's.  Even Diana Rigg doesn't help it. I was expecting this to be great based on what some friends told me, and it exceeded my expectations.  One of the best episodes ever.  How wonderful to see Tom Baker again, but he should have had more screen time! Most disks are scratched, and many don't play properly.  It appears to be a manufacturing defect, because the scratches are all similar and circular in shape rather than random lines.  This is the DVD set, not the BD set. I don't know why, and I'm sure not many will agree with this, but these movies just don't seem as good as when I saw them in the theatre.  There's a ton of extras in this set, but navigating the menus is a real chore. For the most part, a good film, but it would have been even better if Lancaster hadn't recut it to give himself more screen time.  Hiller took an Oscar for this film, and although I like her work and Wendy Hiller in general, I think the Oscar should have gone to Deborah Kerr.  This picture is a good example of Rita Hayworth late in her career.  Sappy opening theme song really detracts from the film. At last, SLEUTH comes to DVD.  Unfortunately, it's not a new scan of the film.  The format is letterboxed for 4:3 televisions, which means on today's 16:9 displays, there is a black bar on all four sides of the picture (windowboxed).  Many displays will let you expand the image to fill the screen, with an accompanying loss of resolution (sharpness).  There are no extras on the disc, and no subtitles.  It's better than nothing, but barely. Arkadin gets the usual lavish Criterion treatment with lots of extras, including a paperback novelization.  Three episodes of an Orson Welles radio show are also included, and they show how parts of Arkadin's script were lifted word-for-word from the shows.  As for the movie itself, I was unimpressed. Outside of THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS, a great set of Marilyn Monroe movies, but what really makes this set worth buying at any price is THE FINAL DAYS.  The SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE footage is also good. Enjoyable bunch of films.  Not hilarious, but still good.  George Cole as Flash Harry is terrific.  Those who downgrade their ratings because the collection is Region 2 are idiots who can't read. Mostly stupid stories with only a few good ones. Unbelievably low production values - makes early Doctor Who look good.  Interesting only to see people who became big stars later when they were just starting out. I've heard this series mentioned so often over the years that I had to buy it.  It starts out a little unevenly, but quickly gets much better.  It's really very good.  Note that this set is Region 2, so if you live in North America and don't know what that means, DON'T BUY IT. Great collection of stories, photos and home movies from Chicagoans who were alive in the 20s, 30s and 40s.  No disc menu - program starts as soon as the disc spins up. Very funny fiction about an actual event in World War II.  Kind of a British Hogan's Heroes, with less slapstick.  I found it very entertaining.  Too bad the Beeb doesn't make this and others like it region-free, so more people could enjoy them. This disc is a DVD-R, not a pressed DVD, which means it costs more than it needs to and it is likely to have quality problems.  WTTW was also thoughtful enough to include the original commercials. :(  This is a shame, because these programs hosted by Geoffrey Baer are wonderful and easily worth five stars. There are terrific extras in the form of episodes from Chicago Stories and the original 1999 production of Chicago's Lakefront. SHIP OF FOOLS is one of those films made in the 60s that tries to be ""relevant"".  I didn't care much for it at first, but there are parts that are really good.  And on disc, you can skip over the slow bits.  I thought LILITH stunk. I was creeped out by MR SARDONICUS when shown on TV in the 60s and thought it still holds up.  As another reviewer says, Oscar Homolka is great.  BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN was awful. It's a good enough bunch of movies, but nothing as racy as the Forbidden Hollywood moniker suggests.  Too bad the disc is a DVD-R instead of a pressed DVD.  DVD-R discs cost more and can have quality issues. This would have been a much better series if it was straight documentary instead of ""docu-drama.""  The actors playing Hitler relied entirely on a brush mustache and lots of shouting for their portrayal of the Nazi leader, truly comic performances.  Historical footage was superimposed in brief flashes on flat surfaces in the picture - very annoying.  That said, I DID learn some stuff I didn't know before.  You may enjoy these as long as you don't expect too much. This disc is a DVD-R, not a pressed DVD, which means it costs more than it needs to and it is likely to have quality problems.  The producer of the disc was also thoughtful enough to include the original commercials. :(  This is a shame, because the program is wonderful and easily worth five stars. There are terrific extras in the form of episodes from Chicago Stories and other things, including the complete original Walking Tour program. These Cinerama films are much better than I expected.  They're a great time capsule of life in the fifties.  The restoration job is nothing short of phenomenal; the films had deteriorated quite a bit by now.  The only thing missing is captions.  I particularly like the extras that feature interviews with people who were in the film or worked behind the camera. These Cinerama films are much better than I expected.

A2MQ03GBHLHQRA," They don't make movies like this anymore.  It just goes to show you don't need a lot a special effects to make a good horror movie.  The monster in the water and the one on land are two different actors. Murphy is the sole survivor of his crew, that has been massacred by a German U-Boat in the closing days of World War II. He lands on the shore somewhere on the river Orinoco delta and begins to plot his vengeance. He wishes to sink the U-Boat that has floated up by means of any method imaginable to him.  Great story.  Surprise finish. An injured, unconscious man (Richard Chamberlain) washes ashore in a small French town. As he recovers, it becomes quite clear, someone is trying to kill him. Jaclyn Smith co-stars.  Great acting.  Good story.  Movie is way to long. Samuel Jackson was the only reason I watched the movie.  The movie itself just wasn't interesting.  Christina Ricci looked great.  She has turned into a beautiful woman.  The technical part of the movie was great.  The entertaining part was boring. Ashley Judd (what a lady).  Her and Hugh Jackman are priceless.  Every scene between them is worth watching over and over.  The chemistry is so good.  Not much of a story (who cares). They don't make movies like this anymore.  No special effects, just a good story and great cast.  I like the DVD because of the wide screen and the ability to scene select. The quality of this movie is not what I would expect from a movie made this recent.  Sharon Stone is very good.  It's nice to see her in a role where she does not take her clothes off. Every episode is the same.  They change the item that Banacek is hired to find.  His companion always has a stupid solution, which is way off the mark.  He is constantly at odds with the insurance investigator.  She also always has the solution.  The sad part is I really like George Peppard. Every episode is the same.

The sad part is I really like George Peppard. When a younger girl called Emily Rose dies, everyone puts blame on the exorcism which was performed on her by Father Moore prior to her death. The priest is arrested on suspicion of murder.  Good acting.  Special effects were overdone. This is one of Melanie Griffith's best movies.  It's nice to see her in a role where she isn't the dumb blonde.  She plays the part of a very intelligent attorney. A fair movie.  The quality of this DVD was the worst I have ever had.  The entire movie was so dark I could hardly make out what was going on most of the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AVNVBCEAEW0YT," This is not remotely 'Animal House' level.  This is trash.  Why?  Because it pushes so hard with nothing to push for.  For sure, every actor gave his or her ""all"" in this rotten film. I like this movie.  It's watchable, and I enjoy it as a piece of fluff, (although doubt Carrie Fisher is a fan of it).  But the scene where Dennis Quaid's 'Jack Faulkner' - hacks up his lungs, in what has to be the longest, (bad), gratuitous, morning hacking scene in movie history, is enough to make me decide against watching the movie.  Why did Mike Nichols allow this?  Was it considered a classic hawking?  Academy Award potential hawking? It's hard to believe only 5 years passed between the original and the remake.  All the actors look as though they'd aged 10 years, which, if you had to work in this rotten film, is understandable. More.  There needs to be more Whoopi Goldberg on film.  I watch movies I loathe, like, ""Ghost,"" solely to watch her performance.  And Penny Marshall?  Her direction could not be better.  Great story from all writers involved.  I have the VHS tape.  Detest DVDs - very happy. Appalled by this interpretation of humor.  Detestable characters from the start.  Unfortunately, this was a gift.  Considering whether it's right to deposit the movie in the trash and acting as an ultimate censor, or subjecting anyone to it by putting it in a free bin.  I think the former. Ms. Bullock is in this movie, (and gives an excellent performance in her small, but pithy part), but this is not a Bullock movie for those who want to view Bullock.  This is a neatly-crafted, 1989-vintage ethics and morals spoof on what happens when success becomes your god.  (In this case, George Plimpton). The women and the men are despicable characters.  This movie is an affront to all women and men, but certainly to Black women and men.  One character has an affair with a married man whose wife he claims to love above all else and is dying from breast cancer.  This movie is getting thrown in the landfill where it belongs. The story has absolutely nothing to do with anyone's work, and nothing, whatsoever, to do with life, unless one considers the sum total of life to be polyamory and absence of sense of self. That's it.  No lust for food, nor drink, nor even nature.  No having a laugh.  Any depth attributed to this movie is the invention of the viewer. Maddening film.  Too much focus on externals, and viewers are given almost nothing of any depth.  Had the movie been uncut, (but edited), and ran whatever length was required in order to convey the story, perhaps I would not feel like screaming at the vapor trail that was this film.  Not even a ""highland mist."" The film is perfectly cast.  Perfectly acted.  Eric McCormack's Captain Kirk impersonation is worth the price of the film.  It's dead-on.  William Shatner is always fun - always ""enterprising.""  Bottom line? Whatever 'bible' we live by, we all need one, whether it's Star Trek, Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, or (name your own). Best of all? The movie is fun. It's a peep show without any value except for those with prurient interests.  There are devastating breaches of trust, without follow-through, save for the suicide attempt.  All the adults are cold-hearted, narcissists who care only about self-indulgence.  The daughters are not even an afterthought.  It is as though they do not exist, save for the statutory rape. Yes, it's important to suspend intelligence, and knowledge of the subject when watching this film.  But if you can, the film is quite a bit of fun.  Having seen absurd portrayals of many cultures and ethnicities and genders. including my own, this is no worse - not that that's good - but it is a movie, and a Hallmark production true to its genre. Speaking to Honeysuckle Creek folk, of course the movie is not a documentary, but they agree that it is a wonderful film.  The cinematography is outstanding.  The characters are genuine and full of heart.  The music direction is perfect.  Archived film of the era, etc., is outstanding. Incredible timing.  Nathan Lane is exquisite.  While there are moments in the film that could have been axed, overall, it's a riotous film.  Mike Myers is genius.  And Michael Caine?  He could be in a monkey suit and command a scene. A good story with good actors does not require the kind of opening trash that is in this movie.  It was ejected after 7 seconds - at most.  Nightmares, we can get from reality.  We'd been looking forward to a good con story - not this. Painfully horrible.  Amy Adams cast as yet another completely self-involved woman.  ""Predictable"" movies need not be horrid, but this one takes the cake.  Unbelievably, it is not unlike watching 'Julie and Julia' - but without the redeeming factors and other actors in that movie.  Directors and producers really need to stop catering to a public which seems to enjoy stories about women who ceased to mature at the age of 12. Solely a vicious assault on the senses aided and abetted by technology.  The fact that so many people liked this, and things like it, is testimony to the degree to which they are overexposed to the incessant input from electronic devices. Guy who is supposed to be president and distant cousin, in his car in a field, uses his position to get a hand job.  That's the movie.  This movie gives Deep Throat a good name, because that movie was honest.  Whoever bankrolled this, wrote it, filmed it, should find an old movie theater with a very dark back row and have at it, but leave the viewing public alone. Now, the soap operas are mostly gone, to be replaced, ostensibly, with wretched pieces of claptrap like this.  Making matters worse, Piven, is horribly miscast.  Yes, thousands of positive reviews can be wrong. The story is as genuine as it is insightful.  There is not a single fault with the script, the direction, nor the cinematography.  It is such a perfect portrayal, that I was stunned by the impact of the film. I love Whoopi Goldberg's acting.  All actors were superb in this movie, but the ending is so disappointing - so wrong for 'Sarah Collins' and her daughter, that when re-watched, I will stop the movie before the tournament scenes.  The script is such that it is not predicatable, and then... it deep sixes at the end. It was 1966 when this film was made.  The good guy in this film is the black football player who knocks the cameraman. Hinckley, over during a play.  He is so remorseful that he caters to Hinckley like a slave.  He is so remorseful he takes to drink.  Meanwhile, Hinckley an his amoral brother-in-law attorney jolly it up.  The actors are superb in their roles, but the film is nauseating. Margaret Rutherford's Jane Marple, I can watch endlessly.  Some Katherine Hepburn.  That's it.  That's all.  When watching these shows originally, the era was such that it supported NOT being a pseudo-single, and/or ""career"" woman, so it was tolerable to watch for the ensemble cast.  As women have gone backwards in development, I don't want anyone modeling herself on the 'Mary' character.  Better to be 'Rhoda' or 'Phyllis' - best to be, 'Lou Grant'. It is nauseating to see Columbo portrayed, and see Peter Falk portraying him, in this near-dementia manner.  The dialogue is hideously bad.  The sole redeeming factor is the increased incidence of backfiring from Columbo's car - an apt commentary on this grouping.  All episodes are unbearable.  Why did they all allow this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A1RVU25PXXUVAR," ....never did care for the tall alien that got out of the spaceship, but I still love the movie. This is a classic from start to finish. Not the greatest in terms of acting in some of the scenes, but there is just something about this flick that really sucks you in. Give it a watch........... I saw this for the first time when I was 10yrs old, thought it was great. Now 64, I still think the songs are wonderful... especially the caretakers song. What a hoot. If you have children, this movie should be a real treat for them. Merry Christmas...... ....really liked this Japanese inspired martial-arts, scifi movie. Of course, having Milla Jovovich starring in it doesn't hurt either. Even though I don't watch many movies like this any more, there is enough good storyline to keep it going. Enjoy!!! ....never did care for the tall alien that got out of the spaceship, but I still love the movie. This is a classic from start to finish. Not the greatest in terms of acting in some of the scenes, but there is just something about this flick that really sucks you in. Give it a watch........... ...really nice flick. Kristen does a great job... along with all the others. Good script, and I really liked the surroundings. Almost felt as if I was watching my own hometown....... Worth the watch. More of a 3.5 star movie, but I liked it... so 4 it is. This is one heck of a bumpy ride. Jolene is a movie I would have past on had it not been for Jessica Chastain. But after watching, I'm glad I chose to watch it. Really fun movie but definitely dark in some scenes... still, very much worth a watch!!! ...I've seen this as an animation but this showed a completely new perspective. Although I'm older, I thought this movie was very well done on many levels. Glad Amazon rented this at a far less price than they normally do. That was to my benefit and I appreciate it. ...I thought this would be a lot better. Not sure what the problem is, but after 45 minutes of watching this guy fall in love with an OS I lost interest. It might have been the double date scene that was pretty lame. Not sure any actor could have pulled this off....... ....this is definitely one of the better sci fi's I've rented. Wished it would have been longer but I suppose the producers would have added a bunch of boring fillers. Can't say anything else or I'll spoil it for you. Suffice it to say, you will be sucked into this fairly quickly. Very good movie!!! ...wow, just when you think you have things figured out you realize you're on the wrong train. This is definitely a five star movie and props go out to Ethan Hawke who is def one of our most underrated actors. This movie will leave you a little confused but well satisfied. Grab the popcorn and enjoy. I thought this was a really good movie. The acting is great and the storyline keeps you guessing all the way to the end. Give it a watch, you won't regret it. ...great film. This is one for those of you who have a sweetheart in your life. Also for those of you who've had one at least one time or the other. Pretty decent young adult film. Just skip ahead in a couple of places and you'll be good to go. Acting is amateurish and the storyline is very linear but still worth watching. Give it a shot, I've tried to watch worse. ...this was like, perfect. Both Kristen and Jessi get an olympic 10!!! Great movie for all of you who have skipped this just too many f'ing times. This has got it all: thrills, spills, frying pans and chills. Loved it...especially the humor!!! Another great performance by John Travolta. The only reason I watched this movie was because of JT. However, after finding out this was based on actual events, I'm really glad I did. No big bells or whistles, just cut to the chase movie. Good acting by all. Medium paced flick that I'm glad I watched. Take the time to watch... ...this was such a good movie. I liked the humor in it.... even the bad guy humor. Wow... and Phillip Seymour Hoffman did such a great job in his role. Well, everyone did...... You should all watch this, you will def be entertained!!! I'm not a scientist and would have really appreciated graphics on some of the information talked about. The speaker does however enlighten us that nothing has been published yet so he is unable to show us graphics or films during his lecture. I still enjoyed it, although I was also looking forward to the audience asking questions which are cut out of this presentation. ...this wasn't bad. A decent case file movie that doesn't let on until the end. Acting by everyone was good and the script was pretty tight except for one part. I'll let you figure that out. No bells or whistles but plenty of action. Give it a watch.......... This turned out to be better than I thought it might. The acting was really good and the story line was also good... considering it's a vampire movie. It's a little campy in some places, but with a better script and direction I believe it might have been better over all. Give it a watch, it's a decent flick. This is the second time I've watched this film. Not a lot of bells and whistles, but a great idea and good script. The acting is a little weak at times during the weepy scenes, but being emotional and crying in any film has to be one of the hardest things to do for any actor. I still highly recommend the movie......... Like you've probably heard before, this is actually a 3.5 star movie. I liked it okay, but this reminds me more of a made for TV movie. Not terrible mind you, just very predictable. Give it a watch though, its worth it. ....this is the second time I've watched this. Despite some of the reviews, just watch this for yourself. It's a very good movie. Wish the ending was a little longer... but sometimes maybe what we get is enough. Good acting, good script and well worth the price to rent. Enjoy. I liked the movie. The script could have provided us with a little more story line, but sometimes ya' just have to go with the flow. Great acting and the cinema was beautiful in some spots. Definitely recommend!!! I gave this movie three stars because of the overall ambiguity of it, but it is definitely an average sci fi flick. You will get lost in the open storyline, but the way the film is made makes me think of Blade Runner a bit. Give this dark mystery a watch, but don't expect to be totally fulfilled at the end.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A20EEWWSFMZ1PN," Do you think grumpy is natural? Think again. Learn from the experts, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They really make an odd couple ""Odd Couple, The"" - Neil Simon (1968).  Neighbors John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon), and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) have always been friendly rivals that play practical jokes on each other. Things really heat up with the arrival of a vivacious neighbor Ariel Truax (Ann-Margret). Great get off the ground instructions. Describes equipment and food terminology. This series with Chef Bill Briwa will give Martha Stewart a challenge.  At first it seems a little strange as you are expecting more of a documentary style. What you get is a full fledged chef that challenges you to experiment.  I am going though the series for a second time to see what I missed while thinking at the time he was demonstrating. I usually do not like collections as they always have at least one dud. In this case, however you cannot go wrong with Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. We all have our favorite songs so I will not repeat them all in this review. A better overview would be to read the individual reviews.  The extras make the collection worth collecting. There are different versions of our favorite movies. Janice Starlin (Susan Cabot) head of a cosmetics company was told the she needs to stay young to promote the product. What can she do? Enter garage scientist Eric Zinthrop (Michael Mark) with a dubious formula made from wasp royal jelly. He explains that ""just a little dab will do you."" She gets greedy and shoots up with the extra strong stuff. This gives her a BUZZ and can have biting consequences. Standard tale of witch being smoked and cursing the smoker. Long before the Terminator, in this Italian based vampire/witch movie she threatened to be back.  Looks like not much money in the way of props and blood went in to this black and white movie. Some of the ideas were borrowed form Bram stoker.  Barbara Steele was big in her time and played many creepy parts. Yet parts of her were excellent. This movie is formula and much of it is easy to anticipate. There are many ""stay in the car scenes."" The actors are knowable and the action or anticipation is non-stop. It even attempts at morals and loyalty. This movie was designed to pass time. Let's hope this is not a reflection of reality. Do you think grumpy is natural? Think again. Learn from the experts, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They really make an odd couple"" Odd Couple II, The - Neil Simon's (1998) ASIN: 6305127700."" The box set is perfect for long nights when you just got to keep going after the first film. This will look good on your video storage wall. And you only pay for shipping once. Typical Disney manufactured for the proletariat; this is a standard up-to-date fairytale scenario.  Twins separated at birth live different lives until they meet again. They find that they will have to work together to free their homeland from the darkness.  Naturally it is the last person you would suspect. We as viewers get an early view of the culprit so we can kibitz. But we can never guess the outcome.  Oh no not a sequel! Original title ""Beyond the Rising Moon"" (1987)  An above average hybrid named Pentan (Tracy Davis) is trained to do the dirty work for the corporation with the threat of being dispatched on failure. She sissies on an opportunity to escape and become normal but rich and makes her break for it. The rest of the movie is the obligatory chase scenes.  If you like this type of movie than you can not miss ""Serenity"" (2005). In 1923 Cecil B. DeMille filmed ""The Ten Commandments"" at Nipomo Dunes in California. There he buried the film set after making the picture.  This film has a Hallmark feel to it and does not take too much time to make CGI look real.  With all the negatives it is still fun to pass the time with if you like all the sci-fi quickie movies where evil pops up mostly in desert scenes. In 1923 Cecil B.

Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard (Matthew Boulton) is baffled, as there is no pattern to the madness. Sherlock Holms (Basil Rathbone) on the other hand knows that it is the alleged to be dead Professor Moriarty (Henry Daniell) and the fingers point to a more sinister crime. This is an excellent six hour presentation. I knew much about the time. Or at least I thought so until this presentation. The detail and pictures bring the time and problem to life. Now we can see the problems of this day as a reflection of prohibition and its side effects.  Includes the following episodes: ""A Nation of Drunkards."" ""A Nation of Scofflaws."" ""A Nation of Hypocrites.""  Narrator Peter Coyote Based on a book by Geoffrey C. Ward There are enough standard disasters to create two parts totaling at least 174 minutes.  The same standard characters and dumb movie that aggravate the disaster and us.  A fancy new space shuttle is built with a new propulsion system. It inadvertently goes off course and triggers an ""Exploding Sun."" On top of that there is a love triangle or two. Are we all goners? Watch and see. Four women, who previously worked at Bletchley, nine years later, pool their unique talents and resources to solve enigmas as save lives.  Even knowing it is only two seasons it is worth the purchas. This actors are a great mix. The director has dome much better with other movies. The formula is proven by many people that get tiered of originality.  So what went wrong, the slowness and spoon-feed morality just made for a boring experience. Some movies start off slow and pick up, but not this movie.  The story in general is a curmudgeon is settled with a kid and asks a neighbor to help. Soon he mellows out by the experience. This is the standard story of a tontine of sub humans in search of N.S.D.A.P. gold in a sunk sub. We get all the standard characters, claustrophobia, and a plot twist or two.  Jude Law as Robinson the boss caries the movie.  Of course you will want the Blu-Ray with the film commentary by Kevin Macdonald. I was expecting a documentary. This was a taped recording of an interview of Marlene Dietrich by Maximilian Schell.  The voice over of Marlene was interspersed with film clips from various movies and performances.  The bulk of the time is of Marlene saying Read My Book.  May be good to add to a collection. However it is not the best introduction. A failed spoof on Sci-Fi genre luckily, this is a movie about how to make movies. It is designed to teach you how to keep your actresses from losing their heads, or from losing any other appendages.  The movie's main thrust seems to be concentrated on upper torso frontal extensions (several pair). While observing this movie, I learned about the fast forward button. And suggest you do the same. Security specialist, Rick Knowlton (John Ritter) upset by a life-threatening incident is invited to live in a secure closed society ""The Colony"". At first the parents, children and family dog are happy. Then people get over antsy about nitpicky rules. This masks something more sinister.  If you are familiar with computers you may notice this movie is a little dated.  Warning if you can not watch cruelty to dogs and ferns then you may find this upsetting. Yep it is another one of those movies in the ""Airplane"" genera. When they do not try to hard some of the areas are funny. One really has to be in the mind set for this movie. If you have seen others like ""Airplane"" then this movie will not be as impressive as it could be. If this is your first foray in to the world of puns and parodies it holds its own. If Peter Lorre (Rosenberg, Austria-Hungary [now Ruzomberok, Slovakia]) can be Mr. Moto ""Mr. Moto's Last Warning (1939),"" then Boris Karloff (Camberwell, London, England, UK) can be Mr. Wong.  Actually, these six films are quite entertaining. I paid a little less, but they were on VHS. The DVDs being a set will save on shipping. They may last a little longer also. So put on your thinking hat and buy the set. Other than that this is not that spectacular of a presentation. Occasionally you may want to use the fast-forward button. The close caption leaves something to be desired.  I suggest rent other than buying as reputed watching will add very little to the presentation. This 1998 film is narrated by Shirley MacLaine (of ""John Goldfarb Please Come Home"" 1965 fame). We get to know Louise Brooks from her own words and those that met her. There is some great stock footage and in the end you feel that you know her better and that she actually talked to you.  The next time you watch her movies you will see them through new eyes and a new appreciation for her acting style.

However, Hercules has a thick Austrian accent.  Hercules is bored with Olympus after centuries of the same old faces. He takes a sojourn to New York against his fathers wishes.  Hercules, does not count on culture clash and loose animals (wild zoo bear.)  Will his Zeus send someone to New York to retrieve his son? Or will he be influence by a wild Hera? Maybe that is because that is what he is.  I was expecting an expos&eacute; with a Mickle Moore want-a-be.  I turned out to be mostly a love story between man and chic ken alike. This is one of John Ashley's better Pilipino exploitation films.  We are what we eat. It is a beastly movie with a soft porn touch. John Ashley makes a deal with the devil (Vic Diaz) to serve and munch.  On the production side there is too dark of a filter. Stilted dialog not absolutely wooden. This is not really worth suffering through other than an example of Ashley's repertoire. It looks like Bulldog (John Howard) is getting married to Phyllis (Louise Campbell) and giving up the detecting racket.  Only this time the movie stats out with Phyllis' kidnapping. From there is Bulldog formula.  The copy I watched is an Alpha Video poor quality 1937 version at 58 minutes.  The screenplay based on ""Bulldog Drummond and the Female of the Species"" by H.C. ""Sapper"" McNeile.  <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bulldog-Drummond-and-the-Female-of-the-Species/dp/B000E397KW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bulldog Drummond and the Female of the Species</a> Yep it is your standard ""if you do not believe me you're dead"" story.  A nasty spirit poses as the tooth fairy. A complete series of situations where two people Kyle Walsh (Chaney Kley), and Michael Greene (Lee Cormie) that saw the fake fairy and are going to get theirs; in the mean time there is lots of collateral damage to friends and foes alike. Not much more to it. Do not expect any originality or plot twists. A sales preview film that is a synopsis of movies from Full Moon Entertainment. However the editors did a sloppy job of splicing the movies together to form ""nothing of value"". I am not sure it is even good for a shopping reference film as there is not enough meat to make a decision. They do refer to classics, such as ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death."" This package is Benny Hill. However it is either the way they cut a particular program for this presentation or the show is not quite as amusing as I remember.  What I was expecting was more like what is that in the road? A head and what is this thing called? Love.  Im not sure it would be worth your time to watch this presentation if you have positive memories of Benny Hill. This is one of the crumbiest movies you will come across. It is too cheap to be campy. Very low budget. Barrowed the Sleestak suits from ""Land of the Lost""  a 1974-1976 TV series.  A tad of blood, but mostly running, running, screaming and screaming.  Basically the world is being attacked by aliens for nefarious purposes. The poor aliens never dreamed with we would shoot them down with an old stile anti-tank weapon the just happened to be available. People are being robbed on the Midnight Limited. So on of the robbies, Joan Marshall, (Marjorie Reynolds) teman up the the top railroad detedtive Val Lennon (John 'Dusty' King) to track down the culprit.  They may get more then they ask for; it may posibley be murder.  Stilted wording, cheap singing, too many clues, and dumb plot. The advantabe of the dumb plot si you get to say That is a dumb plot. The story has been told several times; mostly better than this movie.  A composer loses his hands in an accident. They are replaced in surgery. He decides that because he cannot play the piano immediately that it is a conspiracy; the composer sets out to rectify the source of the problem.  One interesting spot Sally Kellerman plays Sue. Strange to see her so young.  This is just one hand replacement movie such as Hands of Orlac Yes this presentation is unnerving to people trying to keep data safe. However it goes way beyond that to cyber wars and quantum computers, using Q-bits. Then goes way beyond to some exotic speculations.  It has people talking about personal experiences. We even get pretty detailed information on how to. We get clear diagrams.  This is worth the purchase as you can slow down and pick up some interesting information and have time to think about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A3BVJP1DNKNJ0I," Good acting, and there's some suspenseful parts that keep you on the edge of your seat, but overall I wasn't impressed. I didn't even finish watching this movie. I only watched about half of it, then turned it off because I was getting so bored. Would not recommend. Fantastic movie. Good acting, beautiful cinematography, twisted and interesting characters, suspenseful plot, etc. This is my favorite performance by Tom Cruise.  Note: There are numerous scenes of blood-sucking vampires killing people all throughout the movie. Just a fair warning for anyone who's squeamish about that sort of thing. Maybe it's because I'm an adult, but I just couldn't get into this movie. The plot was too predictable and kind of boring, in my opinion. However, I can appreciate the fact it's a wholesome family-friendly movie that kids would probably enjoy (which is why I still gave it 3 stars). I love this movie. It's a fun, family-friendly, fantasy adventure tale that never gets old. I remember going to the theater with my family to see it opening day over 20 years ago. I still love it now as much as I did back then. I liked the beginning of this movie a lot. The actresses who play the aunts are fantastic and really bring those characters to life. But beyond that, I got bored and the plot never went anywhere. I ended up fast-forwarding through the last 3rd of the movie because I just wanted the movie to be over at that point. I'm an adult. Kids, on the other hand, would probably like this movie and its interesting style of animation. This was one of my all-time favorite movies as a kid. The last time I watched it was nearly 23 years ago, before renting it on Amazon recently. Still as good as I remembered. I'm also amazed by how many lines from the movie I remembered despite not seeing it in such a long time. Anyway, this is a great kid's movie that I think any child would love. Adults too! The first time I saw this movie was in 1999. The powerful memory of this movie has stuck with me that whole time, for nearly the past 20 years. I recently saw it again on Amazon. Still as good as I remembered. The movie's overall message is very deep and thought-provoking. This movie was very entertaining and visually stunning. It far exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting to like it because I assumed it was going to be just another Disney romance. But it was NOTHING like that. The plot took me by surprise and had several adventurous twists and turns that I wasn't expecting. 5 stars. This movie was just ""okay,"" in my opinion. I found myself getting bored from time to time. Then again, I'm an adult - so maybe that's why it fell flat with me. Kids, on the other hand, would probably love this movie. Wow. This is THE most boring, pointless movie I have ever watched in my entire life. I was tempted to turn it off after the first 40 mins, but at that point I just started skipping ahead, desperate to find an interesting scene. I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you want to risk dying of boredom. In which case, Lord have mercy on your soul. This movie wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either. I would rate it somewhere in the middle as just ""okay."" Some of the acting looked amateurish and the scenes were a bit choppy. Good acting, and there's some suspenseful parts that keep you on the edge of your seat, but overall I wasn't impressed. I didn't even finish watching this movie. I only watched about half of it, then turned it off because I was getting so bored. Would not recommend. This movie was just ""okay."" The visuals and computer graphics are stunning. However, the acting and character development fell flat, and the whole movie just seemed very pretentious. The plot had potential, but it just got confusing and didn't really go anywhere. This is not a movie I would watch again. I admit, as soon as the movie started I wasn't impressed and thought I was going to hate it. But as the movie developed, it got better and better and by the end I thought, ""That was a really fun movie!"" This is the kind of movie I think the whole family would enjoy. This is a fun movie that I think kids would really like. The overall storyline is interesting and creative. My only complaint is Sarah Silverman's voice (as Vanellope von Schweetz) was like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard. Ugh. I admit, as soon as the movie started I wasn't impressed and thought I was going to hate it. But as the movie developed, it got better and better and by the end I thought, ""That was a really fun movie!"" This is the kind of movie I think the whole family would enjoy.

It got kind of boring in several spots. I hear it was a kick-butt movie for its time (it was originally released in 1979). But movies have come a loooong way since then, so compared to modern movies, it's just ""okay."" However, I was impressed by the acting. I thought the acting was really good, even though the plot was slow and a little boring at times... I loved this movie so much as a kid. I recently watched it again for the first time in 20 years, and it's just as good as I remembered. It's a fun, wholesome, entertaining movie that I think any family would enjoy.

A25A88AMQBGBRD," One of the all-time greatest thrillers, Silence of the Lambs will leave your heart pounding. The performance by Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lechter is one of the all time greatest, and will hook you in even with his limited screen time. The dark atmosphere permeating the movie perfectly sets up the darkness of the story and the villain, and does not let you go until it's over. It is fascinating to see the seeds of Spielberg's career being sown in this film. There are shades of Jaws everywhere, and the tense action on display would help to distinguish Spielberg for years. I very much enjoyed this movie on its own merits, and beyond that as a ""history lessen"" for on of the greatest directors of all times. I have always felt that Timothy Dalton was a very good Bond. ""The Living Daylights"" does away the campy goofiness of the later Roger Moore Bond films for a much more satisfying, serious tone. A stand-up entry int he long-running series that I feel does not get as much credit as it deserves. While not my favorite Wes Anderson film (Moonlight Kingdom by a mile), Grand Budapest hotel is a very entertaining movie on its own. Great performances by the supporting cast, however Ralph Fiennes shines extremely bright. A great movie that is sure to please fans of Anderson's movies. This movie is so delightful, and charming. The songs are classics and the animation makes you feel like you are watching a storybook come to life. A classic that I will be showing to my kids for years to come. The quintessential horror/mystery/suspense/supernatural show. It's interesting to see where it all started, and how the relationship between Mulder and Sully developed into what we all know own today. Even in this first season, the plot was already intriguing and the monsters already thrilling. A great place to start, obviously, if you have become hooked by the new episodes, or even better if you want to experience them again. This is and has been one of my favorite Pixar movies since it first came out. I watch it every couple of months and still love it as much as when I first saw it. I can't wait until my daughter is old enough that I can share such a special movie with her. Definitely not up there in quality with Disney's greats, Home on the Range was still enjoyable. I like the animation and thought the jokes were funny. We bought this DVD to complete our Disney collection, and I think kids will enjoy it. With 5 great movies in one collection, this was a great collection for my dad who loves the Marx Brothers. The newly restored picture quality is a great way to enjoy these movies for the first or the 100th time, and the bonus material is a real treat. My wife and I still watch through this series form time to time. These early seasons contain some of the essential creepy monsters of the week, and fantastic story arc episodes. I absolutely loved this modern take on the classic film noir. The contemporary setting of a modern high school presents all the typical film noir character archetypes with great performances from the young cast. I thought the direction was fantastic in setting the mood of a crime movie taking place with young adults in a school without ever feeling ""silly"", with a palpable amount of tension constantly building throughout. One of the all-time greatest thrillers, Silence of the Lambs will leave your heart pounding. The performance by Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lechter is one of the all time greatest, and will hook you in even with his limited screen time. The dark atmosphere permeating the movie perfectly sets up the darkness of the story and the villain, and does not let you go until it's over. A fantastic movie about the power films, imagination, and dreamers, I absolutely loved this movie. The performances are terrific, especially from the young stars, and the supporting cast of veterans is top-notch. It's easy to see why this movie won the Academy award for cinematography and special effects, as both aspects of Hugo are dazzling. Fans of classic cinema, adventure, and historical fiction should definitely not miss Hugo. An exceptional movie that delivers powerful performances and a gripping story. An important story that sheds light on an industry that seems to be disappearing, and a cautionary tale about unchecked power. A fantastic movie about prejudice and preconceived notions that is still immensely important today. Featuring a gripping performance from Henry Fonda that is incredibly powerful, and amazing supporting cast. Essential viewing for those learning about the justice  system, or for anyone who needs to learn about where we came from, and where we still need to go. The penultimate season of one of the greatest sitcoms of the generation. The show stayed strong, with classic episodes and great guest stars. The dvd set is a great way to watch the season, since Netflix does not show the extended episodes you can find here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A31RM5QU797HPJ," and Hamlet is taking out the trash!  Jack Slater (Aronld) is a LA cop who is teamed up with Daniel Muggian.  Daniel is from OUR world, via a magical ticket that old Nick gave him.  Jack Slater is Daniel's hero.  There has been several Jack Slater movies, as we see that this is ""Jack Slater IV""  that Daniel was watching when he enters the world of movies.   An Underated movie! Atticus Flich (Peck) is a lawyer who is defending a Nergo named Tom from a crime he didn't commit.  Atticus is unpopular because he's defending a negro.  A great movie AND a great book! I read the book first before I watched the movie.  Atticus Flich is the #1 Hero on AFI'S list of 100 Heroes & Villians. Eddie Valient (Bob Hoskins) has a case and he's teamed up with Roger Rabbit!  Roger is wanted for the murder of Marvin Acme the owner of Toon Town.  Eddie doesn't much like Toons cause a Toon killed his brother.  As the movie goes on, Eddie starts to like Roger and his zany ways.  This ground-breaking movie won 4 awards, including Best Visual Effects. The story of Pokemon: The First Movie is a dark one.  Mewtwo, a cloned pokemon, hates humans and how they treat pokemon.  So, Mewtwo causes a storm intending to rid the world of humans and the weak pokemon.  The story is almost too dark for pokemon. The Secret of NIMH was a dark story filled with dark acts and even darker characters.  Secret of NIMH 2 is a complete and utter disgrace.  NIHM 2 has nothing in common with the oringal.  Timmy would've been better of dead then star in this awful movie. It's a machine that flies in the air, but that's not important now.   One of the funniest movies ever made!   Airplane! is a comedy classic pure and simple! The laughs come fast in this movie! There's no more to say if you watched the movie. If you haven't watched the moive, then watch it! ""Weird Al"" fans, rejoice!  This is the movie you'll want to see if you're a ""Weird Al"" fan!  And now, its coming to DVD!!  woohoo!   This movie is both funny and stupid, but who cares? It has ""Weird Al"" in it! Quite possibly the best Don Bluth movie ever made.  Mrs. Brisby has to move her home before the tractor wrecks it. The only problem is that Timmy--one of her son's--is very ill and cannot be moved.  She goes to the rats of NIMH for help.  Meanwhile, Jenner plots to kill the leader of the rats.  This is way better than the sequel.  No songs in this one. I would rather have my eye poked out than watching a movie about a whinning kid who wants a BB gun for christmas for god knows why, maybe shooting the kid who put his tongue on a frozen flagpole on a dare. This sequel has got to be the dumbest sequel since Caddyshack II.  Junior and Ben Healey move to a house which has the address of ""911"" There, Junior meets a girl rather like him. One of the better black and white scifi movies from the 50's.  It may not have today's special effects, but compared to the scifi movies that were made back then, the day earth stood still is fine art. The Doctor and Romana visit Paris to see some great art.  When time begins to repeat itself, the Doctor suspects something is wrong. This adventure has possibly the best witty lines, as in:   ""That Would look silly.  We'll thake the lift""   ""My dear, no one can be stupid as he seems""   and a lot more lines! FUNNY parody about the Beatles done by Eric Idle (of the Monty Phython movies...wink,wink,nudge,nudge)  and a bunch of guys from SNL and real rock stars like Mick Jagger. The Rutles are four lads from Liverpool and are called the ""pre-fab-four""   This is a good movie if you're a Monty Phython or Beatle fan. This was a great TV series when it was on.  It's about a bunch of 1000-year-old Gargoyles that are revived in modern-day Manhattan.  There, they meet friends and enemies.  Kinda reminds me of the Highlander TV series with all those flashbacks, which are mostly in Scotland. This movie marked the end of ""Turtle Mania"" and by the time the movie came out, the Ninja Turtles were on their way out.  But, I will always like the Ninja Turtles.  They were the bomb.   The third and final turtle movie isn't as good as the first two, but its worth watching at least once. The most famous phase in a Star Wars movie is ""I have a bad feeling about this"" and its made by Obi-Wan (Ewan McGreggor) and i can't decide if he's talking about the movie itself, or the annoying Jar Jar Binks.   Great DVD, so-so movie. Casper the friendly ghost lives in an old mansion along with 3 other ghosts.  When a ghost chaser (Bill Pullman) and his daughter (Ricci) enters the mansion to get rid of the ghosts, Ricci becomes friends with Casper. Meanwhile, Pullman focuses on the 3 other ghosts that ""live"" in the mansion.  This is first ""normal"" role for Christina Ricci, who was in the Addams Family movie as Wednesday. Cave Dwellers concerns Miles O'Keffe ripping off Hercules in this bad sword and magic flick, in order to save the world from a ""rear view mirror"" or so Tom Servo says.   The skits are funny, even the mock begining the three put on.  This is the best of the worst here.   The three come up with decent commentary.  Truly a classic! Robin Williams stars in this delightful movie about a game called ""Jumanji"", a game that must be finished.  If the game is not finished, then the game will wait however long you stop playing the game--even for 26 years.    The special effects are execellent, even by today's standards.  This is a much better movie than Zathura Great disney movie!  Great songs by Billy Joel, Huey Lewis and The News and others.  Oliver, a homeless kitten, meets Dodger (voiced by Billy Joel)  and his gang.  Soon, Oliver is living on 5th Avenue living the life until he is ""rescued"" by Dodger and the others. The first season of The Simpsons is on DVD! The 13 episodes that launched the Simpsons into our living rooms are on this DVD. The first season is a little wet behind the ears, but that hardly matters to a Simpson fan.  On Each episode there's commentary by various people who work on the show.  This is great for any Simpson fan! Con Air is a great movie!  It's a fast-paced action flick filled with bloodly deaths and bodies that has ""Larkin"" written all over them.  Cyrus Grissom (Aka ""Cyrus the Virus"") takes over a plane that is carrying crooks and rapist, and a madman.  Cyrus calls the flight ""Con Air"" when him and others take over the plane. But, one person likes to be home to celebrate his daughter's birthday.  Poe (Cage) attemps to mess up Cyrus's plans. If Walt Disney and Hitchcock would've made a movie, it would be this.   Mima is a pop idol that wants to go into acting.  But, she is soon haunted by her pop idol self, who thinks she is the real Mima.  This movie is one of the best anime titles I ever saw! The year is AC 195, Operation Meteor:  Five Gundams are sent to Earth.  The Earth-Sphere Alliance tells the public that the five objects were shooting stars, and not Gundams.  But, one person knows that's a lie.   Very good introduction to a great series, Gundam Wing Operation 1 introduces you the main characters of the series: The Five Gundam Pilots, and some people from OZ.  There's no Zeon in this Gundam series. Max, the son of Goofy, goes to college in this sequel to ""A Goofy Movie""  At College, the X games are there and Max, PJ and Bobby want to win the College X Games instead of the 5-time winner of the X Games, the Gammas.  Goofy joins Max's college (much to the anger of Max) and join the Gamma team.  One of the better disney sequels. Long ago, this played on Cartoon Network.  It was on very late night, and it was just before Toonami.  For the most part, they didn't edit much of the movie.   D, A half-man/haf-vampire hunts vampires wherever he goes.  This time, he's up against Count Magus Lee, a very old vampire.   This is one of the first anime movies i ever saw. Long ago, this played on Cartoon Network.

Rocky and Bullwinkle are on thier way to New York City to stop Fearless Leader (Robert DeNiro), Boris (Jason Alexander) and Natisa (Rene Russo)  from turning all of American into vegetables with RBTV!  Just usual, Bullwinkle has all the great lines.  This movie is filled with comedy, adventure and...more comedy! Mel Gibson plays a yankee rooster in a house of british chicks.  Ginger, leader of the chickens, wants Mr. Rhodes (Gibson) to teach how the other chickens how to fly.  A great family film! We are yet on another trip to Jurassic Park.  This time, a couple is searching for a boy that is lost on the island.  Allan Grant (Sam Neill) is hired as a dinosaur expert.  On the island, there are new dinosaurs.  Why can't they stop making Jurassic Park movies? Washu invents a machine that can create alernate dimensions, such as the Pretty Sammy universe where Sasami rips of Sailor Moon and Ryo-ohki can talk.  Ryoko, Kiyone, and basically everyone get sent to these weird dimensions, in the meantime, Washu is trying to bring everyone back to their own dimensions.  Time and Space Adventures Parts 1,2 and 3 are all on the DVD. A man makes a time machine and travels forward in time to see man's progress.  He goes so far forward in time, that the land is unfamiliar to him.  A good scifi adventure! Memphis (Cage) is a retired car thife.  He must steal 50 cars in 72 hours, or his brother gets killed.  With that said, the movie is a good action flick with plenty of nice car chases.  I don't get why people hate this movie. Charlie's Angels are three woman working for a millionaire named Charlie.  But, they don't ever get to see Charlie. They talk to Charlie via a speaker provided by Bosley (played by Bill Muary)   Someone is after Charlie in this movie, but why?  The girls stop an evil plot to kill Charlie and save the day. Watership Down is an animated movie, but not for children under eight.  The movie gets violent at times, but not graphic.   Watership Down is about a bunch of rabbits who seek a new home, because their old home was destroyed by humans.  Along the way, they have adventures.   Once they have reached thier new home, they realize they don't have does (female rabbits), and no does means no kittens!  A great movie! The World of monsters is powered by children's screams and Sully (John Goodman) is the top scarer of them all.  Sully is aided by an one-eyed monster called Mike (Billy Crystal).  If a human child (or any item owned by a human child) enters the world of monsters, 23-19 is yelled and the CDA comes along and takes care of it.  A good and funny movie! Allan Quartermain is called to hunt a villian called The Fantom.  With Mr. Quartermain, is a league filled with extraordinary gentlemen; Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Mina Harker, Dorian Gray, Mr. Skiiner, Dr. Jekyll (and Mr. Hyde).  Together, the League tries to stop the Fantom, who was the man that called the league together.    This movie is a fantasy, people.  It's the superheroes of the 1800's vs. Dr. Moriaty.  It's not supposed to be realistic.  It's a fun adventure movie! In 1940, Issac Asimov wrote I, Robot.  I, Robot was a series of short stories about the Three Laws of Robotics.  The movie version of ""I, Robot"" does a good job of updating the stories.  Del Spooner is a detective that hates robots, and he is called to solve a mystery surrounding U.S.R.  I would like to think that Asimov would like this movie.  However, look at what happend to Robert A. Heinlein  on ""Destintion Moon"" George Carlin is a funny little (bleep), but not for little (bleep) kids, you know?  Because George Carlin isn't for kids.  His most famous routine is updated as he adds more words you can't say on TV.  Very funny man! Frank (Bill Muary) is a slob, and his eatting habits are just gross.  Frank eats a dirty egg from the zoo. Inside the egg, a deadly virus named Thrax (Laurence Fishburne) who wished to make medical history by killing Frank. Enter Osomois Jones (Chris Rock) and Drips...err...Drix (David Hyde Pierce). Jones is a white blood cell and Drix is over-the-counter cold pill.  Drix and Osomois Jones work together to stop Thrax. There's a lot of things wrong with this movie.  First off, it isn't a cartoon.  It's a live-action movie with a CGI Scooby Doo.  All the Scooby Doo elements are in this movie, which makes it enjoyable for fans of the show.   I think Scooby Doo was a lot better as a cartoon. Kagome is a 15-year-old girl from Japan who lives close to a shrine.  She falls in a well and ends up in ancient japan where demons roam freely.  Kagome spots InuYasha stuck to a tree with an arrow in his chest.  InuYasha appears to be asleep or dead when Kogome finds him.  Later, Kagome is forced to reawaken InuYasha in order to defeat another demon.  InuYasha is only half-demon and wants to be a full-demon. The village is attacked by Yura of the demon hair and InuYasha (with the help of Kagome) defeat her. Then, InuYasha's bigger brother comes along and is looking for the tomb of his father to get a powerful sword. New York Film Critic Jay Sherman (Jon Lovitz) reviews movies like ""Rabbi Pi"" , ""Howard Stern's End"" , and other movies.  The movie clips are really funny. It failed on ABC, it failed on FOX, it even failed on Comedy Central and it really failed on the Internet!  But, it won't fail on DVD.   The short-lived series is funny no matter how you look at it. Season One ends with a botched assassination attempt on the seemingly unkillable Koro Sensei--albeit it was very clever and well-planned but for naught.  Koro Sensei pulls out his ""trump cards of trump cards"" to avoid almost certain death but at an inpertune time as the students of 3-E fall serevely sick due to a madman.  Yes the class goes on vacation at the beach.... and for once it's not filler! Treize, the leader of OZ, has tricked the Gundam pilots to kill the leaders of the Earth-Sphere Alliance.  The Gundam pilots thought they were killing members of OZ, but they were fooled by Treize!   Meanwhile, Zechs discovers a flaw in the tallgeese and we learn that Relena is Zechs's sister!  Zechs wears his mask as a sign of shame we also learn. Tenchi Universe is the best Tenchi TV series.  It stars everyone from ""Tenchi Muyo!"" and it's longer and better.   Tenchi is a teenage boy that finds two women from outer space. One of them is a space pirate, the other is a member of the Galaxy Police, looking for the space pirate Ryoko.   This is a fun series and I never tire of watching it over and over and over and over and over again. The MST3K crew makes this...movie watchable.  It's one of the worst movies they ever did.  The movie, about 6 lovely women trying to stop kids from taking drugs, was made in the 70's.  Good Cause, ladies.....but it makes a BAD movie. In the first espiode of this DVD, Kiyone arrives and suprised to see all the people within the Masaki Household.  Kiyone is forced to stay on Earth as Resident Officer with Mioshi.  Kiyone is one of my favorite characters. The Third Volume of Tenchi Universe is called ""On Earth III"" and that's mostly true.  The last espiode, they actually go to Venus and try to free Tenchi from a bounty hunter that's Ryoko's arch rival.   The gang gets to deal with Mecha-Washu in the first espiode of this DVD.  Mecha-Washu is Washu's creation (duh), but has Mioshi's brain!  Mioshi gives new meaning to the word ""Airhead"" as she is dense.  I feel sorry for Kiyone! A schoolgirl called Hitomi gets transported into another world, where the Earth and moon both hang in the sky. Hitomi soon finds out that the Earth is called ""The Mystic Moon"" on Gaea.  She meets Van, who is a prince, and Merle, a half-cat/half human person.   Hitomi, Van, and Merle try to unravel the legendary power of Atlantis.   A great anime series! Rowan Atkinson stars in this parody of the long-running Doctor Who.  Joanthan Pryce makes an execellent Master.   The Doctor meets with the Master and tells him he has fallen in love with his lovely companion and says he will travel in time no more.  The laughs come fast in this parody!  Also on the tape are behind-the-scences taping of the parody and 3 comedy sketches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ASL61YP0GQGBB," The classic first alien movie by Steven Spielberg. Although the effects may seem a little outdated and slow, the acting is what has always made this movie great, and Richard Dreyfuss is superb as the father who loses his family and thinks he's losing his mind because he saw UFOs and is driven beyond all reason to discover what is happening to him and others who shared the same experience.  One of the best movies made in this lifetime. A so so X-Men saga that I believe was outdone by X-Men First Class. However, if you want a good X-Men movie may I recommend Deadpool, and that you skip this completely The classic first alien movie by Steven Spielberg. Although the effects may seem a little outdated and slow, the acting is what has always made this movie great, and Richard Dreyfuss is superb as the father who loses his family and thinks he's losing his mind because he saw UFOs and is driven beyond all reason to discover what is happening to him and others who shared the same experience.  One of the best movies made in this lifetime. Great thriller with many twists and lots of violence. Bradley Cooper is great as is Robert De Niro. A rags to riches story with a drug fueled boost. Fun to watch Cooper in this role. Thrilling tale of a little girl raised to be a super soldier. Well acted, and well directed, with a breakout role for Saoirse Ronan. Excellent Cinematography, locations, and music make this a visual and sonic masterpiece. Very well acted by all. A tense thriller that keeps you engrossed until the fitting end. Great thriller with Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Time travel and meeting your younger self are all wrapped into this well crafted action-thriller. Would you like yourself or listen to yourself if you met yourself 25 years into the future? This movie asks that question and does a good job of hashing out the issues.

Would you like yourself or listen to yourself if you met yourself 25 years into the future? This movie asks that question and does a good job of hashing out the issues. Tom Hanks is fabulous as always in this role of a cargo ship and it's crew being terrorized by African pirates. Based on a true story many of us watched play out on the news. great ending and good to see the bad guys get what they deserved. Hysterical! Plenty of Mick, and he is funny. Very gory. Unnecessarily so, but who's complaining? I love these ridiculous movies. It's a good funny sequel to the original and more sober film. For two scenes in the movie, all you need to know is the phrase ""Tie me kangaroo down mate!"" Too funny. Too many holes in the plot for it to make any sense to the watcher. Ryan Reynolds does a good job, but you pretty much hate everybody else. Story is about child abduction, exploitation, and pornography, but the filmmakers are too scared of the subject matter to make any real comments about the people who do these crimes or their victims. Ultimately it's unbelievable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AGVFRDMWG7JL0," A classic Sci-fi! I just showed this film to my friend earlier ""Which he had not seen before'' And he loved it! The graphics are still good and interesting to look at. Which in some parts in the movie you could tell that it aged a bit. Which still does not ruin the movie! Worth Watching!!! My favorite live action Disney movie! This movie has been around for 61 years, and it still holds up. If you are an Animal lover or not, get your tissues out, because this is a sad heart-touching film! I finally got to see this movie. And WOW, the action throughout the movie was intense!! Tons of explosions and shootouts. And it was amazing! You can tell they put a lot of effort into this film! I highly recommend this!!! Classic punk movie! You have to give this movie credit for only being on a budget of 1.5 million dollars. Which back in 1984 that would be compared to 3 million$ now. I bought this as a gift for my mother. We both watched this together. It is a little slow paced in some parts BUT it does it quite well. I am not into romantic movies, but this one is quite exceptionable!! I have finally got to see this movie. And I see why this film has all the hype! If you are an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan or a fan of action movies in general, then this is a must see. This movie has a bit of the 80's cheesiness, but it does it so well. Defiantly a good movie to watch with friends! Great movie!! Follows a couple in a time of a civil war in Russia! It was a brutal war indeed. Lasting 5 years and Killing around 1 up to 5 million people! This film is like the Gone of the Wind of the 60's. My only complaint about this masterpiece is that they replayed some of the songs a few times throughout the movie, BUT at-least it was beautiful to listen! A great movie with not much of a plot! Just about the life of living in the Italian hood of the 70's in New York City!! A good movie and great acting, with young a Robert De Niro!!! Very dark movie INDEED. This Movie is very inspiring! It is very entertaining for all ages! I am 18, and I very much enjoyed this movie! This movie teaches you that sometimes things are not what they seem to be! And to never give up! This movie is very old (1939). But the message is timeless! I finally got to see this movie! ( Mainly why I wanted to this movie was because of young Johnny Depp and old Vincent Price!) This movie is quite different, after all it's directed by Tim Burton, you know you are in for something when your watching his films. I've seen this movie once now, and I'll most likely see it again! it's one of those movies with replay value. Django (1966) is an epic western classic! And also very violent for how old it is. You can see some of the influences from this movie had on Quentin Tarantino. Also I like to mention is to not watch the dub of this movie, you will not like it unless you are used to cheesy dubbing. I recommend going into the menu on the DVD and switch it to it's original language with subtitles! Still epic after 50 years!!! A classic Sci-fi! I showed this film to my friend ""Which he had not seen before'' And he loved it! The graphics are still good and interesting to look at. Which in some parts in the movie you could tell that it has aged a bit. Which still does not ruin the movie! Total Recall is defiantly in the top 5 Arnold Schwarzenegger movies. I was going to buy Above the law (1988) ''By itself'' and I so happen to notice this 4 disc collection that includes Above the law, and 3 other Steven Seagal films. It was the same price as Buying one movie. An Awesome Movie! I have just seen it for the first time, and I enjoyed it well. A bit slow in some areas of the film, but it does not ruin the movie at all. Throne Of Blood (1957) is worth watching for a good samurai movie! Came quickly and I am very happy! FLCL (Fooly Cooly) is an awesome anime! I would say it is the best short anime series ''in my opinion'' with only 6 episodes!! It is wacky and serious at the same time! This anime is soon to be 15 years old, and it still holds up well. And the animation is very well done. I'll give this anime 10 out of 10!! It is a must see series!! Six Mummy Movies! Comes in 3 Discs. The original Mummy movie (1932) has it''s own disc. Disc 2, holds 3 movies. while the last disc (Disc 3) holds 2 movies! Well Worth it for the price! And I love the cover art of the case! An Awesome Movie! I have just seen it for the first time, and I enjoyed it well. A bit slow in some areas of the film, but it does not ruin the movie at all. Throne Of Blood (1957) is worth watching for a good samurai movie! I am not a fan of Rap. BUT I must say that this was an awesome movie!! I was very surprised that this film did not win any awards!! P.S. The DVD does not contain the directors cut! LOVE hand maid may! I completely forgot about this anime! I seen it when I was a child! I am so glad that I found this anime again. Brings back memory's! This classic anime still holds up for an anime that is a few years away from turning 20 years old!!! Good classics. In my opinion, the best movie out of these 6 films, is The Last Detail (1973) with ''Jack Nicholson'' which he won (Best Actor) in this movie. Worth it for the price of 6 movies? YES!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
